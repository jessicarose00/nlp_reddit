Campaign to Ban Face Recognition at U.S. Colleges Gathers Steam,1,ev5wwi,https://gizmodo.com/campaign-to-ban-face-recognition-at-u-s-colleges-gathe-1841302162,1,1580248623.0,,2020-01-28 16:57:03,1
"Best SSD vs worst SSD, is the price difference worth it?",0,ev5tlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ev5tlv/best_ssd_vs_worst_ssd_is_the_price_difference/,1,1580248109.0,"So even in the realm of SATAIII 2.5"" Samsung SSDs there is a huge price difference between the models, QVO, EVO EVO Pro etc.. the read/write differences listed seem to be minimal in comparison to each other, the life spans seem to be about the same and the error rates seem negligible, unless I am missing something.

Here is the rub, I am in a startup and we need to upgrade our servers to SSD's but cash is a little tight... spending $200 for each 2TB QVO drive vs $550 for 2TB EVO PRO drives when I need 16 is a huge price jump... $3,200 vs $8,800... how can I justify the premium? or should I ?

Use case - 4 2TB drives in RAID 5 - VMWare host with an Elasticsearch Data and Master node on each of 4 servers. Daily amount of data written across all disks is about 250 GB per day, then moved to SAN after about a month.

The idea is like what the Nintendo Switch is already doing.  Basically your phone keeps getting more powerful, how long until that is just your portable computer that does everything but then can be docked into other places like a shell laptop, tablet or desktop environment?

Doesn't sound crazy considering all the things your portable computer (phone) does now that replaced so many other pieces of separate tech.   I bet someday besides being your credit card too, you'll be able to dock your phone in your car as a way to operate the whole thing including autodrive.

edit

well I'm disappointed at the lack of creativity displayed by members of this subreddit.  Instead of trying to predict how tech will go in the future its a bunch of naysayers stating that since its impossible to do something right now, it can never be.  Thats just sad.  Given the advancements in computers the last 20 years its just so narrow-minded to assume technology won't keep advancing.  I set a reminder in this post and I look forward to seeing how far we've come in a couple years from now.  Thanks to those with open minds who understood what I was trying to post about.  Its a shame we can't have a real discussion instead of downvoting and dismissing.  peace among worlds!",2020-01-27 06:17:21,1

And it isn't even something that is harmful to society, like sharing anti-vac propaganda or something similar. Or organizing a Nazi rally or something. The stupid thing prevented sharing of a TEDx.

Was the religious zealotry in Europe responsible for delaying technology, or was everybody caught up in warfare? It just seems weird that it took hundreds of years for firearms to evolve to slightly-faster-firearms but it only took decades for things like missiles to become so smart they can hit anything.

Maybe the World Wars encouraged technological advancements to keep up with opponents?

And it’s weirder that Greek/Middle East/Asian zones seemed more developed than everyone else in the world in the BC eras, and even weirder that the American continents seemed like they were always in the Stone Age despite the rest of the world growing.

Largest Hotel in Miami (The Fontainebleau) is undergoing a ransomware attack and not a word in media,12,eqmwxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/eqmwxd/largest_hotel_in_miami_the_fontainebleau_is/,11,1579412915.0,"The Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach (1500+ rooms, worth $1bil+, \~$1mil in revenue daily) is undergoing a ransomware attack as we speak, and not one word in the media, the hotel won't tell guests anything about it.  

I have tried contacting everyone in the media I can (Miami Herald, Miami New Time, Krebs, Schneier, etc) and literally no one will respond, I think they think this is insane.

My understanding is that the credit card system at the Fontainebleau Hotel is hacked and being held for ransom.  My understanding is they have not issued hotel wide instructions, so some departments are ""cash only"" and other departments are swiping credit cards and storing it in the system, but it does not connect to your bank and they cannot authorize cards, or close out charges.  (I think they are hoping this will be resolved and then they can process all the saved credit cards later basically.)  My understanding is this happened some time between 9am-5pm on Thurs Jan 16th and they aren't telling guests anything, and the line to check in is crazy (because they cannot process credit cards like normal) - people are waiting up to 4 or 5 hours for rooms, and it is chaos.  There are people sitting all over the lobby with their luggage just waiting, are extremely angry, and they are not telling them anything.  And worst of all, they are still ""accepting"" credit cards in some departments (some of the restaurants for example) but aren't telling people in advance their credit card system is hacked, they are pretending everything is fine, even though it clearly is not.  They swipe your card, but you can check your account and see that it is not authorizing the card with your bank.  I do not know if the hackers are then able to see this additional credit card.  I do not know if they plan on paying the ransom.  ATMs on property have run out of cash (I do not know how often they are refilling them.)

No, I do not know how much they are asking in ransom.

I have literally no idea who to contact or how to do so.  So here I am on Reddit.  I am about to give up, everyone will find out in a few weeks I imagine.  All I know is a major convention is about to check in tomorrow (NATPE) and the Superbowl is a week later (1500 rooms at $1k+ per room/night), and they are literally unable to capture any credit card payments or collect any money at all (besides cash.)  All they will state is their credit card system is ""down.""  Also, their WIFI seems to be down.

Imagine if you were there swiping your credit card right now not knowing whether or not the hackers have access to these additional numbers, and the hotel isn't tell you, so you have no idea.

So, reddit, where is the best place to post this, or who should I contact before I give up?
