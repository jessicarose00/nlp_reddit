The Salton Sea Disaster,13,euv7go,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/euv7go/the_salton_sea_disaster/,0,1580191044.0,"The Salton Sea, located inland in Southern California, is an environmental disaster that seems like something from an earlier time, when human activities were making our great bodies of water unfit for life.

The sea was created by accident. In 1905, a canal in the Imperial Valley smashed through its banks, resulting in a torrent of water flooding into a low lying valley. By the time the spill was stopped, 2 years later, a sea was formed. For a time, the area prospered. It became a popular vacation destination for SoCal residents. 

But by the 80s, things took a turn for the worse. The rivers that fed the Salton were polluted with agricultural runoff, and as the sea has no outlets, this pollution had no place to go. Over time, the water got dirtier and dirtier. The lack of an outlet also meant it got saltier. The Salton became increasingly unable to support life. In the 90s, thousands of birds died from eating botulism infested fish and in 1999, 8 million tilapia died in one day.

In September 2012, residents in Los Angeles noticed a putrid odor, like raw eggs. What happened was the Salton, 150 miles away, had a great die-off of fish, which released a tremendous amount of sulfur gas. 

You might imagine that environmentally minded Californians would do something about this, but you'd be wrong. In fact, they've made it worse. Imperial County recently agreed to transfer more water to San Diego, [the result being 40% less water for the Salton Sea.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433294/salton-sea-crisis-drying-up-asthma-toxic-dust-pictures) 

As the Sea dries up, even more bad things are apt to happen. The seabed is filled with toxic dust filled with heavy metals. The wind will be able to blow this harmful dust all over Southern California. 

Plans to dig a canal to the Gulf of California or install desalination plants have been shelved due to cost. [In 2018, voters approved $200 million](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3879) to manage the Sea's decline by suppressing the dust of the newly exposed ""playa"". Whether this will work is an open question and even if the toxic dust is stopped, there's still the loss of habitat for fish and birds, the loss of tourism that the sea once provided, and that morbid stench that will serve as a reminder of the consequences of man's hubris.",2020-01-28 00:57:24,0

In the 60s and 70s, things were really, really bad. Our rivers and lakes were being rendered lifeless as they filled with raw sewage and industrial effluent. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was blunt in his assessment of the Hudson River. “The river from Troy to the south of Albany is one great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” There were advisories against swimming in the Great Lakes. The Cuyahoga river, famously, caught fire 13 times.

Our air was also being poisoned by emissions from automobile exhausts, garbage incinerators, and power plants. Southern California was blanketed with a thick layer of photochemical smog. A smog event over Thanksgiving 1966 in New York killed 168 people. 

The pesticide DDT was ravaging bird populations. It brought the Bald Eagle to the brink of extinction. 

Even Richard Nixon was speaking in dire terms about the nation's environment. In 1970, he said that if nothing was done, many urban areas would be uninhabitable by 1980.

It's now 2020. Our air is clean even over our largest cities. Our rivers and lakes are once again teeming with life. Bird populations have recovered. 

Whatever problems climate change poses, they are almost certain to be minor against what we faced in the years leading  up to the creation of the EPA. And for that we should be very happy.",2020-01-27 05:18:57,0

True climate action requires deficit spending. An infographic on why that's O.K.,15,euapoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/euapoj/true_climate_action_requires_deficit_spending_an/,2,1580092905.0,"The most conservative estimates of a Green New Deal in the United States are above $10 trillion. We couldn't tax all of that, so we'd have to deficit spend.

Many economists on the left argue that such deficit spending is not only ""worth it"": It's actually economically beneficial. One of them, Randall Wray, just testified in front of Congress about this. He is the co-author of a groundbreaking paper, [""How to Pay for the Green New Deal.""](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf)

I think it's really important for environmentalists like me to understand this, so that we cannot be scared by fiscal conservatives claiming ""expertise"" into diluting a climate budget. However, most literature is a bit dense for new learners, so I'm working on infographics to break down the ideas.

This infographic explains Sector Balance, part of the reason why U.S. deficits are beneficial. To my knowledge, sector balance itself is accepted by most mainstream economists, as the data is clear.

Some will disagree, and that's O.K. My hope is not to convince but to spark curiosity, and encourage environmentalists to empower themselves with economics. We will need massive spending to save the planet, and we should not be ashamed of it.

"Best SSD vs worst SSD, is the price difference worth it?",0,ev5tlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ev5tlv/best_ssd_vs_worst_ssd_is_the_price_difference/,1,1580248109.0,"So even in the realm of SATAIII 2.5"" Samsung SSDs there is a huge price difference between the models, QVO, EVO EVO Pro etc.. the read/write differences listed seem to be minimal in comparison to each other, the life spans seem to be about the same and the error rates seem negligible, unless I am missing something.

Here is the rub, I am in a startup and we need to upgrade our servers to SSD's but cash is a little tight... spending $200 for each 2TB QVO drive vs $550 for 2TB EVO PRO drives when I need 16 is a huge price jump... $3,200 vs $8,800... how can I justify the premium? or should I ?

Use case - 4 2TB drives in RAID 5 - VMWare host with an Elasticsearch Data and Master node on each of 4 servers. Daily amount of data written across all disks is about 250 GB per day, then moved to SAN after about a month.

The idea is like what the Nintendo Switch is already doing.  Basically your phone keeps getting more powerful, how long until that is just your portable computer that does everything but then can be docked into other places like a shell laptop, tablet or desktop environment?

Doesn't sound crazy considering all the things your portable computer (phone) does now that replaced so many other pieces of separate tech.   I bet someday besides being your credit card too, you'll be able to dock your phone in your car as a way to operate the whole thing including autodrive.

edit

well I'm disappointed at the lack of creativity displayed by members of this subreddit.  Instead of trying to predict how tech will go in the future its a bunch of naysayers stating that since its impossible to do something right now, it can never be.  Thats just sad.  Given the advancements in computers the last 20 years its just so narrow-minded to assume technology won't keep advancing.  I set a reminder in this post and I look forward to seeing how far we've come in a couple years from now.  Thanks to those with open minds who understood what I was trying to post about.  Its a shame we can't have a real discussion instead of downvoting and dismissing.  peace among worlds!",2020-01-27 06:17:21,1

Facebook censoring private chats,90,eua43q,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/eua43q/facebook_censoring_private_chats/,114,1580090367.0,"It is nothing new that Facebook is trying that 1984 thing. And I would kinda understand it if they censored what is posted on your wall, but censoring a private chat? Which mean (no surprise there) it is not all that private after all. The legality of such actions is questionable to say the least.

And it isn't even something that is harmful to society, like sharing anti-vac propaganda or something similar. Or organizing a Nazi rally or something. The stupid thing prevented sharing of a TEDx.

Was the religious zealotry in Europe responsible for delaying technology, or was everybody caught up in warfare? It just seems weird that it took hundreds of years for firearms to evolve to slightly-faster-firearms but it only took decades for things like missiles to become so smart they can hit anything.

Maybe the World Wars encouraged technological advancements to keep up with opponents?

And it’s weirder that Greek/Middle East/Asian zones seemed more developed than everyone else in the world in the BC eras, and even weirder that the American continents seemed like they were always in the Stone Age despite the rest of the world growing.

Largest Hotel in Miami (The Fontainebleau) is undergoing a ransomware attack and not a word in media,12,eqmwxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/eqmwxd/largest_hotel_in_miami_the_fontainebleau_is/,11,1579412915.0,"The Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach (1500+ rooms, worth $1bil+, \~$1mil in revenue daily) is undergoing a ransomware attack as we speak, and not one word in the media, the hotel won't tell guests anything about it.  

I have tried contacting everyone in the media I can (Miami Herald, Miami New Time, Krebs, Schneier, etc) and literally no one will respond, I think they think this is insane.

My understanding is that the credit card system at the Fontainebleau Hotel is hacked and being held for ransom.  My understanding is they have not issued hotel wide instructions, so some departments are ""cash only"" and other departments are swiping credit cards and storing it in the system, but it does not connect to your bank and they cannot authorize cards, or close out charges.  (I think they are hoping this will be resolved and then they can process all the saved credit cards later basically.)  My understanding is this happened some time between 9am-5pm on Thurs Jan 16th and they aren't telling guests anything, and the line to check in is crazy (because they cannot process credit cards like normal) - people are waiting up to 4 or 5 hours for rooms, and it is chaos.  There are people sitting all over the lobby with their luggage just waiting, are extremely angry, and they are not telling them anything.  And worst of all, they are still ""accepting"" credit cards in some departments (some of the restaurants for example) but aren't telling people in advance their credit card system is hacked, they are pretending everything is fine, even though it clearly is not.  They swipe your card, but you can check your account and see that it is not authorizing the card with your bank.  I do not know if the hackers are then able to see this additional credit card.  I do not know if they plan on paying the ransom.  ATMs on property have run out of cash (I do not know how often they are refilling them.)

No, I do not know how much they are asking in ransom.

I have literally no idea who to contact or how to do so.  So here I am on Reddit.  I am about to give up, everyone will find out in a few weeks I imagine.  All I know is a major convention is about to check in tomorrow (NATPE) and the Superbowl is a week later (1500 rooms at $1k+ per room/night), and they are literally unable to capture any credit card payments or collect any money at all (besides cash.)  All they will state is their credit card system is ""down.""  Also, their WIFI seems to be down.

Imagine if you were there swiping your credit card right now not knowing whether or not the hackers have access to these additional numbers, and the hotel isn't tell you, so you have no idea.

So, reddit, where is the best place to post this, or who should I contact before I give up?
