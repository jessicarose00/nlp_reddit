The Salton Sea Disaster,13,euv7go,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/euv7go/the_salton_sea_disaster/,0,1580191044.0,"The Salton Sea, located inland in Southern California, is an environmental disaster that seems like something from an earlier time, when human activities were making our great bodies of water unfit for life.

The sea was created by accident. In 1905, a canal in the Imperial Valley smashed through its banks, resulting in a torrent of water flooding into a low lying valley. By the time the spill was stopped, 2 years later, a sea was formed. For a time, the area prospered. It became a popular vacation destination for SoCal residents. 

But by the 80s, things took a turn for the worse. The rivers that fed the Salton were polluted with agricultural runoff, and as the sea has no outlets, this pollution had no place to go. Over time, the water got dirtier and dirtier. The lack of an outlet also meant it got saltier. The Salton became increasingly unable to support life. In the 90s, thousands of birds died from eating botulism infested fish and in 1999, 8 million tilapia died in one day.

In September 2012, residents in Los Angeles noticed a putrid odor, like raw eggs. What happened was the Salton, 150 miles away, had a great die-off of fish, which released a tremendous amount of sulfur gas. 

You might imagine that environmentally minded Californians would do something about this, but you'd be wrong. In fact, they've made it worse. Imperial County recently agreed to transfer more water to San Diego, [the result being 40% less water for the Salton Sea.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433294/salton-sea-crisis-drying-up-asthma-toxic-dust-pictures) 

As the Sea dries up, even more bad things are apt to happen. The seabed is filled with toxic dust filled with heavy metals. The wind will be able to blow this harmful dust all over Southern California. 

Plans to dig a canal to the Gulf of California or install desalination plants have been shelved due to cost. [In 2018, voters approved $200 million](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3879) to manage the Sea's decline by suppressing the dust of the newly exposed ""playa"". Whether this will work is an open question and even if the toxic dust is stopped, there's still the loss of habitat for fish and birds, the loss of tourism that the sea once provided, and that morbid stench that will serve as a reminder of the consequences of man's hubris.",2020-01-28 00:57:24,0

In the 60s and 70s, things were really, really bad. Our rivers and lakes were being rendered lifeless as they filled with raw sewage and industrial effluent. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was blunt in his assessment of the Hudson River. “The river from Troy to the south of Albany is one great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” There were advisories against swimming in the Great Lakes. The Cuyahoga river, famously, caught fire 13 times.

Our air was also being poisoned by emissions from automobile exhausts, garbage incinerators, and power plants. Southern California was blanketed with a thick layer of photochemical smog. A smog event over Thanksgiving 1966 in New York killed 168 people. 

The pesticide DDT was ravaging bird populations. It brought the Bald Eagle to the brink of extinction. 

Even Richard Nixon was speaking in dire terms about the nation's environment. In 1970, he said that if nothing was done, many urban areas would be uninhabitable by 1980.

It's now 2020. Our air is clean even over our largest cities. Our rivers and lakes are once again teeming with life. Bird populations have recovered. 

Whatever problems climate change poses, they are almost certain to be minor against what we faced in the years leading  up to the creation of the EPA. And for that we should be very happy.",2020-01-27 05:18:57,0

True climate action requires deficit spending. An infographic on why that's O.K.,15,euapoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/euapoj/true_climate_action_requires_deficit_spending_an/,2,1580092905.0,"The most conservative estimates of a Green New Deal in the United States are above $10 trillion. We couldn't tax all of that, so we'd have to deficit spend.

Many economists on the left argue that such deficit spending is not only ""worth it"": It's actually economically beneficial. One of them, Randall Wray, just testified in front of Congress about this. He is the co-author of a groundbreaking paper, [""How to Pay for the Green New Deal.""](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf)

I think it's really important for environmentalists like me to understand this, so that we cannot be scared by fiscal conservatives claiming ""expertise"" into diluting a climate budget. However, most literature is a bit dense for new learners, so I'm working on infographics to break down the ideas.

This infographic explains Sector Balance, part of the reason why U.S. deficits are beneficial. To my knowledge, sector balance itself is accepted by most mainstream economists, as the data is clear.

Some will disagree, and that's O.K. My hope is not to convince but to spark curiosity, and encourage environmentalists to empower themselves with economics. We will need massive spending to save the planet, and we should not be ashamed of it.
