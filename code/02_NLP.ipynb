brought alight solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe behind solar energy are solar panels the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs ever since solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for clean renewable energy the talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels how they work and their current day status solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization but it wasn t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun s energy it wasn t until the s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system solar energy all started based off an earth shattering discovery found by french physicist edmond becquerel this discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight as energy education puts it additionally the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution consequently becquerel would exclaim shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect later in willoughby smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium now used in solar panels today moreover in william grylls adams and richard evans day put the photovoltaic idea originally found by becquerel to selenium finding it could generate electricity when light hit it to no one s surprise someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in when charles fritts created the first ever working selenium cell charles fritts newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time as he hoped it would compete with edison s coal fired power plants on the contrary the new innovative selenium cell was less than efficient and had no chance of competing with edison s coal fired power plants as the solar cell wasn t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives generally the idea of solar energy wasn t a popular one at the time and wouldn t be for a while eventually the concept of solar energy was brought alight when albert einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy happening in hence albert einstein would win the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect he would receive the prize a year later in with the concept of solar energy gaining steam more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect it wasn t until when russell ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell different than the selenium cell invented by charles fritts in similarly like fritts selenium cell the new solar cell invented by russell ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time the energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only thus for every joules of solar energy hitting the cell only joule of electrical energy was created while this was an improvement from fritts cell it wasn t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide as previously mentioned the most groundbreaking substantial invention didn t come until when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by daryl chapin calvin fuller and gerald pearson after months of long grueling work the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented originally daryl chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas therefore turning to solar energy as the option he would later collaborate with calvin fuller and gerald pearson as they all invented the cell in unity truly this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a conversion efficiency much more than the solar cell invented by russell ohl or the selenium cell invented by charles fritts in fact the solar call had so much potential the new york times wrote the newly invented silicon cell may mark the beginning of a new era leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind s most cherished dreams the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies the solar cells costed over per watt the us military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the s the funding persited and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the vanguard i in for some time solar was still too costly for use until dr elliot berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell bringing the cost per watt down to just in the early s coincidentally in the energy crisis hit the us which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the us to turn to other energy options like solar in turn this made the us government committed to developing solar energy solar panels in specific as a feasible source of energy for future uses as a result jimmy carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the white house to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement evidently solar panels started to become more feasible as the golden era of solar panels for the s hit in the s during the s solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments by the s many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth for example in the university of south florida developed a efficient thin film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride just a short time after in the first ever solar cell exceeding conversion efficiency was made years later in a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted of the sunlight that hits it into electricity also in the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin film solar cells was hit marking in at in total growth between the s and s was crucial to solar panels expanding just in the worldwide photovoltaic production was megawatts in that number increased to megawatts in conclusion it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed today solar panels work in a very specific way for solar panels to work sunlight must be hitting the panel obviously if there is no sun the solar panels won t be working at that specific moment this is why at night solar panels aren t working like they are in the day anyway soon after the sun hits the panel the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun for the sun to hit the cell it must go through the frame glass and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel once the sun does hit the cell after passing through the first stages of the solar panel electrons begin to move around internally nevertheless a solar cell consists of a layer of p type silicon placed next to a layer of n type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers inside the n type there is an excess of electrons while inside the p type there is an excess of positively charged holes between the n type silicon layer and the p type silicon layer there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes once this is completed the p type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n type consists of positively charged ions moreover this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n type layer to fill the holes in the p type layer finally when sunlight hits the cell electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes all in all when the p type and n type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity in a residential solar makeup the solar panels convert the sunlight into dc energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to ac for use for all energy not needed it goes back to the grid in conclusion solar panels aren t too complicated and work following a basic method without the method present solar panels wouldn t be able to function as they do in today s era solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years in the last decade alone solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of amongst the us furthermore there are currently over americans working in the solar industry with over companies per state in discussion with cost the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from to now comparing the prices to years ago there is a huge difference in cost currently most solar is installed in europe and east asia which account for over of global installations the least happens to be in africa accounting for less than of total global installations installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in in there were no installations of solar in the us whatsoever by the yearly installation reached almost watts across residential pv photovoltaic non residential pv utility pv and utility csp the us has also been emphasizing solar with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since in that number was just in it was out of all possible energies nevertheless in the us california has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from california in fact california beats the next states combined in terms of annual residential pv installations by january st california is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels in terms of efficiency most solar panels have above conversion levels now there are actually different types of solar panels with different types varying per company finally solar panels can be found in solar farms on residential homes and commercial homes primarily it is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way to illustrate how solar is truly on the rise the global solar energy sector is projected to reach billion by up from billion in according to allied market research in conclusion it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future within years solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past clearly the history of solar panels is quite eventful the way they work is very fascinating and complex and their current day status is very promising without solar panels in life the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around not only this renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day less promising options like wind energy jobs would also be lost the economy wouldn t be the same and solar companies would seize to exist in a world without solar panels what would it be

feet and the damage done to our environment increases daily if we are to continue to exist without destroying ourselves the fundamentals and values of our society must be reevaluated and reformulated from the ground up the list provided in this document is a general framework towards achieving this end there are only two options that the human race is currently confronted with change or extinction one individual alone cannot easily change our society but enough like minded individuals cooperating collectively with dedication and hard work can achieve this goal the time has come to look past that which divides us and see how we can draw strength from our fellows a human race that acts as one cohesive indivisible unit is necessary for our own survival x b social equality and direct democracy a eliminate all forms of social stratification and social division b allow a well informed critically thinking public to make decisions and offer feedback via an internet based voting apparatus c use the scientific method to implement and update public practices and policies d any means of power centralization will be eliminated all decision making processes will be diffuse collective and democratic x b free green energy and responsible resource management a eliminate the profit mechanism b maximize efficiency and minimize waste in all industries c completely phase out the use of fossil fuels and convert to renewable energy sources d the need for manual labor will be phased out over time as automation technology improves x b freedom of information and public education a having a critically thinking and well informed public is of paramount concern thus comprehensive education will be made available to all citizens free of charge b exchange of information will remain unobstructed c the internet will be compartmentalized into two areas one area of objective fact based information where all information requires source citation and a second area of subjective opinion based information not requiring citation x b efficient infrastructure and public housing a all citizens will be provided with public housing free of charge the space occupied by living areas will be minimized b transportation s efficiency will be maximized while remaining safe for all passengers x b clean water organic food and public healthcare a state of the art healthcare will be made available to all citizens free of charge b all food and water will remain safe for consumption and free of harmful additives c any animals consumed will live a cage free existence d all citizens will be encouraged but not required to lead healthy life styles in order to minimize the frequency of preventable conditions and diseases x b freedom from the concepts of hatred and violence a any and all measures will be taken to prevent the loss of human lives excluding acts of violence b conflict mediation and resolution will be made available to all citizens free of charge c problem solving and interpersonal communication will be part of educational curriculum d militaries and weapons will be phased out and eliminated x b freedom from the concepts of nationality and surveillance a all nations and national borders will be dissolved b all citizens will be able to travel to any part of the globe unimpeded c covert collection of information will be outlawed x b freedom from the concept of organized religion a all mainstream religions have their own version of the golden rule but disagreements about which god is the correct one prevent it from being followed organized religion cannot exist in a world that is to remain peaceful b all forms of spirituality will be tolerated and encouraged so long as they do not advocate the judgement and persecution of others x b freedom from the concepts of possession and currency a all forms of currency will be eliminated the existence of currency will inherently lead to social division b all goods and resources will be declared the common heritage of the human race c all goods and resources will be distributed equally between all individuals d no individual or group may accumulate more goods and resources than any other individual or group x b freedom of goal attainment and artistic expression a any individual or group may strive to achieve any goal so long as that goal does not interfere with the well being of any other individual or group b artistic expression in any and all forms will remain unimpeded and uncensored c all citizens will be encouraged but not required to participate in both constructive and recreational activities x b x b the four sectors of the global collective guidelines for collectives and individuals x b in order to create a society that is the antithesis of the one we currently have a litany of changes are necessary the most notable of these is a fundamental reformulation of the way our social institutions behave today s institutions exist to preserve themselves and the status they hold within our culture institutions that are static meaning that they resist change to stay in place and maintain control are both inefficient and counterproductive we need a set of institutions that are dynamic as opposed to static a set of institutions that embrace change at every moment in order to become more streamlined and efficient as they evolve the following is a list of suggested institutions for the global collective these four sectors will replace our current political economic and educational institutions collective guidelines fundamental education and periodic inquiry a the institution of education will be considered the most integral part of the global collective groups of people will participate in the collective pursuit of knowledge these groups will be led but not controlled by individuals with significant experience in the specific field of study b in addition to study of specific fields of interest every individual will receive the same degree of general education the end goal of this general education is to cultivate individuals that are well informed critically thinking and inquisitive c both groups and individuals will be encouraged to ask any questions they might have furthermore at periodic intervals groups will be asked to take a step back and ask how and why everything works the way it does these groups will also be challenged to see if they can come up with any improvements or tweaks that could more effectively streamline a procedure or process resource sustainability and future projection a availability and quantities of resources will be updated in real time so that rates of usage never exceed rates of production these updates will be automated to the highest degree possible b levels of efficiency will be assessed and recorded so that action may be taken if a procedure or process is unsustainable constructive cooperation and analytical diagnostics a groups of willing and capable individuals will address and attempt to solve any societal problems that may arise these individuals will do so under the guidance of the scientific method so that they will remain objective throughout the process b problems will be analyzed as they arise the root cause of dilemmas will be diagnosed when possible when the root cause of a problem can be determined the solution should come from addressing the problem at its source as opposed to addressing the symptoms caused by the problem c groups of people will be encouraged to examine problems from different perspectives analysis of problems from varying perspectives will provide fresh insight into different methods of solving problems societal integration and dynamic feedback a groups of people will be encouraged to participate in recreational activities these recreational activities will promote both the release of stress and the strengthening of social bonds between group members b open expression of thoughts and ideas will be encouraged in any and all arenas upon completion of any activity educational constructive or recreational the participants will be asked to provide feedback about the procedure or process x b individual guidelines x b comprehensive education a background information relating to desired goal is provided b instruction is given about how best to achieve said goal by individuals who have already done so c instructors will answer all questions to the best of their ability resource management a any resources or facilities required for goal attainment are provided b guidance and assistance are provided by experienced individuals goal attainment a time and effort are put towards desired goal and either the goal is reached or the individual falls short b future guidance is provided to individuals striving to achieve the same goal c if an individual s goal is not realized reasons are noted to assist other individuals in the future expression and feedback a suggestions and feedback about the goal attainment process are provided suggestions are noted and implemented if doing so is practical b any artistic or creative urges relating to the goal attainment process are encouraged to be expressed x b x b x b on the maintenance of social equality x b class differentiation has existed since the foundation of civilization consequently it is hard to imagine a world in which it does not exist but our society is rapidly transitioning out of the industrial age and into the technological age if we are able to effectively phase into the technological age the creation of a utopia becomes a realistic possibility as technology continuously improves eventually scarcity will become an outdated convention in a world where scarcity is no longer an issue goods are produced in enough abundance to be freely available if goods are freely available and have no cost assigned to them the means of class differentiation disappear in order for society to move past classism society must also move past the definition of oneself by their material possessions the importance our current society places on possessions is a product of consumer culture moving past the dependence on ownership of objects is essential to the maintenance of social equality admittedly there are a lot of nice luxurious things in the world but the bond a person has with an inanimate object can never come close to the comradery of life long friendship real world connections with others are what truly matters furthermore a greater quality of life can be achieved by devoting one s time to pursuing passions this will create a greater degree of fulfillment than spending one s life pursuing status symbols the profit mechanism is the root cause of the majority of the problems our society faces today not only is it the source of the chasm between the upper and lower classes but it is the cause of extensive harm to our environment some people would argue that competition for the sake of profit encourages innovation but competition in the context of profit is counterproductive because competing parties are only striving to be marginally better than their rivals if a company were to make a significantly superior product than their competitors then they may spend too much to produce it and not turn a profit furthermore a vastly superior product that doesn t become obsolete within a few years would put the producer out of business planned obsolescence goes hand in with cyclical consumption and cyclical consumption goes hand in hand with unnecessary waste of resources and lastly the profit mechanism encourages harm to the environment this is the case because practices and policies that have the least impact on the environment are often the most expensive if a company can make more money by sacrificing the wellbeing of the environment they will do so the profit mechanism must not exist in a world that is to remain viable for human life many individuals find the root of their identity in their nationality by no means is culture a crime but at times national prejudices serve as a wedge that drives groups of people apart without the existence of nations the separation of peoples into competing factions becomes more difficult and the creation of collective cooperation at a societal level becomes more realistic religion and the devotion to one s personal god is a very sensitive issue but the fact that preference of one benevolent deity or another can oftentimes inspire deep seated hatred between groups of people is concerning and unsettling my hope for the future as should be yours is that people are able to look past their differences and put more emphasis on their similarities by doing this we will actually be adhering to the golden rule instead of deviating from it x b on improving the quality of human life x b in the global collective education will be the most fundamental part of our society currently education is primarily geared towards preparing people to enter the work force this means that all the resources and energy of educational institutions are spent grooming students to be active participants in an endless cycle of consumption learning solely for the sake of knowledge is a practice that is almost completely extinct in today s world the majority of people see knowledge or college diplomas as a means to an end the end of having a good job and enough money to be happy but this pursuit is a fallacy true happiness can be found in the pursuit of knowledge and engaging in logical discourse with those around you in the global collective exchange of information and ideas is essential to the continuous improvement of our citizens in the same theme of not defining oneself by their possessions people will also not be defined by the luxury of the house in which they live housing situations will be both practical and pragmatic never lavish or excessive people will have the choice of living alone in communes or with family members the major emphasis of healthcare will be on prevention as opposed to reaction a high degree of diseases and conditions that arise in today s healthcare systems are easily preventable if there were more proactive measures in place as well as a better mindset about health a new healthcare system with a holistic approach to health and medicine will work best for both the providers and recipients of care many people would argue that violence is an inescapable part of human nature but i would have to disagree with this assertion the only reason human civilization has progressed this far and become this advanced is our ability to work cooperatively there is still a lot of room for our improvement and this improvement could be more easily accomplished if the broader societal mindset placed less emphasis on individuality and more emphasis on collectivity the setting and realization of goals as well as the expression of thoughts and ideas are essential parts of leading a fulfilling life not only are these activities fulfilling but they can be therapeutic as well active engagement with the people around us and the world around us will help to combat the recurring dysfunction that we see in the world today x b x b concluding remarks and hopes for our future x b transforming our culture from one of excessive waste into one that is sustainable into the future will be a long and arduous process but it is a process that must be undertaken if we want to have a future to speak of we are at a turning point as a species and we must collectively choose either failure or success making sustainable living choices as an individual is a step in the right direction but these choices can only go so far when the broader mindset is one of apathy and indifference the beginning of this long road starts with informing the people around you that there is a better alternative to the way the world works but this better alternative will never be realized if we cannot work together to change the status quo of our culture as more and more people become aware of the state of dysfunction our current society is in more and more people will have a thirst and desire for real comprehensive change for the better eventually as more people are awakened it is possible that world governments and not just individuals would want to sign on to the idea of the global collective when this happens an interim federation of countries that agree with the ideals of the global collective can be formed as momentum continues to grow and a majority of countries join the federation the realization of our goal is within sight once every country signs on and joins the federation the federation will cease to exist and the global collective will be realized x b the ideas set forth in this document are in no way intended to rob people of their individuality they are instead a means to level the playing field from which people begin individuals in the global collective will not define themselves by the amount of money they have the kind of car they drive or by the size of their home our citizens will be defined by the contributions they make to our society by the original thoughts they share with others and by the positive effect they have on the world around them every person in the global collective will be encouraged to realize their full potential furthermore within the global collective dishonesty subversion and manipulation will not be seen as means toward obtaining an end a broad shift in societal mindset is required this can only be achieved with collective solidarity applied over the course of several decades the end goal is the realization that your own well being is not above and beyond the well being of others and that the well being of our planet in its entirety is a necessity you are a part of a greater whole with a greater purpose if the greater whole realizes its full potential then all parts within that whole will realize their full potential x b the framework put forth in this document is far from perfect but it is a significant step in the right direction eventually this will be more than just a list of ideas on a piece of paper it will be a way of life the greatest requirement is the ability to act if the propositions in this document resonate with you i implore you to take some degree of action to help me expand this message at the very least take the time to discuss these ideas with a friend to be more involved take pictures of this paper and share them with others or make photo copies of this paper and pass them out to others if you desire change do not fail to act make the world a better place to the best of your own ability the positivity you put out will return to you in one form or another x b this document is overtly encouraging a revolution but such revolution can by no means be achieved through the use of violence violence is contrary to the ideals of the global collective any revolution involving violence would only lead to a continued repetition of past mistakes we require a revolution to end all revolutions we require a revolution to destroy the idea of social class our revolution can only be achieved through non violent non compliance the best way to stop the system that is currently in place is by refusing to participate we must collectively refuse to be a part of the endless cycle of consumption the cycle of consumption only benefits those at the top and we need a system that equally provides for all citizens we will make our voices heard human beings are much more than cogs in a machine that exists only to reap vast profits from both the subjugation of the down trodden and the rape of our mother earth if all the small cogs of that machine collectively refuse to turn the entire mechanism will come to a grinding halt and at this point there is no other option our biosphere is rapidly approaching a level of damage from which it will be unable to rebound it is fundamental to realize that all parts of our planet are interconnected we all come from and return to our biosphere and willful destruction of that biosphere is literal suicide we the silent majority that will no longer remain silent choose life instead of death we choose integrity and truth as opposed to dishonesty and subversion we choose to invest in our future rather than to stagnate in our past we choose to go forward hand in hand side by side instead of using the backs of others as stepping stones to the top we choose an existence of substance meaning and value as opposed to one of mediocrity repetition and squandered potential but most important of all we choose to do it together and not alone x b my name is nicholas kolozvary and i am the author of the text contained in this document in order for these goals to be realized a great degree of both networking and feedback are required please reach out to those around you and discuss the best means of actualizing comprehensive change whether or not you

best among your audience you re going to need to experiment that means ramping up your content production and posting more frequently publishing to instagram at least once a day is within the platform s best practices heck major brands like topshop and h m post up to three times per day if not more often as you roll out more content it s crucial to squeeze more engagement out of your following by understanding the best times to post on instagram the best times to post on instagram according to sprout social publishing a photo every once in a while isn t going to cut it if you want to stay fresh in your followers feeds and speaking of which that s also why instagram stories marketingunitech com are so valuable off the cuff content via stories essentially allows you to skip the line and appear front and center in people s feeds not only that but you can freely post snap after snap without worrying about spamming your fans the takeaway here is that instagram moves much quicker than it did a year or two ago in terms of content brands should ramp up if they want to keep up cross promote your instagram posts across other networks the effort it takes to snag the perfect snapshot and craft a clever caption isn t something that should go to waste cross posting your content to other social platforms is a no brainer to get even more of an roi out of your instagram presence for example you can promote your instagram content across the likes of facebook and twitter to maximize your content s reach although cross promotion is a smart move bear in mind that each social platform has its own best practices for example instagram tends to go heavier on the hashtags while you might want to craft a slightly different description for images posted to facebook sound time consuming

optimal send times simplifies things further by scheduling content to post at the times most likely to generate engagement from your audience focus on people centric content although instagram is a place to score sales it is still first and foremost a place to share experiences the popularity of selfies on instagram speaks for itself as does customer photos and pictures of people using products in real world settings much of the appeal of instagram is that brands are capable of advertising in a more human way without bombarding followers with messages that scream buy now and on a related note this is exactly why user generated content such as customer photos are such a goldmine for brands not only do folks on the gram love it when brands shout them out but customer photos represent marketing firepower that proves that people dig your products but in order to spot and curate user generated content for your feed you re going to need to understand how hashtags can help you promote your instagram and that leads us to our next point experiment with branded and industry hashtags brands both big and small should create a hashtag to encourage sharing and promotion on behalf of their followers doing so doesn t have to be rocket science either for example ernie ball displays their iplayslinky and colorsofrocknroll hashtags loud and clear in their bio including a branded hashtag in your bio is the first step to allowing followers to promote your instagram in turn they use the tag to promote their own posts in addition to thousands of loyal fans promoting the brand organically through branded hashtag marketingunitech com you can encourage followers to promote your instagram for you see how that works beyond your own hashtags you should try to promote your instagram using more general community hashtags specific to your industry such as strings music or unicornhair beauty tacking on extra tags essentially makes your posts searchable by tag followers and instantly increases your reach as noted in our guide detailing how to use hashtags across every social network engagement peaks at approximately nine hashtags although you can certainly use less or more the takeaway here is that you should at the very least add something including hashtags on your instagram content automatically increases engagement don t forget to take advantage of hashtag analytics tools sprout lets you track and analyze hashtag performance to find out what s resonating with audiences and optimize usage and with sprout s advanced listening you can move beyond quantitative data to find qualitative insights related to hashtags allowing you to fully understand campaign performance and measure share of voice additionally you can identify related hashtags to dive deeper into the brand relevant conversations consumers are having on social tag brands followers and locations whenever you can tagging is a surprisingly effective way to promote your instagram and no we re not just talking about hashtags for example you can tag other brands and accounts in hopes of a shout out yourself given that notifications ping anyone who receives them relevant tags are a subtle way to encourage promotion likewise it s both courtesy and within instagram s best practices to tag anyone you might be regramming chances are they ll be thrilled to be featured in your feed and will share the news with their own followers don t forget to tag locations too for example if you have a physical location for your business or regularly attends events location specific posts allow you to explore new potential fans and followers location tagging is essential to location instagram promotion marketingunitech com publish instagram content on site when it comes to ads what better billboards than your own customers featuring instagram content on site is a brilliant way to increase conversions why because when people see purchased products in real world settings they know that the brand in question has satisfied customers consumers can better visualize and understand a product for themselves when they see it in the wild thus the rise of lookbooks and brands featuring user generated content on product pages for example casper uses an instagram slideshow on site to show off their satisfied sleepers of course this all circles back to the need to promote your instagram hashtag in addition to their instagram bio topshopstyle is plastered across the brand s site and marketing emails to increase their tag s exposure the end result is more user generated content and people promoting topshop organically promoting your hashtag on site goes hand in hand with instagram promotion marketingunitech com carve out your creative trademark creativity counts on instagram having some sort of niche or theme is a great way to both inspire your instagram content and make yourself stand out from the crowd for example yeti is known for its feed full of high res photos of the outdoors featuring adventures enjoying their products yeti s creative trademark on instagram is high quality photos of landscapes meanwhile overtone boasts a bold color coded feed based on whichever shade of their product their currently promoting overtone s creative trademark on instagram is their use of color if you re stumped as to what your creative trademark should be don t sweat it there are tons of instagram apps such as vsco which can help you add some creative flair to your photos by using consistent gradients colors and filters you can make your feed feel more well you work with influencers to extend your reach as we mentioned earlier instagram benefits from being a platform where brands can essentially publish ads without shoving them in their followers faces enter the rise of influencer marketing simply put influencer marketing entails a paid relationship with another instagram account with a sizeable engaged follower count influencers audiences should ideally mirror your own or allow you to tap into a new sect of users that you re trying to reach influencers are akin to ads in the sense that the relationship does indeed cost money however finding the right influencer can be an incredibly cost effective way to both sell products and grow your following brands can spot influencers through hashtags and manual searching or you can try instagram analytics tools such as tapinfluence or search an in depth database related to your business tapinfluence s directory makes it easy to hone in on potential influencers who could help promote your instagram presence marketingunitech com remember when identifying influencers just make sure they have a following that actually engages with their content engagement rate calculators such as this one from phlanx can help give you peace of mind about any influencers in question engagement rate is a crucial metric when looking for an influencer to help promote your instagram rethink how you present your products and promotions this is a simple tip but is definitely something worth mentioning and it relates to that other kind of instagram promotion the one with fun giveaways or sale items and can be incredibly valuable for your brand when done well so when you promote your instagram in these instances it s crucial to present your content as must see instagram thrives on anything and everything new anything you can do to create a sense of hype is a major point in your favor for example check out how glossier hypes up their much requested eye cream by surprising their followers a day before it drops uniqlo publishes hype heavy instagram promotions and content including calls to action for followers to check out their exclusive merch pinup girl also does a great job of highlighting why their products rock and allows their brand voice to shine through in the process as a rule of thumb think so what before you hit publish for your promotions on instagram doing so will ultimately encourage you to write more compelling captions run a contest or giveaway here s some food for thought brands that run contests grow their followings faster than those that don t you might notice that many brands contest and giveaway related posts receive insane amounts of engagement and that s no accident done correctly social media contests can result in followers and fans although they can also attract freebie chasers we recommend running a one time contest promotion on instagram to test the waters and determine whether or not contests are something you want to try for the long term optimize

       " 'what is big data big data is characterized as the data that can not be prepared by customary methods and systems because of its large size and complexity the word big in big data means petabytes or exabytes of data it is calculated that nearly of the data that we have today has been generated in the last two years this implies exponential growth in data volume is going to proceed this growth will increase further with the increase in iot internet of things data analytics mainly uses big data it gives necessary insights into business operations of any business it helps businesses in growth competitiveness and profitability need of big data there are many challenges for handling a huge data in applications big data is no longer growing trend this is now time tested accepted with a sound secure stable architecture it is synchronized with information generating efficient analytics by organizations ranging from data oriented start ups to big technology giants around the globe there are many tools on the internet there is considerably more to it than big data alone if you hold a large amount of various data and from this you need to find out answers at fast you may look at the opening gates called the three v s of the data this means that you are ready to look at better solutions that fulfils your need of data can you say that it is enough of course not do you want to turn your existing application asset to a bigger store for a theoretically possible performance how big are your existing data security issues and how would you deal with the same on the new infrastructure is your data big enough for these solutions such questions carry you to a point where you have to think about a couple of significant things you realize that first the idea of building an efficient big data infrastructure lies the need to build a decision on whether to present a big data infrastructure or not why you should need big data in an organization organizations or businesses requires a big data services to allow them to survive in a fast growing and increasingly competitive market where the sources and the requirements to store data are growing at exponential manner to handle high volumes the data storage should be elastic and scalable cloud based storage is a better idea for most businesses because it reduces investments there are no physical systems on site means that it saves space and power consumption it handles the data security issues you require tools to enable virtualization and carry out data compression you should require object based storage architecture to handle a large amount of files organizations are looking out for the solution that can store complex unstructured data and which do not have predefined schemas big data solutions do not force a schema onto the stored data instead you can store any type of structured semi structured or unstructured data and then apply a suitable schema when you query this data big data solutions store data in raw format and apply a schema only when the data is read this preserves all information within the data this is contradictory to the way of traditional database data magnitude determination in the first documented use of the term big data appeared in paper by scientists at nasa it describes the problem facing by them with visualization generally data sets are large taxing the capacities of main memory local disk and remote disk this problem is big data when there is a situation like data sets don t fit in main memory or when they do not fit on local disk also in such cases the solution is to acquire more resources another most important factor is what you want to do with the data the problem is big data solutions is that they are numerous getting the perfect tool is important for the cost efficiency and delivery constraints also creating an understanding of these factors is a main requirement of big data infrastructure requirements necessity of advanced analytics an interesting thing that gives thought on analytics is one of the financial services firm which turned to big data to better identify which new client opportunities warrant the most investment the organization enhanced its client statistic information with third party data purchased from ebureau the data service provider appended sales lead opportunities with buyer s occupation earnings age retail histories and also related factors the advanced data set is then applied to an algorithm this identifies which new client leads should receive additional investment and which should not the result has been hike in new client win rates at the similar instance the firm has lowered sales related expenses by there are some benefits that big data analytics offer are getting answers to complex business problems creating cost effective requirements to bring in more customers analyzing existing values to predict faster and better business decisions and also exploiting machine learning analytics to make self learning systems right time for data transition and security issues data driven transition must start with your business goals and also objectives as you understand your business objectives then you are ready to create a roadmap for leveraging new data sources to help you achieve them also technology is not only enough to transform your organization into a data driven organization creating a platform that understands data securing the data and how to use it is just as necessary the challenge of detecting and also preventing advanced persistent threats has bought the importance of security responsibilities in light deciding the need of a big data infrastructure',\n",

it has been for days the afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn t too thick for the sun to get through today was degrees celsius the winds have picked up the firefighters have been at it for over a month over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt there isn t much green left on our map huge portions of it are now soot black you look at where the fires are and the markers of them on the map overlap like you re looking at a field of wildflowers in blue yellow and red people have lost their lives people have lost their homes the

there are parts of nsw where the dams are empty truly empty dust fields that are massive nothing able to grow in these conditions the sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again loud and multiple as i try to get to sleep people who have it worse than my cat and can t breathe i drive home and see firetrucks up by people s houses i pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do it s two weeks to christmas and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun places i ve been places i know well sit facing fires approaching them from all sides i wish you all the luck in the world is what i can say to those i know facing it and what i get back is we will stand and defend our home these aren t small fires that burn out in days these are firegrounds larger than sydney itself that have been burning for weeks the hot air rises from them along with the ash and it meets the damp winds off the ocean the result is a thunderstorm you d think rain would put these fires out it does not the ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing the fires keep raging even as water unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it floods away from them we get floods on top of fires sooty water running away from a blaze that won t stop blazing these thunderstorms are unlike any i have ever seen before people say thunderstorms bring a false twilight this is a very late twilight nautical twilight perhaps early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting and it s a while yet before the rain falls though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones you just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn t happen nearby because these thunderstorms start new fires they put nothing out while at the same time bring more fire more destruction i ve sat on tenterhooks waiting to hear whether i m needed to help evacuate people i ve watched places i know well go up in smoke i ve waded through that smoke haze feeling like i have a constant burgeoning cold trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place i live where my loved ones live is to be short lived and then there are the arsonists i m at a point where i d wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires more water that we don t have spent on

just some of the global problems food production contributes to but when we buy our food we aren t given any information about whether a product is bad for the environment or not food packaging in the uk has nutritional information www nhs uk live well eat well how to read food labels printed on it to help consumers make healthier choices why not also have sustainability information so it s easier to make eco friendly choices too there are many factors that affect how sustainable a food product is meaning there are a variety of ways you could present this information to consumers from only focusing on one element such as a product s carbon footprint to a detailed breakdown of every way the environment is affected during a product s life cycle to give an idea of how food sustainability

shipping of a food product percentage of daily emissions limit each person should have a daily carbon footprint target or allowance much like the daily reference intakes displayed on food nutrition

variations i redd it zsbqdccxyi jpg this design would combine a variety of different food sustainability factors and condense them into a very simple explanation of whether a product is sustainable or

system while it is a lot of information for consumers to digest it would allow consumers to make well informed choices about what food they eat sustainable daily consumption quota this is a guideline limit to how much one person can sustainably consume on a daily basis each resource shown carbon footprint water usage etc would have an independent percentage relative to what our planet can sustain

endeavour not only would the life cycle of a product need to be rigorously researched but the proven sustainability of a product would have to be heavily policed an independent body would be required to refine and govern such a scheme as it is unlikely that food manufacturers could be trusted to do it themselves some may say that sustainability labelling is too complex and laborious to introduce but the fact is there are numerous independent studies science sciencemag org content full that detail how sustainable different types of food are the information is available which means that sustainability labelling is possible if consumers are being expected to make more environmentally conscious food choices it is only fair that we are given clear information on food packaging that helps us do this without government oversight and participation sustainability labelling is unlikely to be implemented so pressure from voters is needed to get governments to act if you agree that the introduction of a sustainability labelling system would be a benefit to consumers show your support by signing one of the petitions i have created there is a uk petition and an eu petition if neither

       " 'million  the number of homes solar panels were able to power in the us at the end of       whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future  solar energy is almost always brought alight  solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world  as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe  behind solar energy are solar panels  the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs  ever since       solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for      clean  renewable energy  the talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount  but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels  how they work  and their current day status     solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization  but it wasn t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun s energy  it wasn t until the     s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system  solar energy all started based off an earth shattering      discovery found by french physicist  edmond becquerel  this discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect   a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight   as energy education puts it  additionally  the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution  consequently  becquerel would exclaim   shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current   in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect  later  in       willoughby smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium  now used in solar panels today  moreover  in       william grylls adams and richard evans day put the photovoltaic idea  originally found by becquerel  to selenium  finding it could generate electricity when light hit it  to no one s surprise  someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in       when charles fritts created the first ever working selenium cell  charles fritts  newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time  as he hoped it would compete with edison s coal fired power plants  on the contrary  the new  innovative selenium cell was less than    efficient and had no chance of competing with edison s coal fired power plants as the solar cell wasn t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives  generally  the idea of solar energy wasn t a popular one at the time and wouldn t be for a while  eventually  the concept of solar energy was brought alight when albert einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy  happening in       hence  albert einstein would win the nobel prize in physics        for his services to theoretical physics  and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect   he would receive the prize a year later  in          with the concept of solar energy gaining steam  more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect  it wasn t until      when russell ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell  different than the selenium cell invented by charles fritts in       similarly  like fritts  selenium cell  the new solar cell invented by russell ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time  the energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only     thus for every     joules of solar energy hitting the cell  only   joule of electrical energy was created  while this was an improvement from fritts  cell  it wasn t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide  as previously mentioned  the most groundbreaking  substantial invention didn t come until       when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by daryl chapin  calvin fuller  and gerald pearson  after months of long  grueling work  the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented  originally  daryl chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas  therefore turning to solar energy as the option  he would later collaborate with calvin fuller and gerald pearson  as they all invented the cell in unity  truly  this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a    conversion efficiency  much more than the      solar cell invented by russell ohl or the      selenium cell invented by charles fritts  in fact  the solar call had so much potential the new york times wrote the newly invented silicon cell   may mark the beginning of a new era  leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind s most cherished dreams the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization   even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies  the solar cells costed over      per watt   the us military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the     s  the funding persited  and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the vanguard i in       for some time  solar was still too costly for use until dr  elliot berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell  bringing the cost per watt down to just      in the early     s  coincidentally  in       the energy crisis hit the us which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the us to turn to other energy options  like solar  in turn  this made the us government committed to developing solar energy  solar panels in specific  as a feasible source of energy for future uses  as a result  jimmy carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the white house to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement  evidently  solar panels started to become more feasible as the  golden era  of solar panels for the     s hit in the     s     during the     s  solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments  by the     s  many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth  for example  in       the university of south florida developed a       efficient thin film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride  just a short time after  in       the first ever solar cell exceeding     conversion efficiency was made    years later  in       a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted       of the sunlight that hits it into electricity  also in        the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin film solar cells was hit marking in at        in total  growth between the     s and     s was crucial to solar panels expanding  just in       the worldwide photovoltaic production was      megawatts  in       that number increased to       megawatts  in conclusion  it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed     today  solar panels work in a very specific way  for solar panels to work  sunlight must be hitting the panel  obviously  if there is no sun  the solar panels won t be working at that specific moment  this is why at night  solar panels aren t working like they are in the day  anyway  soon after the sun hits the panel  the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun  for the sun to hit the cell  it must go through the frame  glass  and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel  once the sun does hit the cell  after passing through the first stages of the solar panel  electrons begin to move around internally  nevertheless  a solar cell consists of a layer of p type silicon placed next to a layer of n type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers  inside the n type  there is an excess of electrons while inside the p type  there is an excess of positively charged holes  between the n type silicon layer and the p type silicon layer  there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes  once this is completed  the p type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n type consists of positively charged ions  moreover  this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n type layer to fill the holes in the p type layer  finally  when sunlight hits the cell  electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes  all in all  when the p type and n type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current  the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity  in a residential solar makeup  the solar panels convert the sunlight into dc energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to ac for use  for all energy not needed  it goes back to the grid  in conclusion  solar panels aren t too complicated and work following a basic method  without the method present  solar panels wouldn t be able to function as they do     in today s era  solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years  in the last decade alone  solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of     amongst the us  furthermore  there are currently over         americans working in the solar industry with over        companies per state  in discussion with cost  the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than     in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from       to       now  comparing the prices to    years ago  there is a huge difference in cost  currently  most solar is installed in europe and east asia which account for over     of global installations  the least happens to be in africa  accounting for less than    of total global installations  installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in       in       there were no installations of solar in the us whatsoever  by       the yearly installation reached almost        watts across residential pv  photovoltaic   non residential pv  utility pv  and utility csp  the us has also been emphasizing solar  with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since       in       that number was just     in       it was     out of all possible energies  nevertheless  in the us  california has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from california  in fact  california beats the next   states combined in terms of annual residential pv installations  by january  st        california is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels  in terms of efficiency  most solar panels have above     conversion levels now  there are actually   different types of solar panels  with different types varying per company  finally  solar panels can be found in solar farms  on residential homes  and commercial homes primarily  it is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way  to illustrate how solar is truly on the rise  the global solar energy sector is projected to reach      billion by      up from     billion in       according to allied market research  in conclusion  it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future  within    years  solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past        clearly  the history of solar panels is quite eventful  the way they work is very fascinating and complex  and their current day status is very promising  without solar panels in life  the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around  not only this  renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day  less promising options like wind energy  jobs would also be lost  the economy wouldn t be the same  and solar companies would seize to exist  in a world without solar panels  what would it be like    i hope you enjoyed the essay i wrote  please feel free to comment any thoughts you may have a deep dive into solar panel',\n",

the scientific method so that they will remain objective throughout the process    b  problems will be analyzed as they arise  the root cause of dilemmas will be diagnosed when possible   when the root cause of a problem can be determined  the solution should come from addressing the problem at its source  as opposed to addressing the symptoms caused by the problem   c  groups of people will be

integration and dynamic feedback  a  groups of people will be encouraged to participate in recreational activities  these recreational activities  will promote both the release of stress and the

equality   amp  x   b    class differentiation has existed since the foundation of civilization  consequently  it is hard to imagine a world in which it does not exist  but  our society is rapidly transitioning out of the industrial age and into the technological age  if we are able to effectively phase into the technological age  the creation of a utopia becomes a realistic possibility  as technology continuously improves  eventually scarcity will become an outdated convention  in a world where scarcity is no longer an issue  goods are produced in enough abundance to be freely available  if goods are freely available and have no cost assigned to them  the means of class differentiation disappear     in order for society to move past classism  society must also move past the definition of oneself by their material possessions  the importance our current society places on possessions is a product of consumer culture  moving past the dependence on ownership of objects is essential to the maintenance of social equality  admittedly  there are a lot of nice  luxurious things in the world  but  the bond a person has with an inanimate object can never come close to the comradery of life long friendship  real world connections with others are what truly matters  furthermore  a greater quality of life can be achieved by devoting one s time to pursuing passions  this will create a greater degree of fulfillment than spending one s life pursuing status symbols    the profit mechanism is the root cause of the majority of the problems our society faces today  not only is it the source of the chasm between the upper and lower classes  but it is the cause of extensive harm to our environment  some people would argue that competition for the sake of profit encourages innovation  but competition in the context of profit is counterproductive  because competing parties are only striving to be marginally better than their rivals  if a company were to make a significantly superior product than their competitors  then they may spend too much to produce it and not turn a profit  furthermore  a vastly superior product that doesn t become obsolete within a few years would put the producer out of business  planned obsolescence goes hand in with cyclical consumption  and cyclical consumption goes hand in hand with unnecessary waste of resources  and lastly  the profit mechanism encourages harm to the environment  this is the case because practices and policies that have the least impact on the environment are often the most expensive  if a company can make more money by sacrificing the wellbeing of the environment  they will do so  the profit mechanism must not exist in a world that is to remain viable for human life    many individuals find the root of their identity in their nationality  by no means is culture a crime  but at times national prejudices serve as a wedge that drives groups of people apart  without the existence of nations  the separation of peoples into competing factions becomes more difficult  and the creation of collective cooperation at a societal level becomes more realistic    religion  and the devotion to one s personal god  is a very sensitive issue  but the fact that preference of one benevolent deity or another can oftentimes inspire deep seated hatred between groups of people  is concerning and unsettling  my hope for the future  as should be yours  is that people are able to look past their differences and put more emphasis on their similarities  by doing this  we will actually be adhering to the golden rule instead of deviating from it    amp  x   b   on improving the quality of human life   amp  x   b    in the global collective  education will be the most fundamental part of our society  currently  education is primarily geared towards preparing people to enter the work force  this means that all the resources and energy of educational institutions are spent grooming students to be active participants in an endless cycle of consumption  learning solely for the sake of knowledge is a practice that is almost completely extinct in today s world  the majority of people see knowledge or college diplomas as a means to an end  the end of having a good job and enough money to be happy  but this pursuit is a fallacy  true happiness can be found in the pursuit of knowledge and engaging in logical discourse with those around you  in the global collective  exchange of information and ideas is essential to the continuous improvement of our citizens    in the same theme of not defining oneself by their possessions  people will also not be defined by the luxury of the house in which they live  housing situations will be both practical and pragmatic  never lavish or excessive  people will have the choice of living alone  in communes  or with family members     the major emphasis of healthcare will be on prevention as opposed to reaction  a high degree of diseases and conditions that arise in today s healthcare systems are easily preventable if there were more proactive measures in place  as well as a better mindset about health  a new healthcare system with a holistic approach to health and medicine will work best for both the providers and recipients of care     many people would argue that violence is an inescapable part of human nature  but i would have to disagree with this assertion  the only reason human civilization has progressed this far and become this advanced  is our ability to work cooperatively  there is still a lot of room for our improvement  and this improvement could be more easily accomplished if the broader societal mindset placed less emphasis on individuality and more emphasis on collectivity    the setting and realization of goals  as well as the expression of thoughts and ideas  are essential parts of leading a fulfilling life  not only are these activities fulfilling  but they can be therapeutic as well  active engagement with the people around us and the world around us will help to combat the recurring dysfunction that we see in the world today    amp  x   b    amp  x   b   concluding remarks and hopes for our future   amp  x   b    transforming our culture from one of excessive waste into one that is sustainable into the future will be a long and arduous process  but  it is a process that must be undertaken if we want to have a future to speak of  we are at a turning point as a species  and we must collectively choose either failure or success  making sustainable living choices as an individual is a step in the right direction  but these choices can only go so far when the broader mindset is one of apathy and indifference  the beginning of this long road starts with informing the people around you that there is a better alternative to the way the world works  but this better alternative will never be realized if we cannot work together to change the status quo of our culture  as more and more people become aware of the state of dysfunction our current society is in  more and more people will have a thirst and desire for real  comprehensive change for the better  eventually  as more people are awakened  it is possible that world governments  and not just individuals  would want to sign on to the idea of the global collective  when this happens  an interim federation of countries that agree with the ideals of the global collective can be formed  as momentum continues to grow  and a majority of countries join the federation  the realization of our goal is within sight  once every country signs on and joins the federation  the federation will cease to exist and the global collective will be realized    amp  x   b    the ideas set forth in this document are in no way intended to rob people of their individuality  they are instead a means to level the playing field from which people begin  individuals in the global collective will not define themselves by the amount of money they have  the kind of car they drive or by the size of their home  our citizens will be defined by the contributions they make to our society  by the original thoughts they share with others and by the positive effect they have on the world around them  every person in the global collective will be encouraged to realize their full potential  furthermore  within the global collective  dishonesty subversion and manipulation will not be seen as means toward obtaining an end  a broad shift in societal mindset is required  this can only be achieved with collective solidarity applied over the course of several decades  the end goal is the realization that your own well being is not above and beyond the well being of others  and that the well being of our planet in its entirety is a necessity  you are a part of a greater whole  with a greater purpose  if the greater whole realizes its full potential  then all parts within that whole will realize their full potential     amp  x   b    the framework put forth in this document is far from perfect  but it is a significant step in the right direction  eventually  this will be more than just a list of ideas on a piece of paper  it will be a way of life  the greatest requirement is the ability to act  if the propositions in this document resonate with you  i implore you to take some degree of action to help me expand this message  at the very least  take the time to discuss these ideas with a friend  to be more involved  take pictures of this paper and share them with others or make photo copies of this paper and pass them out to others  if you desire change  do not fail to act  make the world a better place to the best of your own ability  the positivity you put out will return to you in one form or another    amp  x   b    this document is overtly encouraging a revolution  but  such revolution can by no means be achieved through the use of violence  violence is contrary to the ideals of the global collective  any revolution involving violence would only lead to a continued repetition of past mistakes  we require a revolution to end all revolutions  we require a revolution to destroy the idea of social class  our revolution can only be achieved through non violent non compliance  the best way to stop the system that is currently in place is by refusing to participate  we must collectively refuse to be a part of the endless cycle of consumption  the cycle of consumption only benefits those at the top  and we need a system that equally provides for all citizens  we will make our voices heard  human beings are much more than cogs in a machine that exists only to reap vast profits from both the subjugation of the down trodden and the rape of our mother earth  if all the small cogs of that machine collectively refuse to turn  the entire mechanism will come to a grinding halt  and  at this point  there is no other option  our biosphere is rapidly approaching a level of damage from which it will be unable to rebound  it is fundamental to realize that all parts of our planet are interconnected  we all come from and return to our biosphere  and willful destruction of that biosphere is literal suicide  we  the silent majority that will no longer remain silent  choose life instead of death  we choose integrity and truth as opposed to dishonesty and subversion  we choose to invest in our future rather than to stagnate in our past  we choose to go forward hand in hand  side by side  instead of using the backs of others as stepping stones to the top  we choose an existence of substance  meaning and value as opposed to one of mediocrity  repetition and squandered potential  but  most important of all  we choose to do it together and not alone    amp  x   b

   of total mobile traffic globally  which suggests that in the next few years  technology could advance at a rapid rate  with its advanced data analytics and enhanced network edge capabilities   g technology is likely to create a broad range of opportunities for innovative companies and this could take technology to the next level      advanced technology      while some exciting applications of  g technology such as self driving cars are still a few years away  a number of innovative connected devices are already hitting the market  one example is the coolpad dyno smartwatch   a state of the art smartwatch designed for children  this watch is different from your regular smartwatch due to the fact it has features that can help keep parents connected to their children  for example  with this watch  parents can track their children s location at all times  and set  safe zones  with virtual perimeter alerts  if the child goes outside the safe zone  parents will receive an alert  the watch also has an sos button on the side that children can use to call emergency contacts or      as technology continues to advance in the years ahead  we are likely to see plenty more unique products like this      product launch challenges     however  for the companies that are designing and manufacturing new electronic products  the launch process is not always easy  seamless connectivity is required  yet there are hundreds of different network carriers across the world and each has its own complex it architecture  this adds complications because electronics manufacturers often do not fully understand how to integrate their technology with each network  furthermore  manufacturers need to ensure that their products are fully compliant with all security standards and regulations  add in the negotiation of trade tariffs  and the challenges associated with providing international customer support  and it s easy to see why the launch of a new product can be a challenging experience       platform solutions    there is one easy solution to the challenges associated with product launches  however  and that is using an integrated service enablement platform  these platforms provide a range of connectivity services between manufacturers  retailers  and consumers which makes the process of launching a new product far more streamlined    the main benefit of using an integrated service enablement platform is that they provide a framework for carrier network and third party integration  which makes it easier to scale up product launches  for example  a platform will provide manufacturers with connectivity partnerships  including distribution channels and price structures  with major telecommunication networks such as vodafone  verizon  and orange  because all of the infrastructure is already in place  manufacturers can get new products up and running in a matter of days  platforms can also secure attractive wholesale rates from network partners that can then be passed on to manufacturers    in addition  an integrated service enablement platform will provide a range of valuable services including device management  customer support  and technical support  operating within international telecommunications and payments systems frameworks  they can also help connected smart devices manage billing and payments subscriptions  by using one software platform  control panel  and set of integration tools  the process of launching a new product becomes far less complicated       g is the key     in the years ahead  technology is likely to take the world into uncharted territory  from self driving cars to robotics  the applications of iot are limitless  however  the key to success is seamless connectivity  that s why the rollout of  g technology   which offers super fast speeds and reliable connections   is such a big deal        by francis menassa  founder of jar capital  an independent wealth and asset management firm based in st  james s  london francis menassa  jar capital    g will take technology to the next level',\n",

sort of engagement today   based on recent instagram stats  the visual space is becoming more and more crowded with brands fighting tooth and nail for more customers   as a result  it quite literally pays to have as many tactics as possible to promote instagram to your target audience   in this guide  we ve broken down    totally actionable ways to do exactly that  from optimizing your posts and profile to rethinking your approach to content promotion  any combination of these tips are fair game when it comes to instagram promotion      ramp up your content production  there s no shortage of  instagram content     marketingunitech com  you can publish to fill up your feed   customer photos  memes  bite sized videos   and that doesn t even scratch the surface of what s available to you   to figure out what performs the best among your audience  you re going to need to experiment  that means ramping up your content production and posting more frequently   publishing to instagram at least once a day is within the platform s best practices  heck  major brands like topshop and h amp m post up to three times per day  if not more often    as you roll out more content  it s crucial to squeeze more engagement out of your following by understanding the best times to post on instagram   the best times to post on instagram according to sprout social  publishing a photo every once in a while isn t going to cut it if you want to stay fresh in your followers  feeds   and speaking of which  that s also why  instagram stories     marketingunitech com  are so valuable  off the cuff content via stories essentially allows you to  skip the line  and appear front and center in people s feeds  not only that  but you can freely post snap after snap without worrying about spamming your fans   the takeaway here is that instagram moves much quicker than it did a year or two ago in terms of content  brands should ramp up if they want to keep up      cross promote your instagram posts across other networks  the effort it takes to snag the perfect snapshot and craft a clever caption isn t something that should go to waste   cross posting your content to other social platforms is a no brainer to get even more of an roi out of your instagram presence   for example  you can promote your instagram content across the likes of facebook and twitter to maximize your content s reach   although cross promotion is a smart move  bear in mind that each social platform has its own best practices  for example  instagram tends to go heavier on the hashtags while you might want to craft a slightly different description for images posted to facebook   sound time consuming  it doesn t have to be   sprout social s asset library enables you to store images  videos and text in a centralized location for use across multiple social networks  quickly find  edit and publish directly from the asset library to deliver engaging posts that are tailored to whatever network you re using   having an asset library handy allows you to upload all of your social creatives in one place  and don t forget to make your job even easier by using scheduling and publishing tools   features such as sprout s viralpost ensure that your promote instagram content at the right times for engagement  sprout s optimal send times simplifies things further by scheduling content to post at the times most likely to generate engagement from your audience      focus on people centric content  although instagram is a place to score sales  it is still first and foremost a place to share experiences   the popularity of selfies on instagram speaks for itself  as does customer photos and pictures of people using products in real world settings  much of the appeal of instagram is that brands are capable of advertising in a more human way without bombarding followers with messages that scream  buy now    and on a related note  this is exactly why user generated content such as customer photos are such a goldmine for brands  not only do folks on the  gram love it when brands shout them out  but customer photos represent marketing firepower that proves that people dig your products   but in order to spot and curate user generated content for your feed  you re going to need to understand how hashtags can help you promote your instagram   and that leads us to our next point      experiment with branded and industry hashtags  brands both big and small should create a hashtag to encourage sharing and promotion on behalf of their followers  doing so doesn t have to be rocket science  either   for example  ernie ball displays their  iplayslinky and  colorsofrocknroll hashtags loud and clear in their bio   including a branded hashtag in your bio is the first step to allowing followers to promote your instagram  in turn  they use the tag to promote their own posts in addition to thousands of loyal fans promoting the brand organically   through branded hashtag     marketingunitech com   you can encourage followers to promote your instagram for you  see how that works   beyond your own hashtags  you should try to promote your instagram using more general  community hashtags specific to your industry such as   strings  music  or  unicornhair  beauty   tacking on extra tags essentially makes your posts searchable by tag followers and instantly increases your reach   as noted in our guide detailing how to use hashtags across every social network  engagement peaks at approximately nine hashtags  although you can certainly use less  or more   the takeaway here is that you should at the very least add something   including hashtags on your instagram content automatically increases engagement  don t forget to take advantage of hashtag analytics tools  sprout lets you track and analyze hashtag performance to find out what s resonating with audiences and optimize usage   and with sprout s advanced listening  you can move beyond quantitative data to find qualitative insights related to hashtags  allowing you to fully understand campaign performance and measure share of voice  additionally  you can identify related hashtags to dive deeper into the brand relevant conversations consumers are having on social      tag brands  followers and locations whenever you can  tagging is a surprisingly effective way to promote your instagram   and no  we re not just talking about hashtags   for example  you can tag other brands and accounts in hopes of a shout out yourself  given that notifications ping anyone who receives them  relevant tags are a subtle way to encourage promotion   likewise  it s both courtesy and within instagram s best practices to tag anyone you might be regramming  chances are they ll be thrilled to be featured in your feed and will share the news with their own followers   don t forget to tag locations  too  for example  if you have a physical location for your business or regularly attends events  location specific posts allow you to explore new potential fans and followers   location tagging is essential to location  instagram promotion     marketingunitech com      publish instagram content on site  when it comes to ads  what better billboards than your own customers   featuring instagram content on site is a brilliant way to increase conversions  why  because when people see purchased products in real world settings  they know that the brand in question has satisfied customers  consumers can better visualize and understand a product for themselves when they see it  in the wild    thus the rise of lookbooks and brands featuring user generated content on product pages  for example  casper uses an instagram slideshow on site to show off their satisfied sleepers   of course  this all circles back to the need to promote your instagram hashtag   in addition to their instagram bio   topshopstyle is plastered across the brand s site and marketing emails to increase their tag s exposure  the end result is more user generated content and people promoting topshop organically   promoting your hashtag on site goes hand in hand with  instagram promotion     marketingunitech com       carve out your creative trademark  creativity counts on instagram   having some sort of niche or theme is a great way to both inspire your instagram content and make yourself stand out from the crowd   for example  yeti is known for its feed full of high res photos of the outdoors featuring adventures enjoying their products   yeti s creative trademark on instagram is high quality photos of landscapes  meanwhile  overtone boasts a bold color coded feed based on whichever shade of their product their currently promoting   overtone s creative trademark on instagram is their use of color  if you re stumped as to what your creative trademark should be  don t sweat it  there are tons of instagram apps  such as vsco  which can help you add some creative flair to your photos  by using consistent gradients  colors and filters  you can make your feed feel more  well  you      work with influencers to extend your reach  as we mentioned earlier  instagram benefits from being a platform where brands can essentially publish ads without shoving them in their followers  faces   enter the rise of influencer marketing   simply put  influencer marketing entails a paid relationship with another instagram account with a sizeable  engaged follower count  influencers  audiences should ideally mirror your own or allow you to tap into a new sect of users that you re trying to reach   influencers are akin to ads in the sense that the relationship does indeed cost money  however  finding the right influencer can be an incredibly cost effective way to both sell products and grow your following   brands can spot influencers through hashtags and manual searching  or you can try instagram analytics tools such as tapinfluence or search an in depth database related to your business   tapinfluence s directory makes it easy to hone in on potential influencers who could help promote your  instagram presence     marketingunitech com   remember  when identifying influencers  just make sure they have a following that actually engages with their content  engagement rate calculators such as this one from phlanx can help give you peace of mind about any influencers in question   engagement rate is a crucial metric when looking for an influencer to help promote your instagram     rethink how you present your products and promotions  this is a simple tip but is definitely something worth mentioning  and it relates to that other kind of instagram promotion   the one with fun giveaways or sale items and can be incredibly valuable for your brand when done well   so when you promote your instagram in these instances  it s crucial to present your content as must see   instagram thrives on anything and everything  new   anything you can do to create a sense of hype is a major point in your favor   for example  check out how glossier hypes up their much requested eye cream by surprising their followers a day before it drops   uniqlo publishes hype heavy instagram promotions and content  including calls to action for followers to check out their exclusive merch   pinup girl also does a great job of highlighting why their products rock and allows their brand voice to shine through in the process   as a rule of thumb  think  so what  before you hit  publish  for your promotions on instagram  doing so will ultimately encourage you to write more compelling captions       run a contest or giveaway  here s some food for thought  brands that run contests grow their followings     faster than those that don t   you might notice that many brands  contest and giveaway related posts receive insane amounts of engagement and that s no accident  done correctly  social media contests can result in followers and fans although they can also attract freebie chasers  we recommend running a one time contest promotion on instagram to test the waters and determine whether or not contests are something you want to try for the long term       optimize your profile for promotion  as you work through how to promote instagram to new fans and followers   looking the part  is essential   this also applies to brands looking to attract more attention organically   let s take a look at what makes an optimized instagram profile  the good news is that there aren t too many moving pieces of your profile itself to worry about   orlando s east end market is a prime example of a simple yet optimized profile  for starters  their username  eastendmkt  is short and sweet  all the while easy to find for locals searching for it   a searchable username makes it much easier for potential followers to find you and promote your instagram  their bio also ticks the boxes of an optimized profile  including a clear profile picture  compelling bio  branding hashtag and trackable url  everything about this instagram bio lets us know what to expect from their feed and likewise that we re in the right place   an optimized bio includes a hashtag  link and essential contact information  they also feature their email and phone number which is something to consider if you re running a business account  east end also regularly tags other businesses and events to expand their profile s reach  oh  and not to mention their awesome visual content that their local followers love       take advantage of instagram stories and its latest features  stories are by far instagram s most popular feature   used by over     million users daily  brands should take advantage of stories as often as possible when promoting on instagram  for many businesses  this means publishing user generated photos and behind the scenes content  the beauty of stories is that you don t have to worry as much about your visuals being polished or  perfect    that said  creativity still counts when it comes to stories  among instagram s latest features  stories are always at the center of them  for example  new interactive stickers such as the new quiz sticker represent fresh ways that brands can engage with followers for a more unique and interactive type of instagram promo   instagram is consistently rolling out new features for stories including the new quiz stiicker  keeping up with instagram means staying active and on top of its latest features  if you re regularly publishing to stories and watching what other brands are doing  you ll always be in the know       consider running a paid campaign  last but not least  don t neglect the potential of paid promotion on instagram   after all  social media at large is becoming increasingly pay to play  as part of facebook s insanely in depth ad platform  you can use instagram s eye popping ad options to win over new customers   there are plenty of instagram success stories out there including this example from dunkin

       " 'what is big data   big data is characterized as the data that can not be prepared by customary methods and systems  because of its large size and complexity  the word big in big data means petabytes or exabytes of data  it is calculated that nearly     of the data that we have today has been generated in the last two years  this implies  exponential growth in data volume is going to proceed  this growth will increase further with the increase in iot  internet of things    data analytics mainly uses big data  it gives necessary insights into business operations of any business  it helps businesses in growth  competitiveness and profitability      need of big data    there are many challenges for handling a huge data in applications  big data is no longer growing trend  this is now time tested  accepted with a sound  secure  stable architecture  it is synchronized with information  generating efficient analytics by organizations  ranging from data oriented start ups to big technology giants around the globe  there are many tools on the internet  there is considerably more to it than big data alone   if you hold a large amount of various data  and from this you need to find out answers at fast  you may look at the opening gates called  the three v s  of the data  this means that you are ready to look at better solutions that fulfils your need of data  can you say that it is enough  of course not   do you want to turn your existing application asset to a bigger store for a theoretically possible performance  how big are your existing data security issues and how would you deal with the same on the new infrastructure  is your data  big  enough for these solutions  such questions carry you to a point where you have to think about a couple of significant things  you realize that first  the idea of building an efficient big data infrastructure  lies the need to build a decision on whether to present a big data infrastructure or not      why you should need big data in an organization   organizations or businesses requires a big data services to allow them to survive in a fast growing and increasingly competitive market where the sources and the requirements to store data are growing at exponential manner  to handle high volumes  the data storage should be elastic and scalable  cloud based storage is a better idea for most businesses because it reduces investments  there are no physical systems on site  means that it saves space and power consumption  it handles the data security issues  you require tools to enable virtualization and carry out data compression  you should require object based storage architecture to handle a large amount of files  organizations are looking out for the solution that can store complex unstructured data and which do not have predefined schemas   big data solutions do not force a schema onto the stored data  instead you can store any type of structured  semi structured or unstructured data and then apply a suitable schema when you query this data  big data solutions store data in raw format and apply a schema only when the data is read  this preserves all information within the data  this is contradictory to the way of traditional database      data magnitude determination   in       the first documented use of the term  big data  appeared in paper by scientists at nasa  it describes the problem facing by them with visualization  generally data sets are large  taxing the capacities of main memory  local disk and remote disk  this problem is big data  when there is a situation like data sets don t fit in main memory  or when they do not fit on local disk also  in such cases the solution is to acquire more resources   another most important factor is what you want to do with the data  the problem is big data solutions is that they are numerous  getting the perfect tool is important for the cost  efficiency and delivery constraints also  creating an understanding of these factors is a main requirement of big data infrastructure requirements      necessity of advanced analytics   an interesting thing that gives thought on analytics is  one of the financial services firm which turned to big data to better identify which new client opportunities warrant the most investment  the organization enhanced its client statistic information with third party data purchased from ebureau  the data service provider appended sales lead opportunities with buyer s occupation  earnings  age  retail histories and also related factors  the advanced data set is then applied to an algorithm  this identifies which new client leads should receive additional investment and which should not  the result has been     hike in new client win rates  at the similar instance  the firm has lowered sales related expenses by          there are some benefits that big data analytics offer are   getting answers to complex business problems  creating cost effective requirements to bring in more customers  analyzing existing values to predict faster and better business decisions  and also exploiting machine learning analytics to make self learning systems      right time for data transition and security issues   data driven transition must start with your business goals and also objectives  as you understand your business objectives then you are ready to create a roadmap for leveraging new data sources to help you achieve them  also  technology is not only enough to transform your organization into a data driven organization  creating a platform that understands data  securing the data and how to use it is just as necessary  the challenge of detecting and also preventing advanced persistent threats has bought the importance of security responsibilities in light

celluloid film of a wartime movie  hazy burnt orange  making any green look khaki  i look out at the late afternoon sun  and it s red  not nice autumn orange  though we have just entered summer  it s  red  in a field of haze  it has been for days  the afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn t too thick for the sun to get through   today was    degrees celsius  the winds have picked up  the firefighters have been at it for over a month  over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt   there isn t much green left on our map  huge portions of it are now soot black  you look at where the fires are  and the markers of them on the map overlap like you re looking at a field of wildflowers in blue  yellow  and red  people have lost their lives  people have lost their homes  the devastation of wildlife is huge   sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban  i watered my plants with reserve water from the shower  my one cat has asthma  i ve been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day  otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all  it s week three of this   we are in drought  again  and it looks worse this time  there are parts of nsw where the dams are empty  truly empty  dust fields that are massive  nothing able to grow in these conditions   the sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again   loud and multiple as i try to get to sleep  people who have it worse than my cat and can t breathe  i drive home and see firetrucks up by people s houses  i pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do   it s two weeks to christmas  and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun  places i ve been   places i know well   sit facing fires approaching them from all sides   i wish you all the luck in the world  is what i can say to those i know facing it  and what i get back is  we will stand and defend our home    these aren t small fires that burn out in days  these are firegrounds larger than sydney itself that have been burning for weeks  the hot air rises from them  along with the ash  and it meets the damp winds off the ocean  the result is a thunderstorm   you d think rain would put these fires out  it does not  the ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing  the fires keep raging  even as water  unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it  floods away from them  we get floods on top of fires  sooty water running away from a blaze that won t stop blazing   these thunderstorms are unlike any i have ever seen before  people say thunderstorms bring a false twilight  this is a very late twilight   nautical twilight  perhaps  early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting  and it s a while yet before the rain falls  though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones  you just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn t happen nearby   because these thunderstorms start new fires  they put nothing out  while  at the same time  bring more fire  more destruction   i ve sat on tenterhooks  waiting to hear whether i m needed to help evacuate people  i ve watched places i know well go up in smoke  i ve waded through that smoke haze  feeling like i have a constant burgeoning cold  trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place i live  where my loved ones live  is to be short lived   and then there are the arsonists  i m at a point where i d wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who  in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering  did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires  more water that we don t have spent on fighting them  planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people  more homes  and more wildlife are destroyed  all because of some absolute wanker who thought it d be  funny  or  cool    outside my window is sepia tones  it isn t usually  usually it s blue  and an australian green  and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks  it seems all is bathed in that burnt orange  we re all feeling it

things  an amazing space of wilderness  it tells you  so worthy of preserving  not a word about the fact that it is black   never before in my life have i been so tempted to edit a wikipedia article as i was just to add the salient point    it s on fire    there s little of it left  i tried to edit it  i had the sources i was going to cite with me  i don t understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out  as the fires are doing  the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is    climate change   they say   what climate change    i looked at cape town  south africa and thought   thank the fates we have it okay here    now i look outside and wonder how long it s all going to last  it s hard not to be

endeavour  not only would the life cycle of a product need to be rigorously researched  but the proven sustainability of a product would have to be heavily policed  an independent body would be required to refine and govern such a scheme  as it is unlikely that food manufacturers could be trusted to do it themselves    some may say that sustainability labelling is too complex and laborious to introduce  but the fact is   there are numerous independent studies     science sciencemag org content              full  that detail how sustainable different types of food are  the information is available  which means that sustainability labelling is possible  if consumers are being expected to make more environmentally conscious food choices  it is only fair that we are given clear information on food packaging that helps us do this   without government oversight and participation  sustainability labelling is unlikely to be implemented  so pressure from voters is needed to get governments to act  if you agree that the introduction of a sustainability labelling system would be a benefit to consumers  show your support by signing one of the petitions i have created  there is a uk petition and an eu petition  if neither is applicable to your country of residence  create your own petition to your government sustainability labelling for food packag',\n",
