       "It may be easy to get pessimistic about environmental problems, but if we examine things carefully, we find that our environment is in much better shape now than 50 years ago.\\n\\nIn the 60s and 70s, things were really, really bad. Our rivers and lakes were being rendered lifeless as they filled with raw sewage and industrial effluent. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was blunt in his assessment of the Hudson River. “The river from Troy to the south of Albany is one great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” There were advisories against swimming in the Great Lakes. The Cuyahoga river, famously, caught fire 13 times.\\n\\nOur air was also being poisoned by emissions from automobile exhausts, garbage incinerators, and power plants. Southern California was blanketed with a thick layer of photochemical smog. A smog event over Thanksgiving 1966 in New York killed 168 people. \\n\\nThe pesticide DDT was ravaging bird populations. It brought the Bald Eagle to the brink of extinction. \\n\\nEven Richard Nixon was speaking in dire terms about the nation's environment. In 1970, he said that if nothing was done, many urban areas would be uninhabitable by 1980.\\n\\nIt's now 2020. Our air is clean even over our largest cities. Our rivers and lakes are once again teeming with life. Bird populations have recovered. \\n\\nWhatever problems climate change poses, they are almost certain to be minor against what we faced in the years leading  up to the creation of the EPA. And for that we should be very happy.    1\n",

       "The most conservative estimates of a Green New Deal in the United States are above $10 trillion. We couldn't tax all of that, so we'd have to deficit spend.\\n\\nMany economists on the left argue that such deficit spending is not only \"worth it\": It's actually economically beneficial. One of them, Randall Wray, just testified in front of Congress about this. He is the co-author of a groundbreaking paper, [\"How to Pay for the Green New Deal.\"](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf)\\n\\nI think it's really important for environmentalists like me to understand this, so that we cannot be scared by fiscal conservatives claiming \"expertise\" into diluting a climate budget. However, most literature is a bit dense for new learners, so I'm working on infographics to break down the ideas.\\n\\nThis infographic explains Sector Balance, part of the reason why U.S. deficits are beneficial. To my knowledge, sector balance itself is accepted by most mainstream economists, as the data is clear.\\n\\nSome will disagree, and that's O.K. My hope is not to convince but to spark curiosity, and encourage environmentalists to empower themselves with economics. We will need massive spending to save the planet, and we should not be ashamed of it.\\n\\n[Sector Balance Infographic](https://imgur.com/a/RvWh34d)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",

With the help of concerned citizens, the ‘Green Warriors’ team analyzed water samples, rice, children’s hair, etc. and discovered that toxic chemicals are endangering the lives of the 14 million Indonesians who use the Citarum water. What was once considered paradise is now a brown sludge of human waste and dangerous substances like nonylphenol, antimony, and tributylphosphate. These findings prompted the Indonesian government to change its wastewater regulations. Recently, President Joko Widodo announced a new plan to clean up the Citarum.
