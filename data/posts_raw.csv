Academic fraud is driving ecological collapse. Elizabeth Warren is \*Harvard's First Professor of Color,\* if that is not academic fraud, what is? Here are dozens of peer reviewed links on academic fraud and ecological collapse. 

The 2 subjects most rife with academic fraud are green energy and food safety. Google got paid to suppress bad news about Monsanto. Forever chemicals were hidden from the public foe decades. Forever chemicals are turning all males sterile, and they're turning all males into females.

Petrochemical use is growing 7X faster than the human population. By 2030 more petrochemicals will be used to make things than will be burned in cars.

Why Greta Sucks,"100% private carbon wealth tax dividends means that the rich get taxed and 100% of the money goes back to the poor, with 0% for government. This is James Hansen's idea, if Greta won't support it, I won't support her.

This is crazy.  Population growth in the U.S., China and Japan, for example, has slowed for now, but it will accelerate - it won't stay like this. 

In addition, the article asserts that new research published in the Journal Global Environmental Change ""finds that global economic growth over the last decade has reduced climate mortality by a factor of five"". He is referring to human mortality, not wildlife.

Super proud of my Housemate - WNBR," Hi all!  


I've struggled with confidence and anxiety for quite a while and I have found the transition to Uni to be somewhat difficult, although I've found my housemates in 3rd year to be really supportive and in particular my housemate Sophie.  


With climate change being front page news, with many local governments declaring a climate emergency, I decided that I wanted to do something to help raise awareness whilst also going out of my comfort zone and challenging myself. I managed to find out about the World Naked Bike Ride - a fantastic peaceful protest ride in towns and cities across the UK to raise awareness for the vulnerability of cyclists and remove dependence on fossil fuels.  


After some research I decided to take the plunge and take part in the London ride last summer. After chatting about it with Sophie she decided that she would also be keen to take part as a keen environmentalist and also to provide me with some support. The ride is classified 'as bare as you dare' so we both agreed that we wouldn't go the full hog but we would ride in our underwear.  


We got an early train up to London with our bikes and made our way to sunny Hyde Park and joined everyone else for the start of the ride. We both got ready in Hyde Park where I stripped down to just my boxers whilst Sophie stripped down to just a pair of knickers.  


The ride was absolutely amazing with so many people being so supportive with a common core value of helping to protect the environment, and the ride helped me so much with my confidence and anxiety issues - I'm so grateful to have Sophie as a friend and I would urge anyone who is struggling with anxiety to look to their circle of friends for support! University can be difficult but there are always people who are willing to listen.  


She said she's happy for me to post an action shot from the day

True climate action requires deficit spending. An infographic on why that's O.K.,"The most conservative estimates of a GND in the United States are above $10 trillion. We couldn't tax all of that, so we'd have to deficit spend.

Many economists on the left argue that such deficit spending is not only ""worth it"": It's actually economically beneficial. One of them, Randall Wray, just testified in front of Congress about this. He is the co-author of a groundbreaking paper, [""How to Pay for the Green New Deal.""](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf)

I think it's really important for environmentalists like me to understand this, so that we cannot be scared by fiscal conservatives claiming ""expertise"" into diluting a climate budget. However, most literature is a bit dense for new learners, so I'm working on infographics to break down the ideas.

This infographic explains Sector Balance, part of the reason why U.S. deficits are beneficial. To my knowledge, sector balance itself is accepted by most mainstream economists, as the data is clear.

Some will disagree, and that's O.K. My hope is not to convince but to spark curiosity, and encourage environmentalists to empower themselves with economics. We will need massive spending to save the planet, and we should not be ashamed of it.

Putting Current Environmental Problems in Perspective,"It may be easy to get pessimistic about environmental problems, but if we examine things carefully, we find that our environment is in much better shape now than 50 years ago.

In the 60s and 70s, things were really, really bad. Our rivers and lakes were being rendered lifeless as they filled with raw sewage and industrial effluent. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was blunt in his assessment of the Hudson River. “The river from Troy to the south of Albany is one great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” There were advisories against swimming in the Great Lakes. The Cuyahoga river, famously, caught fire 13 times.

Our air was also being poisoned by emissions from automobile exhausts, garbage incinerators, and power plants. Southern California was blanketed with a thick layer of photochemical smog. A smog event over Thanksgiving 1966 in New York killed 168 people. 

The pesticide DDT was ravaging bird populations. It brought the Bald Eagle to the brink of extinction. 

Even Richard Nixon was speaking in dire terms about the nation's environment. In 1970, he said that if nothing was done, many urban areas would be uninhabitable by 1980.

It's now 2020. Our air is clean even over our largest cities. Our rivers and lakes are once again teeming with life. Bird populations have recovered.

The Salton Sea Disaster,"The Salton Sea, located inland in Southern California, is an environmental disaster that seems like something from an earlier time, when human activities were making our great bodies of water unfit for life.

The sea was created by accident. In 1905, a canal in the Imperial Valley smashed through its banks, resulting in a torrent of water flooding into a low lying valley. By the time the spill was stopped, 2 years later, a sea was formed. For a time, the area prospered. It became a popular vacation destination for SoCal residents. 

But by the 80s, things took a turn for the worse. The rivers that fed the Salton were polluted with agricultural runoff, and as the sea has no outlets, this pollution had no place to go. Over time, the water got dirtier and dirtier. The lack of an outlet also meant it got saltier. The Salton became increasingly unable to support life. In the 90s, thousands of birds died from eating botulism infested fish and in 1999, 8 million tilapia died in one day.

In September 2012, residents in Los Angeles noticed a putrid odor, like raw eggs. What happened was the Salton, 150 miles away, had a great die-off of fish, which released a tremendous amount of sulfur gas. 

You might imagine that environmentally minded Californians would do something about this, but you'd be wrong. In fact, they've made it worse. Imperial County recently agreed to transfer more water to San Diego, [the result being 40% less water for the Salton Sea.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433294/salton-sea-crisis-drying-up-asthma-toxic-dust-pictures) 

As the Sea dries up, even more bad things are apt to happen. The seabed is filled with toxic dust filled with heavy metals. The wind will be able to blow this harmful dust all over Southern California. 

Plans to dig a canal to the Gulf of California or install desalination plants have been shelved due to cost. [In 2018, voters approved $200 million](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3879) to manage the Sea's decline by suppressing the dust of the newly exposed ""playa"". Whether this will work is an open question and even if the toxic dust is stopped, there's still the loss of habitat for fish and birds, the loss of tourism that the sea once provided, and that morbid stench that will serve as a reminder of the consequences of man's hubris.",environment,1580162244,kernals12,0,1,True,2020-01-27 16:57:24

"MLK, the Environment &amp; Consumerism","In honor of MLK Day, I will start with a quote by him:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it.  He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind...       

&gt;Earth Overshoot Day marks  the date when humanity’s demand for ecological resources (fish and  forests, for instance) and services in a given year exceeds what Earth  can regenerate in that year. We keep growing this deficit by liquidating  the Earth’s natural capital and accumulating waste, primarily carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere. Andrew Simms originally conceived the concept  of Earth Overshoot Day while working at the UK think tank New Economics  Foundation.

&gt;  
&gt;""Approximately 1.7 billion people worldwide now belong to the  ""consumer class""—the group of people characterized by diets of highly  processed food, desire for bigger houses, more and bigger cars, higher  levels of debt, and lifestyles devoted to the accumulation of  non-essential goods.""

"The first entirely environmental music project: Inanna, a voice for the Earth","Inanna ([www.inannaworld.com](https://www.inannaworld.com)) is one of the few artists to dedicate her entire work to nature, animals and the planet in the age of the Anthropocene.

Inanna is a singer, bellydancer, environmentalist &amp; animal advocate of Italian origins. She explores new horizons of environmental music through a mesmerizing collection of future-oriented pieces. Her passion for Nature, animals, alternative music &amp; Middle Eastern sounds has brought her to give life to a genre-bending eco-ethno-electropop experiment. The interactions between humans, technology, animals and Nature are being witnessed and given a voice, bringing a hopeful message for the possible futures on Earth. 

Inanna's signature sound is the contemporary chant of an enchantress, a cyber-priestess standing between Nature and Culture, light &amp; dark, old &amp; new, feminine &amp; masculine, melting together in unique atmospheres. 

If Mother Nature had a voice, what would she sing? Inanna's mission is to deliver, through enchanting soundscapes and an innovative mixture of ancient and contemporary beats, a message of peace, environmentalism, respect for our planet and all its creatures.

Earth is what unites us all: it is our home.

This project aims to give a voice to Nature and animals in the age of massive exploitation, to female perspectives in politics to promote better care of the Earth. Inanna wants to shape hopeful visions of the future in a time where everything seems to be slipping through our hands.

Inanna's upcoming first album ""ACROTOPIA"" (2020), which will be released in 2 volumes, is dedicated to all futurists, visionaries, nature lovers, to all women seeking for new ways of being feminine, and to all alternative music lovers with a green heart.

"Banishing disposable coffee cups, does it always makes sense?","“*A new cafe culture is brewing in the San Francisco area, where a growing number of coffee houses are banishing paper to-go cups and replacing them with everything from glass jars to rental mugs and BYO cup policies.”* ([https://apnews.com/1281f2663dbb80ce6775974aea85953f](https://apnews.com/1281f2663dbb80ce6775974aea85953f) )

I applaud the intent and effort of larger coffee and fast-food chains around the globe to be a bit more environmental but let’s, just for the sake of the environment, try to understand whether some of their news generating actions make sense or not. Instead of just believing that some action is good, we should KNOW, with enough confidence, that it is good.

*“It would take between 20 (…) and more than 1,000 (…) uses, depending on the cup/mug type and the environmental indicator, to make up for the impacts of a single-use cup. If a reusable cup is used fewer times than that, the single-use cup is better for the environment.”* ([https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/07/reusable-or-disposable-which-coffee-cup-has-a-smaller-footprint/](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/07/reusable-or-disposable-which-coffee-cup-has-a-smaller-footprint/))

Up to 1000 uses = one cup once a day for almost three years! Easily doable yet how many cups, jars and mugs actually reach that milestone. Fortunately it’s not all bad news! Some of the ideas to consider in order to have even more meaningful impact:

* If you have to buy one then use the disposable coffee cup more than once — usually nothing drastic happens (it doesn’t run away or start biting) to it once your coffee is finished and, instead of just dropping it to bin, you can use it several times;
* Stop using lids on disposable coffee cup unless you are driving a car — you are the pinnacle of billions of years of evolution who can handle even the almost full coffee cup without spilling it (most of the time);
* Stop washing reusable cup in between every serving — a few drops of coffee in the bottom of your cup won’t affect the taste or quality of the next serving and your delicate avocado-celery-cucumber smoothie nursed digestive tract can most surely handle it as well;
* Have a number of reusable cups shared by everyone in your office, but not too many, as this makes the solution redundant. Caffeine, in spite of our occasional morning comments, is not a life saver, nothing will happen to a person who can’t get the caffeine dose immediately. But if you are well and truly hooked, and really can’t wait for it, then have your doctor write you a prescription to wave around in case you need to force a mug from someone’s hands;
* Stop drinking milk or plant based fluids with your holy dose of energizer — it really doesn’t matter if instead of robbing milk from baby cows you fill up your cup with almond or soya milk, those products all have heavy environmental impact;
* Drink less coffee and tea — every cup you consume means resources spent on the equipment to serve you, to heat up the water, to transport and prepare coffee beans or tea leafs for consumption as well as disposing the leftovers. Drinking tap water is a socially acceptable form of consuming liquids and extinguing thirst;
* While stocking the coffee corner of your office kitchen, you can ask your team members to bring their own mugs or even a couple of more used ones from their homes;
* Know that, while opening your dream come true bakery or coffee house, there is no law about how the coffee mugs in your bakery have to look like. So for example you can ask your family members and friends to dip in or ask your first customers to pay for their coffee with used items like coffee mugs, plates, cutlery and so on.

I’m sure that almost everyone can have a meaningful and smart impact once you really start thinking about the environment and instead of cruising on autopilot, change your behaviour and attitude.

"No, We Don't Need Endless Population Growth","The New York Times recently published an article that [described China's](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#commentsContainer) declining birth rate as a ""crisis"". They went through the normal handwringing about how there'd never be enough young people to support that country's aging population. The comments section rightly chewed them out for claiming that a country with 1.4 billion people needs even more. This sentiment is common and has been applied everywhere to tell us that we need more and more people or our aging population is going to bankrupt us.

Endless population growth to keep pensions solvent is like setting fire to your lawn to kill the gophers. There are many better ways to adapt. The reason why pensions are in crisis is because life expectancy has gone up, but the retirement age hasn't. We can solve this by indexing the retirement age to life expectancy. The Social Security Administration estimates that this reform, which would raise the retirement age about 1 month every 2 years, would stop the cost from [rising relative to taxable payroll after 2035](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/provisions/charts/chart_run107.html). Denmark has done this and it is projected to [save them a tremendous amount](https://oecdecoscope.blog/2019/01/15/ambitious-retirement-age-indexation-ensures-sustainable-public-finances-in-denmark/). 

We should also be optimistic that medical science will greatly reduce the cost of caring for the growing ranks of seniors. Let's take the most dreaded ailment of old age, dementia. It's a horrific disease for its victims and their loved ones. It's also staggeringly expensive, costing Medicare and Medicaid [$195 billion in 2019](https://act.alz.org/site/DocServer/2012_Costs_Fact_Sheet_version_2.pdf?docID=7161), as its sufferers generally require constant care for many years. Dementia only receives a fraction as much money in research as cancer or heart disease. If we could find an effective treatment or a cure, it would massively relieve the burden of the aging population.

Dementia happens to be part of a class of diseases caused by the misfolding of proteins. Other such diseases include Diabetes, Parkinson's, Cataracts and possibly [Multiple Sclerosis](https://www.mdedge.com/clinicalneurologynews/article/157658/multiple-sclerosis/ms-may-be-transmissible-protein-misfolding). Our ability to understand protein folding has been limited by the fact that a protein, in a fraction of a second, can fold in a number of ways that exceeds the number of [seconds since the Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinthal%27s_paradox). But those new fangled quantum computers could [efficiently crack this problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02163), providing us with the knowledge needed to tame these diseases. 

What all this means is far more seniors would be able to live on their own without round the clock care and our aging population won't be a burden.

Should we re-introduce wolves to Eastern America or let the coyotes handle it?,"Now I know the answer to this seems like an obvious yes. An ecosystem needs a true top predator and just about everywhere East of the Mississippi is lacking one, so it would seem logical to put wolves back in rather than just wait for the ones out West to expand. Especially when the ones that were East historically where a different kind than the ones we put out West but that's a less important issue.

However, I feel like we could do nothing and still get the role filled, which would allow us to focus our efforts elsewhere.

Coyotes have expanded far eastward thanks to humans wiping out the wolves that used to limit them. A coyote, even in their loose packs, would not be big enough to be a predator to the deer of the area (something necessary for a top predator to do here).

Because the niche is unfilled though, and because coyotes are so genetically close to wolves already, I would assume that they will naturally evolve to become big enough. The reward for even transitioning would be access to deer that are not quite as sick, young or old and the end reward is uncontested access to the deer population.

Speeding up this process is hybridization. An average coyote is only about 30 pounds, but when crossed with a wolf it adds 10 pounds to its average. Crossing with a dog can lead to varying results because of how diverse dogs are. It can lead to even smaller children or to much larger ones.

And in both hybridizations it was noted that the offspring become better at cooperation than a regular coyote.

With larger hybrids likely getting mates more easily due to their size and having a better mortality rate due to a firmer pack structure they can effectively boost the process of evolution.

Will they evolve far enough into the role of top predator in time to hold off the wolves from the North and the West when they eventually try trickling back in? I don't know, but the important thing is that they fill the role in the time the wolves are not there.

If they succeed it would save us quite a bit of effort as there's nothing we would have to actively do.

So the question for us becomes whether or not we believe it to be possible. If we don't think it is then we go ahead with re-introduction efforts. If we do think it's possible we can cross that re-introduction effort off the list.",environment,1579642464,BolbyB,1,1,True,2020-01-21 16:34:24

Rate my transformation plan (lol),"It's just something I typed up that I thought would cover most of our problems. Rate it if you please. (It's translated from another language.)

We need a price on carbon dioxide emissions, progressively increasing by 5% each year. The cement and the steel mill industry? Shut down until they come up with greenhouse gas-free alternatives, which they ""promise"" they'll have ""within 5 years, tops!"". Force everyone to abandon letters for bills, and every other reason for letters for that matter. SMS and other digital options work just as well, if not better. Everyone knows that it is only old men/women who want to keep their letters. Force the delivery companies that operate within cities (not long haul, at least initially) to go electric. The tech is there, just subsidise them if they literally can't afford to make the cross.

Growth economy? Eh. The options are out there, known, and hardly that advanced. In fact, we only accept today's growth economy because it ""kind of worked so far,"" even though it literally hasn't. A cross *will* be hard to get, but ""only"" politically. Practically there's really no issues with experimenting and seeing what sticks.

Phase out flights almost completely. 15% extra flight tax every other year until 5% of flights remain. 95% of the aircraft that are taking off today do so unnecessarily and they're literally mostly holidays and business trips, as well as ""express shipping"" that can be solved in other ways. Fairly sure 5% is an exaggeration as well.

What remains are the cars, our consumption and the meat. Cow meat can be cut 50% without any real problems. Then we'll eat like in the 80s, and ""everything was terrible then"". Subsidise vegetarian alternatives and take the money directly from the meat industry until you reach a level that's sustainable.

Cars are a more difficult problem, but getting rid of the massive amount of short distance trips should be doable. A petrol tax for those living in cities maybe? Maybe just tax based on where you live, instead of taxing petrol directly, as that would make people outside the cities suffer. Then the countryside is being spared, but they should definitely have a higher gasoline prices compared to today anyway, since gas prices are not (yet) a significant portion of people's wages. In the end, we have a virtually fossil-free society where 80% of the short trips are done using lighter vehicles, without a passenger compartment (non-cars). Many buses. Many light electric vehicles (of which there are many). Car traffic has now gone down as a result, and roads that today take up huge areas of our cities can be converted to ""non-stop"" bicycle highways, which work great in Denmark and the Netherlands. ""There are no buses where I live!"" is solved by making it so that there is a bus where you live (you whiner).

Consumption, however, is the most difficult, but it can be done. The goal is to reduce consumption and increase local production. Products from abroad will be automatically ""taxed"" with the carbon dioxide tax, but there are many variables here (in terms of CO2 emissions per product), and a society should always prioritize what's actually necessary. Clothes? Not so badly necessary to have at our consumption levels (high), because it is a CO2 intensive product. Furniture? Hard question, but maybe have an extra tax on furniture that is considered to low-quality in some way? Exactly how to implement this I can't tell straight away, but furniture needs to be of high quality (lasts long) for a sustainable society. The same can be said about small gadgets and electronic gadgets, which we all love. A 5 year ""right to return"" warranty issued by the government should do the trick. If it breaks within that period and you can prove the manufacturer is at fault, you're legally entitled to a replacement of similar quality, or your money back.",environment,1579653251,Ree_the_third,0,1,True,2020-01-21 19:34:11

"We are an initiative with a plan to stop climate change. We have a strategy to carry out solutions at a global scale, but we need your support. Help us in making it possible.","# Overview of The Restore Project

It's not the lack of technology, will, or money that is preventing our society from taking action against climate change. Apart from few notable exceptions, almost every company and government today acknowledges the need to act immediately - but they still cannot do it at the scale and speed required.

**What we are missing is coordination at a global scale, as well as systematic planning and execution.**

The Restore Project is an apolitical and independent initiative that aims to solve this.

However, to make it possible everyone needs to be involved: companies, governments, institutions, investors, the scientific community, and – most importantly – the people.

Our aim is to unite them all towards a specific goal, providing a strategy and a set of solutions that allow for immediate global action.

About how we plan to do that:

* Climate experts, scientists and engineers will be involved to identify the most appropriate technologies and solutions to implement;
* We will devise the most effective strategies to realise such solutions at a global and national scale – also directly working with governments, companies and institutions to speed up and facilitate their realisation;
* Investments will be concentrated in the most impactful projects aiming to solve the root causes of climate change;
* To maximise global impact, we plan to join forces with existing initiatives all over the world.

Distraught about Flight Reductions.,"
I travel for business - typically 7 transoceanic flights per year. Last year I reduced it as much as I could - down to 3. Even then I blamed my employer - “I HAD to go...”

I feel like I should have a little less guilt, but those planes still took off. In order for an airline to cancel a route, it would have to become unprofitable - and that would take a LOT more people than just me. 

Recently I wanted to take a weekend getaway to a nearby city and looked into alternatives. 

Mode of transport	Round trip cost 	One way time
Flying (economy)	$150	1.5 hours
Driving	$120	11 hours
Train (economy)	$200	9 hours
Train (sleeper cabin) 	$400	9 hours

My partner asked me how much quality of life I was willing to give up to avoid flying - especially since those planes are still going to take off with or without us. And I see her point... will we never travel outside our city again?

What will the World need to give up to become net-zero in carbon emissions?,"It has occurred to me that though I am heavily in favour of action on climate change, there are considerations beyond just scrapping carbon emissions totally. Contingencies and alternatives for the global economy. Green energy is obviously the most developed net-zero industry with the many applicable and cheap options now for energy generation alternatives to fossil fuels. That has to be a long-term focus and perhaps a policy that all countries become signatories of, agreeing to replace their energy systems entirely with renewable, net-zero alternatives. It certainly is possible, in comparison to some other things I will mention. 

For transportation, it appears at least to me, that electric vehicles, electric trains, electric trucks have been positioned as easily employable and comparable alternatives to their fossil fuel counterparts. In the case of electric cars, it is actually [marginally cheaper in terms of cost per mile](https://pod-point.com/guides/driver/cost-of-charging-electric-car) (depending on where you live) for road users than diesel or petrol cars. Still, offsetting range for the environment is acceptable under casual terms of using a car. For cargo vehicles, I don’t believe the current technology can match the demand of the industry. As with haulage for example, Tesla’s electric semi-truck is Said to offer 620 miles range unloaded and between 300-500 miles unloaded. For short-distance cargo, these ranges sound ideal, but for long-range haulage these trucks will not be able to replace the role of trucks powered by fossil fuels on journeys such as those that take a truck across the United States or across Europe without refuelling. A 30 minute charge time every 300-500 miles is not option for an industry that already runs on the very edge of time. It doesn’t appear that there can be a trade off on time for businesses and deliveries.

Planes - The commercial and civil aviation industry isn’t as big a source of emissions as many people think - 2.4% of total fossil fuel Emissions and 17% of transport emissions - still significant and it will continue to grow extensively. Commercial aviation has changed the world and the benefits are everywhere - shrinking distances between continents for work and tourism, fast and safe travel, express deliveries around the world for deliveries that really are urgent. Without being too conscientious, it’s safe to say that without some revolution in aircraft design, the civil and commercial aviation industry will die to satisfy net-zero carbon concerns; something that needs to happen if it is to save the planet but it would be a huge shame to lose the benefits of. The world has enjoyed these benefits for so many years now that its grow to work around this Industry.

Climate action is necessary, but there are has to be some serious planning put into it. Governments have to unanimously commit to it, and the world needs some serious innovations. I don’t feel there is a compromise on any of this. The economy and energy generation need to adapt and innovate together, and one cannot suffer because of the other. People’s lives are at stake in both cases - in energy and the climate. That is again, why the global effort needs to be focused on it - the task ahead is more than just achieving a carbon-zero world; its achieving a carbon-zero world, finding energy alternatives for transport that are comparable or better in terms of performance than current carbon ones and doing all this whilst not tanking the global economy.",environment,1579726434,ecanchoun,10,1,True,2020-01-22 15:53:54

Mnunchin Critiques Thunberg on Divestment,"Link to original story:

Since you apparently need a relevant degree in the area to speak toward the subject of fossil fuel divestment, I feel my BS in Finance and MBA in Financial Analytics more than qualify me to tell Mnunchin and those who feel similarly that continued heavy investment in fossil fuels is not just climatologically illiterate, but recklessly stupid from a purely economic standpoint. Since I am a data-driven person who does my best to rely on facts to substantiate my opinions rather than heresay, fallacies, a number of intentional non-considerations, and outright lies, here's a small body of leading research that discusses and substantiates divestment from fossil fuels not only to address the anthropogenic climate risks, but also the gargantuan economic risks which come alongside it. Don't take my word on it, though, read for yourselves. Here's a few key excerpts, links included:

""This paper makes the case for divestment as a proper financial response by investment trustees to current market conditions and to the outlook facing the coal, oil and gas sectors.

"No, We Are Not Going to Go Extinct","Climate change is a problem that we must face, but unfounded hysterical predictions do not help at all. Let's start with the big one: no, a rise in temperatures is not going to kill us. We humans can survive and thrive in some very hot climates, just look at Phoenix or Dubai. Let's remember what's causing this climate crisis, it's our rising standard of living, and that same rising standard of living will mean the now-poor people in equatorial regions will probably be able to afford air conditioning by the middle of this century. Life will go on, it's just that more of it will go on indoors. 

It's likely that some places will become unable to support agriculture, but there are many places that due to a longer growing season will be able to support more agriculture. Also, we've got technological progress on the horizon which will mean we no longer need farms to provide food in the form of [cellular agriculture.](https://www.new-harvest.org/cell_ag_101) 

Climate change will bring many problems, namely more extreme storms and greater risk of floods, but based on the most likely trend in carbon emissions, they are nothing we can't adapt to. We will survive just fine.",environment,1579800444,kernals12,108,1,True,2020-01-23 12:27:24

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/politics/mnuchin-says-thunberg-should-study-economics-in-college-before-calling-on-divestment-of-fossil-fuel.amp

Since you apparently need a relevant degree in the area to speak toward the subject of fossil fuel divestment, I feel my BS in Finance and MBA in Financial Analytics more than qualify me to tell Mnunchin and those who feel similarly that continued heavy investment in fossil fuels is not just climatologically illiterate, but recklessly stupid from a purely economic standpoint. Since I am a data-driven person who does my best to rely on facts to substantiate my opinions rather than heresay, fallacies, a number of intentional non-considerations, and outright lies, here's a small body of leading reports that discuss and confirm divestment from fossil fuels not only to address the anthropogenic climate risks, but also the gargantuan economic risks which come alongside it. Don't take my word on it, though, read for yourselves. Here's a few key excerpts, links included:

""This paper makes the case for divestment as a proper financial response by investment trustees to current market conditions and to the outlook facing the coal, oil and gas sectors. It is driven principally by the likelihood that future returns from the fossil fuel sector will not replicate past performance. The financial case for fossil fuel divestment is strong. Over the past three and five years, respectively, global stock indexes without fossil fuel holdings have outperformed otherwise identical indexes that include fossil fuel companies.

Idk if this is the right place but pls share this everywhere cause we need more awareness and actual efforts here.," Please take your time to read this. First of all, I may just be a mere 14 year old but I would like to make some things clear here as the situation of our own planet is getting way too dire. And before you start shooting crap at me, do your research first as I've done mine.

 We, humans, have managed to hunt an estimated 700 species of animals to extinction and around a million are endangered at this very moment. Yet we have world leaders here who can't even acknowledge climate change is real, world leaders who don't give a damn about the ecosystem and people saying killing anything ""lesser"" than you is fine cause it's ""just an animal."" Then there're these unnecessary animal sacrifices just cause of ""culture,"" so basically murdering others is a part of being you guys? Aight okay. And people should stop cutting down trees or harming and killing animals just for money, honestly.

 Let me tell y'all something. Put yourselves in the place of those animals. Imagine you're sitting there minding your own business and then some asshole comes over, destroys your home and kills you just for your fur or sth. Sure eating is fine cause food chain but seriously, doesn't it concern any of you that we could be doing it in excess? And the least you can do is make their death painless. Bro, we're literally in the sixth mass extinction right now. Search it up.

 And this WWIII topic shouldn't even be a thing rn like wtf is up with people only wanting to fill money in their pockets (the government)? Y'all don't give a fuck, do you? That your people have to suffer in your stead cause of how stupid you were? And you could be focusing on better things like THE FCKIN PLANET DYING BECAUSE OF Y'ALL but noooo. You don't care cause you got money. Lmao bruh like you wouldn't even be where you are now if the environment was SHIT.

 Like your fucking children are going to be living in a fucking dystopian world and they're gonna think, ""Why didn't we do anything sooner?"" THERE IS A LACK OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS RIGHT NOW CAUSE YOU PEOPLE DON'T CARE. NONE OF WHAT WE SAY MATTERS BECAUSE ""we're just normal people."" Tf are the authorities doing? Like how tf did you all even become leaders? We have so many fucking ignorant and selfish retards in this world and YOU ALL SHOULD FRICKIN START CARING CAUSE THIS IS OUR FUCKING PLANET AND YOU'RE THE ONES KILLING IT.

 This isn't progress. Because all we've done so far was manage to wipe out other organisms and destroy nature's wildlife, what the planet gave us. We've been failing not just individually but as a race altogether. We should all step up and start actually fucking trying. Just a few conservation groups like Greenpeace can't do everything themselves. Instead of depending only on THEM, WE OURSELVES, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO DO IT ALONE, SHOULD BE TRYING. We learn all these things at school about plastic and shit but do most of you care? Nope.

 Guys, please, Imma be frank here, if we're not the ones to do this, who are? We should start incorporating the Three R's into our daily routine and taking part in all conservation efforts as much as we can NOW instead of regretting it later when the weather patterns start becoming too frickin erratic. 

 Don't go all, ""I'm just trying my hardest to live my own life,"" cause you wouldn't have one if your environment was utter shit as in only flames and burning everywhere. This is YOUR PROBLEM TOO because this is YOUR PLANET. WE'RE ALL LIVING ON IT. GLOBAL WARMING AND ALL THIS, IT'S OUR PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE TOGETHER. Some day... our planet will actually be nothing but a charred black ball, if we don't do anything now. Some of us are actually begging you here.

Mobile adverts damage the environment,"In order for adverts to be displayed on any device, they have to be created. This requires energy, so its a waste.

Advert files have to be stored somewhere, so normally they are stored on a server - or many servers. The making of a server includes the use of more energy, materials that can be damaging to the environment and potentially non-recyclable. 

Now that they are created and stored, they need to be distributed. This makes everybody's' networks slower as they only have a limited bandwidth - an allowance of speed and data transmission per network. Each packet of the advert is using up bandwidth, especially the new trend of video ads. For those on a meted network, it starts to cost money. Particular with mobile and devices that rely on battery, the battery drains faster but its overall lifespan is significantly reduced, meaning that new batteries have to be put in, the old batteries go and damage the environment with their toxic chemicals, while the production of the new batteries causes more damage. Now lets talk CPU, the Central Processing Unit converts the bits of data and displays them, communicating with graphics processor and speakers along the way, which also incur damage through overuse. If a CPU has too much load then it can overheat and get damaged very quickly, again requiring replacement similar to the batteries. As if that is not enough, lots of people might not replace components of a device as sometimes it is more expensive than just buying a new device, so old devices get put in landfill or silicone valley.",environment,1579002597,Lawsonator85,0,1,True,2020-01-14 06:49:57

Fossil fuel company stocks are dramatically under preforming. Will easy capital start to dry up for emitters?,"Based on the recent reporting by BlackRock, one of the major reasons for pulling out is in the following quote: 

&gt;Had Mr. Fink  moved a decade ago to pull BlackRock’s funds out of companies that  contribute to climate change, his clients would have been well served.  In the past 10 years, through Friday, companies in the S&amp;P 500  energy sector had gained just 2 percent in total. In the same period,  the broader S&amp;P 500 nearly tripled.

Is it possible major investment firms will start to see a major opportunity cost involved with investing in fossil fuel companies and move their capital elsewhere? Seems like we could be on the precipice of a major shift if this is the case.

Koalas not Coal,"**A big coal mine (Wallarah 2) has been approved on the Central Coast NSW and in the vicinity of koala habitat.** The local communities have been working to stop this mine for over 20 years.

"RAIN! HELIUM is the CARRIER for NITROGEN to Freeze, Radiate and Fusion/Sprite together molecules for OZONE and FRESH WATER.","[Princeton Helium Bubble Electron Reaction](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.hep.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/hebubble.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj76-Haq4bnAhXKl54KHT__CmkQFjADegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-xyt8ZykhaHSXAPK8nq7l)

So knowing that... lets play Follow the Bubble:


1. Helium Bubbles through fertile soil traveling with just a smidge of water vapor and it rises fast. 


2. If enough helium bubbles were releases. They would contact Liquid Nitrogen and could bubble IN but instead of flying through they would act like a parachute or hot air balloon and LIFT the heavy gravity bound Nitrogen.


3. Nitrogen shoots up like a filled balloon in the atmosphere.


4. Nitrogen freezes at a certain temperature. With the helium inside.


5. Nitrogen has only a thin barrier to obscure Solar Radiation before it is a... magnifying glass.


I theorize:

That If a child can burn a tree with a simple magnifying glass in moments, on the ground.


Then: 


The potential to amplify solar radiation through frozen nitrogen at an exponentially closer place to the sun is that.. FOLD. many many many times over.


It is without a doubt possible that a Fusion reaction could take place.

IF a fusion reaction were to take place that high up? It would be ABOVE the clouds. There is little to NO Oxygen.

AND if there is no oxygen, there can be no flame. But.. there can always be a burn. This leads me to SPRITES.


SPRITES: 

Sprites have No known Purpose.

I had never heard of a SPRITE before my research. But a Sprite is lightning ABOVE the clouds. It is regarded as a phenomena, but NOT a process. 


I do not believe the earth would have that large of a phenomena. Without a functional process. 


I theorize this is the FUSION REACTION.

There is No Flame, because there is No Oxygen. But this could be a BURN, a burn without a flame.


By my estimation, and multiple articles on helium bubbles what I have described above IS the process. ",environment,1579118499,karlamoxleyEarthPhys,6,1,True,2020-01-15 15:01:39

Request for Survey Responses Regarding Composting," 

Hello All! Managing food waste is one of the most effective tools for mitigating the effects of climate change as you may already know. My brother and I are currently working on collecting data about the composting habits of people in the United States in order to understand ways to improve the composting process for consumers. Our aim is to get more people involved in composting and to make it more convenient. We’re asking folks to take a quick 5 minute survey in order to do this. We’d love to hear from you.

Why? Saving fossil fuel one day a week is a 14% reduction. That's a good start.

MEGA Day 2: Once day a week, do not **create** any throw-away. No recycling, no garbage, etc.  Use personal mug in coffee shops. If ordering take-out, only buy from restaurants that either allow me to bring my own containers or provide compostable ones.

Why bother arguing CO2 emission in Canada?,"Don't curse at me just yet. I deeply care about the environment like everyone of you here in this subreddit and just want to be neutrally practical.

Canada accounts for 2% of global CO2 emission. I know per capita it's a lot, but to be practical the global warming does not care about how effective we are reducing that 2% of emission while it can be so easily compensated by other major emitters like US or China. So again from a practical perspective, we should coordinate with other global major emitters on a reduced emission plan before we make any costly change to our energy usage. It looks to me that we are making this a huge issue domestically, making our governments spending huge sums to develop green energy and bring down Canadian CO2 emission while US and China are gladly eating away our CO2 reduction without even thanking us.

It takes just 3 of Bayer's neonic seeds to kill one bird, and it's water soluble. But, no one single chemical is to blame, and no one studies their cumulative synergies. Most chemicals, are not tested for safety.

Anyone else depressed about how polluted our environement is?,"After taking a look at myself and my family during Christmas, I felt really upset about the efforts I failed to put towards properly seperate all of my recyclables and waste. I wanted to show my children that humans make mistakes, but once we know better, it's our responsibility to do better. I immediately found an app for my location that let's me see where the nearest recycling drop off locations are for a variety of waste ranging from bulbs, batteries, Styrofoam, plastic bags, etc. I have a small system prepped to seperate all these items and then I've committed to delivering these bins once they are full of recyclables. Additionally, I looked into finding a way to buy snacks and food from wholesale stores where I can store them in reusable containers rather than buy them in individual wrappers. Essentially, I am making a concerted effort to reduce the waste my family makes and our effect on the world.

Cut to Sunday night... Me and the wife notice a new documentary series on Netflix and decide to watch the episode discussing recycling and the impact on the world. It was incredibly eye opening and depressing. I was sad to learn that most of the plastic we seperate for recycling cannot be recycled and will end up being purchased in bulk for the small portions thst can be reused, while the rest will be left in a landfill, get blown into the ocean, and or be burned, releasing more toxic gas into the atmosphere.

Does anyone else feel this way about the current state of the world? Why are we so powerless to change these things when we have discovered new and more eco friendly / sustainable ways to continue living our lives? Is the cost to each person really the issue? Or are we actually incapable of holding the industries accountable to the world?

"USA Answer I am sick of hearing that we have Climate Crisis, and because of that we have to eliminate all fossil fuels, NOW","I agree that the climate is changing.

I do not agree that  the USA is the only problem

I do not agree with Climate Alarmists and politicians who are trying to get your votes from fear.

All I hear is that we are the problem with this crisis, and all of  you have to vote for me because I will declare an emergency when I am elected. Eliminate all gas or diesel vehicles NOW. Cut the subsidies to force the politicians to fix the problem. **Renewable's NOW!**

It seems that ½ of this country has completely lost their minds!  

No one has done the math. 

Let me show you. Today is 1/8/2020  Just for Giggles and Grins, lets say magically all cars, trucks and gas engine vehicles were electric today.  

This is a 30,000 foot view of the situation, and this discussion is only for today, because 10 / 20 / 50 ++ years from now we will need much more because we will grow in population, homes, businesses, and vehicles.  

Currently there about are 273 Million ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) powered vehicles.  [Number of cars in U.S. | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183505/number-of-vehicles-in-the-united-states-since-1990/)  They all need to be charged to operate. On average, lets assume that they all have the same capacity as a new Tesla, 100KWh, that their batteries store enough energy to drive 400 miles. Now I know all of you will say this or that, that the we do not need to charge from nothing, that there is something left in the battery.  

I agree.  I try to fill up my car with gas on average when the car is between empty and ½ full. Lets say on average we Americans fill our tanks when there is 1/3 left.  So if we extend this thinking, then all cars will need to be “fueled” with electricity when they still have 1/3 energy still left.  At 100,000 Watt Hours, they will need, lets call it 67,000 Watt Hours of energy.  On average Americans fill up their tanks ONCE A month per Google.  So each month, 273 million cars will need 67,000 Watt Hours of energy. 

About 18.3 TRILLION Watt Hours of energy will be needed from the grid, per month.  Total USA production of electricity is 4.17 Quadrillion Watt Hours PER YEAR!  [What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3)  So we need 12 months x 18.3 Trillion Watt Hours = 219.5 Trillion Watt Hours,  just for our cars / trucks etc, on top of the 4.17 Quadrillion Watt Hours that runs our country.  A total of 4.4 Quadrillion Watt Hours need to be produced EACH YEAR.  A 6% increase to produce 219.5 Trillion Watt Hours for our cars and trucks (lets round that to 220)! Doesn't sound that much does it?  

But lets peel the onion further..........................................................  

USA has 98 operational Nuclear Reactors that generated 807 Trillion Watt Hours a year.  [Nuclear Power in the USA](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-power.aspx)  So we would need another 27 more Nuclear power plants **just to power the vehicles.**  Obviously that won't work, since we have stopped all Nuclear Power Plant construct except one in Georgia, that will be done for next year. There are just 7 new ones proposed, and they don't look too good.  

**OK, lets look at Solar**  We need 220 Trillion Watt Hours for EV's. Lets look at one of the highest output solar farm  [Desert Sunlight Solar Farm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Sunlight_Solar_Farm)  Desert Sunlight 300, LLC produced 703 Billion Watt Hours in 2017. So we would need another 313 OF THESE solar farms JUST FOR vehicles. 

But there are a few problems.  “*In 2012 the National Parks Conservation Association issued a report identifying three desert solar power plants sited within five miles of National Parks in the California Desert as projects that* ***they suggest it should not have been approved in their locations, including the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm****. The group cites damage to visual resources, and impacts on desert species “*  

The next question is, where can they go now that there is a backlash that these “Farms” have wrecked havoc with the local environment?  Also remember. **They don't work at night or in snow (Solar Farms in ALASKA? Come on!)**

They are not that great in lots of rain (but the rain does clean them off, cools them and that promotes efficiency) 

**OK, Wind, how about that?**  As of 2019, there was 67 Terra Watt Hours installed annually that supply the basic grid. So we will need about **4 times more just for vehicles.**  Yep it can be done, just remember that while we have the area to do that, primarily from Texas up the central USA which has the best land available with wind. We will need massive upgrades in the grid to move that across the country.  **Wind is variable especially at night** when the turbines MUST have at least 8 – 12 MPH of constant wind just to keep turning, and if they stop, they need 15 MPH constant wind to start turning again. Google it.  

The problem is the availability **WHERE** it is needed **WHEN** it is needed! There is a lot of complex issues that would have to be addressed. As I said, I am looking at the BIG 30,000 foot picture.  

I already know there will be magnitudes improvements in storage (I hesitate to use the word battery, because of the 75 minute charge cycle for a car (Tesla) or worse for a truck. In the long view, it will never work until we can recharge our cars in 15 minutes.  So gas engines for vehicles will be around for a LONG LONG time. We WILL have a lot more solar and wind. But 24/7, obviously not!  Some people think we can have storage batteries, but come on!  You would need to turn New Jersey into a battery just to run New York City!  

We will be able to go 100% electric transportation when we have deployed 100's of FUSION reactors (they are coming in the next decade, but different discussion), and upgraded our grid and developed a new storage system for vehicles that can be recharged in 15 minutes as I said.

I am going out on a limb and say, 150 - 200 years?  Like I said, this is my 30,000 foot view of the issue.

"Yes, Climate Change really is an appropriate subject for r/environmentalism."," **What the hell is wrong with the moderators of this sub? I posted this a couple of days ago, and it was removed because it was deemed not appropriate. It is hard to imagine anything that could be more appropriate.**

**Title: Why does anybody still believe we can stop climate change?:**

We have known climate change was an  existential threat to industrialised civilisation for over 30 years now.  It has become apparent in recent years that the threat had been  underestimated. And yet greenhouse emissions are still rising, the  population is still rising, and we have made no progress whatsoever in  making systemic changes. For example, though the UK government has  accepted climate change is a serious threat to civilisation and must be  stopped, it nevertheless decided, after very lengthy deliberations, that  it is necessary to expand Heathrow Airport. The reason is that if this  doesn't happen, the Dutch will expand their capacity and threaten  Heathrow's position as the most important aviation hub in Europe. This  is madness. Unfortunately, it is also reality.

We  are not going to stop climate change. Even if we did everything humanly  possible to stop it, there's probably 3 to 4 degrees “baked into the  cake”. And the politics says we won't do everything possible. This isn't  about ""should"" or ""shouldn't"". It's about ""won't"".

This  is about global co-operation, or the impossibility of it. We have no  hope of even getting one major sovereign state to agree internally to  the sort of sacrifices needed (banning cheap air travel, limiting  population growth, etc....). But to actually stop the eco-catastrophe,  we'd have to get all the major sovereign states to agree between them to  make those sacrifices. This is pure fantasy. It can't happen in the  real world. On the contrary – in the difficult times to come, what is  actually going to take place is a desperate fight for survival, at all  sorts of levels. If the human race couldn't get together to sort out its  differences during the “good times” (ecologically), how can we  seriously expect it to do so when there's a collapse coming?

There  are some things humans simply can't fix. Things like poverty, war, or  widespread mental illness and substance abuse. We can help in specific  cases , but we can't eliminate the general problem. It's like this with  climate change and the wider environmental problem. We can reduce  emissions in some manner, in some places. We eradicated CFCs. But the  only thing that's going to stop industrialised civilisation in general  from emitting greenhouse gases and generally screwing up the ecosystem  is industrialised civilisation stopping. Or at least getting a lot  smaller.

If this is true – if we  really can't stop climate change – then what is the point in continuing  to pretend we can? What do we have to lose, in the long run, by  proclaiming publicly that we believe it is already too late?

If  this is true, then sooner or later this is going to be widely  understood, and our public discourse and politics will have to change to  reflect it. This may be extremely uncomfortable, but surely if it is  unavoidable, there is no benefit in delaying the point where it is  widely understood.",environment,1578569615,anthropoz,166,1,True,2020-01-09 06:33:35

Analysis: Is #TeamTrees a Sustainable Way to Combat Climate Change?,"On October 25th, the Youtuber Mr.Beast posted a video on explaining his plan to raise 20 million dollars to plant 20 million trees by the 1st of January 2020. This idea was incepted by Mr Beast’s subscribers over various social media platforms as a celebration for reaching the major milestone of 20 million subscribers. Mr Beast accepted the challenge and teamed up with Mark Rober to start the #teamtrees project. 

This ambitious endeavour has necessitated the largest YouTube collaboration in history; notable mentions including: Smarter every day, Linus tech tips, slow mo guys, iJustine, Marques brownlee, Alan becker, Jeffree Star and many more. With only 2 months to complete the challenge the team and many other content creators published tons of content to promote the movement, which has since gained huge traction, amassing 14 million dollars in the first 14 days.

One of the largest donations of $1,000,000 was made on the 4th day of the campaign, from Elon Musk of Tesla and Space X. This was followed up the next day by a $1,000,001 donation from Tobias Lütke CEO of Shopify, who was not about to be out done by Elon \[1\]. Of course many other celebrity figures also donated.

Obviously these are a scratch on the bank balance of some of these donors; but it is great to see such a positive contribution from many key influencers, as the message from #teamtrees is arguably much more significant than the trees themselves. But let's look into this in more detail. What is the social and environmental impact of #teamtrees?

It is estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half, since the start of human civilisation \[2\]. Deforestation increases carbon-dioxide levels as there are less trees to absorb CO2 and when the products made from trees get burned or disposed of they release their carbon back to the environment. but planting them could store away some of the carbon we’ve put in the atmosphere.

The teamtrees project has partnered with Arbor Day Foundation, a non-government-organisation that has been planting trees in North America and around the world for the last 47 years. In fact they are the oldest tree planting NGO who focus on planting and maintaining native species in public forest-lands managed by government agencies; so as to not disrupt local biodiversity. Their motto is “to plant the right trees, in the right place, at the right time, for the right reasons.” 

This is in contrast to other recent tree planting efforts, who although virtuous in intention, may be harming local wildlife. This is due to planting primarily mono-culture plantations of trees, but more on that in a minute. 

Globally there has never been more ambition and action in planting trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square km of forest by 2030, this is almost as big an area as the entire European Union \[3\]. The target, superficially at least, looks likely to be achieved. However, “tree planting is not always good” according to Simon Lewis, Global change science UCL. This is because the motives for planting trees are not always green. Remember the mono-culture plantations we mentioned earlier? They are large tree planting efforts where thousands of hectares is planted with a single species of tree. Currently half of the government tree planting pledges involve short rotation, monoculture plantations \[2\].

Short rotation means that they are planting trees with polluting fertiliser to speed up growth so they can be harvested for greater commercial value.  The most common trees planted in tree planting projects are eucalyptus, oil palm and pine; which produce very lucrative raw materials, most of which is exported to developed countries, leaving behind the true value of the resource: ecological degradation, depleted soil, pesticide contaminated water,  and an exploited native population. Monoculture plantations of these trees suffocate biodiversity. In addition, evergreen species like eucalyptus take up ground water all year round leading to dry earth and increased risk of forest fires \[4\]. For instance, in January in Chile in 2017, 600,000 hectares of tree plantations, native forests and other lands went up into flames as a result of prolonged periods of drought in the widespread monoculture pine plantations. Causing 11 fatalities and massive social and economic harm, the Chilean fires provided further evidence that monoculture tree plantations undermine a regions climate resilience. They are highly susceptible to fire, pests, and storm damage. They also erode the soils, suppress plant and animal biodiversity, and deplete and contaminate water resources. When they cut down for resource value, the exposure of lose depleted soil promotes desertification and increases the risks of landslides \[4\]. Hence, studies show that harvested plantations only store 1/40th of the carbon natural forests do. However, making and disposing of products made from harvested trees is simply returning that small amount of carbon saved back into the atmosphere. \[2\]

This takes us to the point that plantations are not forests, and not all trees planting efforts are beneficial to the environment; sadly many of them are harmful but win government and public funding, largely due to the growing support of climate policies which can be deceitful satisfied on paper through monoculture plantations whilst profiting from the resources harvested. If you’d like more details please see the videos by the economist and ecosia linked in the description.  

The world is currently in love with the idea of planting trees. However, as noble as the notion is we must be truthful about what our impacts really are otherwise we will not see any real changes. An article published in “Science” last July estimated the total global tree cover potential \[5a\]. The results show there is space for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of forest cover, which if allowed to mature could store an optimistic 205 Gton of carbon. This computational result assumed large areas of land which is not suitable for forest growth; and was corrected by a different study, to a more realistic 42 Gton of carbon \[5b\]. Of course this is still a significant amount of carbon. In fact it is enough to sequester all of the carbon emitted in 2010 \[6\]. Of course we are emitting more and more greenhouse gasses each year and there is only finite space to plant trees to remove these gases. Additionally, we still have to allow the forests to mature, which could take 3-4 decades. But this only emphasises the urgency to act. This is a prediction of the carbon dioxide emissions with associated temperature rise for the most aggressive climate response from the IPCC in their special report “Global Warming of 1.5°C”. Ultimately, “Ecological restoration, if carefully implemented, can have a role in mitigating climate change, it is no substitute for the fact that most fossil fuel emissions will need to stop to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement”.

If our current climate policy pledges are upheld, then by the year 2050 we can expect a 3.0 degree Celsius increase in average global temperature; which is considered insufficient by the ‘Climate Action Tracker’ \[7\]. This would cause the sea level to raise up to 0.3 m \[6\] damaging coastal city infrastructure as well as habitat loss for fish and coastal species. As rising sea level coincides with more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons, unpredictable natural disasters will become more frequent. Which are already starting to occur and cause migration away from disaster affected regions. In fact the first of 2019 alone saw the displacement of a record 7 million people due to natural disasters; nearly twice that of conflicts in the same period \[8\].

This is not to say that planting trees is a bad thing. Tree plantations are environmentally harmful, but regeneration of natural forests is an effective way to increase climate resilience and biodiversity, as well as reducing climate change through CO2 absorption. But planting forests is hard; and it doesn’t produce much economical profit. But it's one of the best ways we can combat climate change. So next time a tree planting effort asks for your support, ask them “are you planting mixed forests or monocultures?”. As far as we can tell the Arbor Day foundation are not planting commercial monoculture plantations, and some of their projects are mixed species forests.

International government intervention is the most effective way to combat climate, however, we have yet to see any significant global action from any government. Regardless, the most important takeaway from TeamTrees is that large government action is not the only way to tackle climate change. Is it possible within the public sphere through small donations from large numbers of individuals who care about the future, to sway public opinion, gather funds and make a real impact on the global climate.

Although the numerical impact of #teamtress is likely small,  this project is a powerful gesture supporting the climate change movement and raising awareness. This will undoubtedly sow the seeds for future large scale, public sector driven climate action. We would like to congratulate TeamTrees for achieving their goal, and for proving that the ability to regenerate our climate is within every individuals’ power. The challenge now for each of us is to maintain the momentum and keep searching for sustainable ways to clean up our environment.

Analysis: Is #TeamTrees a Sustainable Way to Combat Climate Change?,"On October 25th, the Youtuber Mr.Beast posted a video on explaining his plan to raise 20 million dollars to plant 20 million trees by the 1st of January 2020. This idea was incepted by Mr Beast’s subscribers over various social media platforms as a celebration for reaching the major milestone of 20 million subscribers. Mr Beast accepted the challenge and teamed up with Mark Rober to start the #teamtrees project. 

This ambitious endeavour has necessitated the largest YouTube collaboration in history; notable mentions including: Smarter every day, Linus tech tips, slow mo guys, iJustine, Marques brownlee, Alan becker, Jeffree Star and many more. With only 2 months to complete the challenge the team and many other content creators published tons of content to promote the movement, which has since gained huge traction, amassing 14 million dollars in the first 14 days.

One of the largest donations of $1,000,000 was made on the 4th day of the campaign, from Elon Musk of Tesla and Space X. This was followed up the next day by a $1,000,001 donation from Tobias Lütke CEO of Shopify, who was not about to be out done by Elon \[1\]. Of course many other celebrity figures also donated.

Obviously these are a scratch on the bank balance of some of these donors; but it is great to see such a positive contribution from many key influencers, as the message from #teamtrees is arguably much more significant than the trees themselves. But let's look into this in more detail. What is the social and environmental impact of #teamtrees?

It is estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half, since the start of human civilisation \[2\]. Deforestation increases carbon-dioxide levels as there are less trees to absorb CO2 and when the products made from trees get burned or disposed of they release their carbon back to the environment. but planting them could store away some of the carbon we’ve put in the atmosphere.

The teamtrees project has partnered with Arbor Day Foundation, a non-government-organisation that has been planting trees in North America and around the world for the last 47 years. In fact they are the oldest tree planting NGO who focus on planting and maintaining native species in public forest-lands managed by government agencies; so as to not disrupt local biodiversity. Their motto is “to plant the right trees, in the right place, at the right time, for the right reasons.” 

This is in contrast to other recent tree planting efforts, who although virtuous in intention, may be harming local wildlife. This is due to planting primarily mono-culture plantations of trees, but more on that in a minute. 

Globally there has never been more ambition and action in planting trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square km of forest by 2030, this is almost as big an area as the entire European Union \[3\]. The target, superficially at least, looks likely to be achieved. However, “tree planting is not always good” according to Simon Lewis, Global change science UCL. This is because the motives for planting trees are not always green. Remember the mono-culture plantations we mentioned earlier? They are large tree planting efforts where thousands of hectares is planted with a single species of tree.

 The governor of Kansas said on Thursday that she’d likely sign a bill to legalize marijuana in the state if lawmakers sent one to her desk.

In a pair of TV interviews looking at her legislative priorities for 2020, Gov. Laura Kelly (D) said the legislature needs to approve medical cannabis, which she argued would help families with children who have serious illnesses and also combat the opioid crisis.

But while the governor said she isn’t “going to advocate for” broader recreational legalization, that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t enact such legislation if it advanced in the state.

“I haven’t really decided what I would do. This is something where what the people want is probably more what I will want on something like that,” Kelly told WIBW. “I don’t have a personal ideology regarding it. If the folks want it and the legislature passes it, would I sign it? Probably.”

 

The governor of Kansas said on Thursday that she’d likely sign a bill to legalize marijuana in the state if lawmakers sent one to her desk.

But while the governor said she isn’t “going to advocate for” broader recreational legalization, that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t enact such legislation if it advanced in the state.

“I haven’t really decided what I would do. This is something where what the people want is probably more what I will want on something like that,” Kelly told WIBW. “I don’t have a personal ideology regarding it. If the folks want it and the legislature passes it, would I sign it? Probably.”

**Watch Kelly’s comments on marijuana legalization below:**

Again, however, she stressed that it’s the more focused legalization of cannabis for medical purposes that is part of her personal agenda for the 2020 session.

“I have always said that I want it well-regulated so that it’s controlled so that it’s not the first step to legalization of marijuana,” the governor [said](https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Medicaid-marijuana-top-Kansas-governors-2020-priorities-566665261.html). “I don’t want that. I want it to be seen as a pharmaceutical and controlled as we do that.”

“I do believe that medical marijuana needs to be legalized,” she added. “It does have medical uses, and I think it would do a lot for our families who have these kids with Dravet syndrome, which is that severe, frequent epileptic seizures, and I also think that it would help with the opioid crisis.”

Kelly has repeatedly been on the record voicing support for medical marijuana, including as part of her [election campaign in 2018](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-in-the-governors-mansion-record-number-of-candidates-say-legalize-it/), but her concession that she’d sign off on adult-use legalization is notable. And while she said that doesn’t “think Kansas is ready to go there” with the more far-reaching policy change, a recent poll indicates that most state residents are in fact ready.

The annual Kansas Speaks survey, released last month, showed that [63 percent of Kansans are in favor of adult-use marijuana legalization](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/legalizing-marijuana-has-majority-support-in-kansas-poll-finds/). [https://globalmarijuanadispensary.com/shop/kush-mints/](https://globalmarijuanadispensary.com/shop/kush-mints/) 

With that, it appears the only thing that remains to be seen is whether the legislature will pass a legalization bill and send it to Kelly’s desk.

For now, however, the prospects look good for at least enacting some form of medical cannabis legalization in the state. A special legislative commission issued [recommendations](https://www.kcur.org/post/no-smoking-kansas-medical-marijuana-push-aims-edibles-and-topicals#stream/0) last year in support of establishing a limited medical marijuana program that would allow patients to access products that can’t be smoked or vaped. It also said patients visiting from out of state should be afforded some legal protections.

“I’m fully aware of the desire that people have for the legalization of medical marijuana,” Kelly [said](https://www.ksnt.com/capitol-bureau/governor-kelly-prepares-for-2020-legislative-session/) in a separate interview with KSNT. “I support it and I hope the legislature deals with it.”",environment,1578612616,GregJones003,0,1,True,2020-01-09 18:30:16

How to prove beyond reasonable doubt anthropogenic climate change?,"I was having a debate with someone about climate change and they started going oh it's all a hoax the usual. After some.more conversation they trot out the usual lines of we don't know about temperatures more than 150 years, measurement of co2 is not accurate. Then they trotted out the Dr Tim ball stuff where he implies that water vapour is the most prominent green house gas at over 90% and man made co2 is only a tiny fraction of the remaining 5% of green house gases that is co2.

It is hard to argue these kinds of things and make me question my self over the reality of the issue. 

Could someone point to definitive reading that disproves these claims and helps me gain a correct understanding of anthropogenic impact.

One of them is the co2 ppm over time which puts at odds the Tim ball claim. It's never been above 400 ppm in the last million years. Meaning total co2 in the atmosphere has to have a much larger anthropogenic contribution?

2.	If you do, did it influence your decision? 
3.	Why did you research the country of production of the solar panels?
4.	(if you were not aware of the country of production) If you knew the country of production beforehand, would you reconsider buying the solar panels/ would it influence your decision? 
5.	How did you choose what solar panel company to buy from? Did you research the company and where they get their solar panels from? 
6.	Does it matter if your solar panels are imported from another country, or do you prefer the country of production to be the same as your home country? 
7.	Did you research the company of the solar panels? Do you care if the company is lying to you about the price, since it affects you? 
8.	Quality and price: are those factors that influence your decision which company you buy from? 
9.	Are you aware how the solar panels are produced? ( Do you care if it’s not environmentally friendly, ex: in China the production is not very environmentally friendly) 
10.	Do you care if the solar panels are made in an environmentally-friendly environment?
11.	Do you know what kind of solar panels you own?

I need a second opinion on this startup,"This company's video came up as an ad on youtube. I watched through all of it. I was appalled.

I invite you to have a look for yourself before reading my comments.

[Rebo-Smart-Bottle Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rebo-smart-bottle-clean-the-planet-as-you-drink#/)

Many things seem to be off about this startup and especially its business model:

* Why Smart bottles when the solution is simply to buy a stainless steel bottle for 20 bucks and donate the rest directly to a waste picking organization
* Picking up one bottle everytime a person drinks. I have so many issues with this. How much are they gonna donate per sip? Won't the number of sips times the price of a sip exceed their profits after a while? Or are they just hoping the sensors will stop working after a while. 
* They mentioned the blockchain, which screams: RED FLAG. Why use such an infrastructure when all they are doing is counting the number of times people are flipping bottles on their vertical axis and sending a sum of money that is proportional to that count to nonprofits 
* To top it, in the comments on Indiegogo, they said that they are planning to build an AI detection system to prevent 'fake drinking'. 

It's tragic in my opinion because they have managed to raise around 100k CHF from people who are probably very well intentioned and who have been led to believe that they contributed to some positive change in the world. This leads me to ask the following question: Shouldn't we be even more careful when it comes to supporting companies that advertise themselves as sustainable given that we are naturally inclined to be more receptive to their ideas?

Water Cycle is WRONG it needs HELIUM for HYDROGEN/OXYGEN COLD FUSION! -269°c,"SOS SOS 
Its 1am in USA and I dont know who to call.
I was working on a design for solar energy Desalinization and I was attempting to find the problem with the Water Cycle to figure out why it's not raining.. 

I saw the evaporation on land and it reminded me of GAS. I searched the periodic table to find what gas could be bubbling up.. and then I saw it..

Helium. It has no known purpose. But nothing in the earths soil is there for no purpose everything has a process. 

Helium doesnt interact with ANY Substance it goes up up up and out. 

But helium and hydrogen can bond as a liquid at the right temperature.

Surrounding the exosphere the last part of the atmosphere before space, we have molecules of hydrogen and helium and oxygen.

Hydrogen liquifies at -254°c 

Helium liquifies at -269.4°c

Temp of Space -270°c

So if hydrogen is liquid a bubble of helium could enter it and float it up to where Helium becomes liquid and the Oxygen molecules all together set off cold FUSION at -269°c 

At which point 2HYDROGEN AND 2OXYGEN fusion bond by the force of helium exit. Turning into a LIQUID.... RAIN! And it falls back down with the gravity of earth.

Helium is expelled naturally by decay of radioactive materials. It is stuck in the soil. 

Which is why we just had a major earthquake in puerto rico 5 days ago and now we are have major weather events coast to coast in USA. 

I bet if the tracked earthquakes they'd find the same pattern in RAIN

I think we need to TURN THE SOIL maybe 20ft down the location of the usual water table, where theres some moisture. That is where helium can be released. 

Check for weather events NW, after earthquakes to confirm!!!!

Australia’s fires have pumped out more emissions than 100 nations combined,"The situation: The wildfires raging along Australia’s eastern coast have already pumped around 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further fueling the climate change that’s already intensifying the nation’s fires, reports James Temple.

In perspective: That’s more than the total combined annual emissions of the 116 lowest-emitting countries. It also adds up to about three-quarters of Australia’s otherwise flattening greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019. Although it isn’t an unprecedented amount at this point of the year in Australia, emissions are way beyond typical levels in New South Wales, where this year’s fires are concentrated.

A vicious feedback loop: Rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall dries out trees, plants, and soil, amplifying fires when they break out. In turn, these huge fires are fueling climate change. [Read the full story](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615035/australias-fires-have-pumped-out-more-emissions-than-100-nations-combined/).

There is currently a public input period for President Trump’s announced rollback of the environmental permitting process for construction projects. These include three main changes: 1) No longer including climate change in the permitting process. 2) Streamlining the permitting process by having a lead agency and deadlines. And 3) Exempting some projects with limited government involvement from the environmental permitting process.

"13th JANUARY, 81 YEARS AGO WAS KNOWN AS ‘BLACK FRIDAY’ - AUSTRALIA"," 

https://preview.redd.it/49xefnmdyma41.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5fef93872dc188f6f91cdcd7183e6e51a504da

On this day, Eighty-one years ago (13th Jan 1939) with temperatures above 110°F (45°C) across Victoria and the state in drought, bushfires consumed 3,700 buildings across the state, 71 lives were lost and 5 towns completely destroyed- never to be rebuilt.

The Royal Commission into ‘’Black Friday’’ concluded;

“There had been no fires to equal these in destructiveness or intensity in the history of settlement in this State, except perhaps the fires of 1851, which, too, came at summer culmination of a long drought.

‘’At midday, in many places, it was dark as night. Men carrying hurricane lamps, worked to make safe their families and belongings Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees, and perished. Throughout the land there was daytime darkness’.’

“The speed of the fires was appalling. They leaped from mountain peak to mountain peak, or far out into the lower country, lighting the forests 6 or 7 miles in advance of the main fires. Blown by a wind of great force, they roared as they travelled. Balls of crackling fire sped at a great pace in advance of the fires, consuming with a roaring, explosive noise, all that they touched.‘’

‘’On that day it appeared that the whole State was alight.”

NB : Every child in every Australian school should be taught about the events of ‘Black Friday’ 1939 to give them an understanding and appreciation of the extreme danger of the Australian bush.

However keeping them ignorant of Australia’s bushfire history makes it far easier to radicalise them and recruit them into the Climate Cult.

As Orwell noted;

“The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”",environment,1578960406,ThingsInMyRoom,2,1,True,2020-01-13 19:06:46

[Snickerdoodles and Shortbreads by Morris Stuttard, Booked by Nabiel](https://discord.gg/dwPj3u3)

All the best for the new year, all.

SNICKERDOODLES &amp; SHORTBREADS

by Morris Stuttard. Story booked by [u/Nabiel](https://www.reddit.com/u/Nabiel/)

“Me? Christmas was more the stuff we did. Playing Nat King Cole while decoratin’ the tree. Helping Ma make snickerdoodles and shortbreads. Grandpops with the same joke on repeat—telling us to look at the baubles on the tree; said they were crystal balls and if ya looked into ‘em, you’d see how fat you’ll be once Christmas is gone done.

“And Pops would tell me it was my job to make mistletoe. The ingredients were the same every year: apple trees, a ladder, secateurs, and a boy still too young to fear death by fallin’.

“I never told him that each year I was more afraid to go up those trees than I was the last. By sixteen I was darn-near terrified. ‘Got some christmas spice this year, Tye—damn gale’s a blowing out there,’ Pops said before we went out.

“There weren’t no berries on the apple-tree mistletoe that year so Pops sent me up an oak—a tall straight one whose lowest branches were still four men high. I remember—the old tree weren’t swaying that day, the thing was flapping when I climbed it. And wi’ me way up there, clipping away in a fury at the sprigs of mistletoe like I were Denzel Scissorhands or some god damn... And the sprigs of mistletoe dropped down and went bouncing across the field in the wind, with pops chasing em down, shouting up that I’d done good, and all the while both my hands shaking more than grandpops’ cigarette during overtime in a Cowboys game. But I got the damn mistletoe.

“And we had white Christmases sometimes too—not like here—and we all went sledding down Truman Hill. Went so damn far and fast one time that I had to jump off before I hit the river. We spent the next half hour trying to fish the thing out of the water with them metal rods that poke out of concrete.”

“Rebars,” comes Luca’s twang from inside his tent, the glow of his phone screen floating supernaturally behind the blue nylon. “They’re called rebars to those that know.”

A silence lingers as Tye lets his thoughts wander more. He heaves out a clouded sigh. “Wonder if Ma and Pops think about the Christmases when they were kids, or the Christmases when we were.”

A silence more.

Until Tye finishes his thought. “Christmas is only fun when you’re a littl’un. Ain’t meant for grown ups. Not more than facilitatin’ anyways.”

None of the line of huddled men and women on the street say anything to disagree. But rarely do they say anything when it’s this cold. Conversation is for summer when you’re on the street.

There is movement at last from Tye’s right. Old Cody lifts his Santa hat from his eyes but doesn’t go as far as to open them. ""That’s the first time I heard you say a single nice thing about your pops.""

Tye spits so hard through his teeth that it nearly hits some high-heeled boots trotting by on the sidewalk.

“That’s the first time I heard him say anything nice ‘bout *anyone*,” adds Luca.

“Show me someone worth talking nice about and I’ll sing ‘em a damn song,” says Tye, and he wipes a dripping nose on the back of his mittens.

More people shuffle by, spattering the sheltered section of San Francisco sidewalk with brown water from the icy rain. Cardboard shopping bags from designer stores clack against each other like ducks on the run. The murmur of people on the phone is as constant as the jammed cars in the street beyond.

One pair of wool-suited legs and sheeny black shoes ostensibly steps aside to let a girl move past the pole of scaffolding first. He treads on Tye’s trouser leg.

“Sorry, buddy. Didn’t see you there.”

Tye narrows eyes. “Not what you say to us on the street, ‘buddy’.”

And the man moves on, pretending not to hear what he had already failed to see.

“What d’you get like that for? The guy apologised, didn’t he?” growls Cody as he pulls the hat back over his eyes. “You’re not going to make ‘em notice us any more talking up like that.” And he gives the sorry cup of mostly-quarters in his hand a single shake to make his complaint more specific.

“I tried being nice last Wednesday.” Tye turns on his side and goes to pull his sleeping bag over some apparently unassailable cold spot near his collar. But the moment he moves his shoulder, the top of the cover slips and his exposed neck gets another gust of Christmas Eve wind.

He tries again. But again the cover slips down. Furious, Tye leaps up from his mound of clothes and covers so suddenly it’s like a monster from a mound of leaves. The latest constipation of shoppers veer away from him. Glances swim past as he stands at their level—some furtive, others challenging. Cody lifts both hat and eyelids this time.

But Tye just turns his back on the passers by and reaches up for a high-neck fleece hanging to dry on a scaffolding pole. Centimetres behind is a designer showroom where plastic figures wear clothes of a quality Tye has never even felt between his fingers. The original turquoise of his fleece now better matches the colour of the Bay in torchlight, and it’s clearly flacid with wetness even before his fingers rub it to check.

“I swear these windows were heated yesterday.”

“Maybe shouldn’t a hung your shorts up there, like I told ya,” comes Luca’s squawk again.

“Where the goddam else am I going to hang ‘em, huh?”

The tent unzips and Luca’s neolithic arrow-head of a nose pokes out, illuminated by the phone he is playing on. “You see. There are certain inconveniences to being homeless, Tye. Certain things you have to go without… Like heated hanging rails.”

Tye turns and walks off.

“Hey! Where you going? Get me a coffee!”

But Tye is already embedded in the sea of shoppers, who part almost biblically, keeping half a metre away from him at all sides. He shouts loud over the honking horns of traffic—to everyone and to no one. “I’m done freezing out here! I ain’t no dog. And ain’t no dog should be freezin’ like this neither.” With that, he walks right off the sidewalk, weaving through the static congestion of mostly yellow cars, sending up more horn honks into the skyscraper-walled cavern of the business district street.

Cody is watching with both eyes now as Tye reaches the other side of the road

“Where’s that fool goin’ now?” asks Luca, straining from his tent to see.

Cody sees Tye stomping towards a policeman on the other side of the road, who is typing out a ticket on a small device in his hand. Tye pulls off the mitten of his right hand as he gets near.

“I think he’s gone hunting for a warm cell.”

The policeman, smaller than Tye in height and shoulder, looks up just as Tye is in full swing—a slap so wide-arcing and so straight-elbowed that Charlie Chaplin would have clapped.

SPAK!—grubby open palm hits cold, wet and raw cheek.

When the policeman’s face returns forward, his eyes are a fury.

Tye turns his wrists upwards and gives the policeman a look of ‘Well? Arrest me.’

And gets a fist hard in the nose. He goes down as quickly as moments ago he jumped up, clutching it.

“Try that again and I’ll shoot your damn ass off,” shouts the policeman so loudly that Cody can hear it even over the honking cars and Luca in full hysterics beside him.

The policeman finishes booking the car and keeps walking. Tye hauls himself up to a crouch. The more human of the passers by flinch to help, only to realise their hands will get dirty and so keep their help to a flinch. A young suit with a preened beard and fur-neck coat wills him to get back on his feet with awkward hands and sorry eyes. Tye does, and shakes off the hands that aren’t touching him, before stomping back across the sea of taxis to the corridor of scaffolding-covered homelessness.

“Broke my nose. That’s police brutality right there. Did anyone get a video?” He says as he staggers back to his spot.

“You... hit him first.” Luca is still laughing so hard his tent is shaking.

“That was just to get arrested. Ow.” And Tye drops back onto his stack of clothes and cardboard.

A wet fleece falls on Tye’s head like an oversized flannel. Even Cody chuckles at this.

“I’m done with this city.”

“Not before the city’s done wi’ you,” says Cody. And he pulls the white rim of his Santa hat back over his eyes as if submerging into a warm bath.

Tye spits blood into the space between his shoes and leans back—part exhaustion and part so that the blood will run back into his nose not out.

“I’m done.”

It’s then that something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Two people are distinct from the hurried stream of evening shoppers. Unlike everyone else, they are not going anywhere. They are stopped, and what is more, looking at the line of hunched men and women beneath the scaffolding in their cardboard boxes, tents or, like Tye, buried in leaf-heaps of discarded clothes. Looking at them individually.

A middle-aged lady, delicate, elegant and thin-boned—like an Audrey Hepburn taking late afternoon tea at Tiffany’s—bows down so that she may hear what her nine year old son is saying. The boy stands tall and straight like a miniature president, with brown hair neatly quiffed even where it protrudes from his high-fashion trappers’ hat. The two appear to be gradually moving along the line of strewn men and women, discussing each in turn. It is almost as if they were window-shopping, except they are not looking into the stores at all but at the people huddled in the windows’ light before them.

As they get closer, Tye can hear them.

“I’ll know when I see, Mom.”

“Okay, but we have already ‘seen’ a good many, dear… At least a type? You have a type you’re looking for perhaps?” The mother speaks with an accent so refinedly British it verges on caricature.

“Mrs Jennings says it’s rude to talk about people as types,” replies the boy, still looking at the row as he goes.

“Yes. Well. What distinguishing features, then?”

“Him,” says the boy. He is pointing directly at Tye now, who has just finished depositing two twisted knots of tissue into each nostril.

The mother smiles at Tye then leads her son out of earshot. All Tye can think about is how wonderfully smooth her skin seems.

He watches her lips and thinks she is saying something to her son about Tye being a black man. Or perhaps he is imagining it.

The boy just nods and looks up at his mother. His face stoney with decision. The mother lays a hand on his shoulder and nods an okay, before returning to Tye and bending down respectfully to his level. Cody and Luca are all ears and eyes now too.

“Hello there. I do hope we’re not bothering you…”

“It’s fine—begging kind of just happens.”

She gets the joke quickly. Not like most people he speaks to. And her teeth gleam in the store window’s light as she smiles. “What’s your name, might I ask?”

“Tyson. But they call me Tye.”

“Well, this is Jonathan. And I am Mrs Peterson. I hope you don’t mind my asking, but what happened to your nose? You were... fighting?”

Her effort to hide any judgment shows just how much judgment there actually is, eddying around her question.

“Fighting? Me! Ha! No. I only do hugs.”

His humour makes the truth more palatable and she smirks, eyes sparkling beyond the cosmetically-enhanced norm. Jonathan leaves her cashmere-jacketed side and steps forward.

“We want to invite you for Christmas lunch,” says Jonathan with impressive simplicity.

Her mother lays a flustered hand on his shoulder as if to steady his directness, and says with an almost angelic warmth, “Yes. It would be a great pleasure if you’d come.”

Tye just stares at them.

Mrs Peterson sees she clearly needs to do some explaining and gives a little cough as dainty as most people’s giggles.

“Erm. We’ll be entirely honest... I would love to say this offer comes only from the goodness of our hearts. But as well as wanting very much to give you a good meal, along with access to sanita... our bathroom facilities, and some new clothes, it would also be helping us. You see, Jonathan needs to demonstrate he is engaging with the community. For his university applications you understand.”

“He’s what, nine?”

“Exactly right. But the earlier the better—we don’t want the admissions people thinking he only did the said ‘engaging’ for the sake of his application, you-”

“-understand. Sure. Got it.” Tye eyes the boy, who is either compliant to the point of servility or actually genuinely wants this. “So let me get this straight—you want me to come to your house, have a bath... I get a bath right?”

“Yes.”

“And new clothes? And a meal?”

“New*ish* clothes, yes. Goose and all the trimmings too. Made by my own fair hands.” She gives a laugh like the shiver of a chandelier. “What do you say? Tomorrow at eleven thirty? We live on the top of 22nd street.”

Tye feels Cody and Luca’s eyes, and knows Luca is less than a second away from volunteering in his stead.

“Sure. Deal.”

“Splendid. Here’s our address.” She hands him a card from her neat little tan leather purse and smiles more pearls before straightening like a swan looking to the sky, and gliding with the boy off into the stream of shoppers. Jonathan turns and gives Tye a wave through a flurry of sleet.

Tye musters enough positivity to wave back. The kid smiles.

“And you say you don’t ever get no lucky break…” grumbles Luca.

“Not quite sure what this is,” says Tye, to everyone and no one.

“City ain’t done with you yet,” says Cody.

We should take example of students!,"Crazy  thought that started with tea 🍵 so i am someone who likes tea, but not  too strong. Equally, i hate to waste things. Hence when i make tea, i  use one tea bag to make several teas.

Now,  many people make fun of that and say it's from student days when you  had to watch your spending etc, but that got me thinking: if only  everyone lived like a student we could cut down on so much waste! When  we grow up we are told we need to grow and consume, and everyone forgets  to be mindful of their consumption and limited resources. They forget  to live in the moment and enjoy it, without the need to buy and waste  stuff just for the sake if it.

Ranting About Deniers,"Lately I've become quite upset at the amount of climate change deniers. It seems like anytime you talk about the climate now there's someone unqualified who's ready to tell you how wrong they believe you are. I'm fed up with this behavior.

Many deniers say that humans didn't cause climate change. That is the one of the saddest, shift the blame scenarios I have ever heard in my life. Let me ask them this: would you put your face in front of your car's exhaust pipe and just inhale it in? Would you sit in your closed garage while your motor runs and pumps all that waste into the space around you? That kind of thing would get you killed! What is the difference between doing that and pumping it into the air? Just because it flies away and you can't see it anymore doesn't mean it just goes away. It's dirty pollution! There's no way you can sit there and say that this isn't having an impact on the environment, not when there's 7 billion people on the planet and all of them need some form of transportation. Buses, trains, planes, trucks, all of these things burn that same nasty black smoke into the air. There's no way there isn't a repercussion from everyone pumping all that sickness into the air and it's insane to act like ""well humans didn't do that."" Bologni. Even if you could prove humans didn't cause this, climate change is still happening!

Then they just ignore all the images and videos of the disasters around us. Ice caps melt, the Amazon burns, Australia burns, areas flood, areas have famine. Don't worry though it's ""just another ice age"" or ""the planet has always changed"" or worse yet ""it's a tax evasion scheme."" Excuse me? There's a lot of wacky things going on in the environment and you want me to just sit back and say ""ah it's no big deal. Things will work themselves out."" Madness I tell you, pure madness. Even for the sake of argument, say 30 years down the road scientists' predictions were wrong and it's not as big a deal as it seems, why on Earth would you smack down anyone who wants to try and help the planet? Electric vehicles, solar panels, sustainable businesses, less plastic, less slaughterhouses, more trees, etc. etc. etc.

How could anyone normal, functioning human being turn that down? You can sit here and name a win win win scenario in so many ways and the deniers will challenge that. I just can't. Even if you take the title of climate change away, people will still fight it and resist it or say ""Well we're already reducing emissions."" They just pull these hypothetical, no data supported arguments right out of the wild, saying whatever fits the weird programmed agenda they have inside of them. That is not how an intelligent person is supposed to hold a conversation. You don't just say things, you don't just quote what you heard on tv because they have the money to be a major network. You don't just recycle what you watch on youtube or read just because an article was published. Adolf Hitler has a book, it doesn't mean that anything he did was justified at all. 

The environment is something that affects and protects us all and yet we destroy it and all the other creatures that rely on it. We've taken something that is integral to existence as we know it and wrapped it up into politics, one of the worst time wasting, human dividing things that have ever or will ever exist. It's become fused into this system of nonsense and now we all have to operate through this system of nonsense in order to save ourselves. Do you see how ridiculous this all is? I should never have to vote or try to persuade others to vote in order to save our planet. It shouldn't even be a factor on a ballot because it should be protected and nurtured regardless of anything else we battle over for as long as human beings shall live. The environment should take priority over anything else we have going on, period.

But here we are. Living in the US you hear all these magical words like ""bipartisanship"" and ""freedom"" and an assortment of things to make you believe the system works. Why is it so hard for people to work together? Is it really so bad if a Democrat or a Republican receded on a point and said ""well maybe I'm wrong"" or ""You're right. Let's try that."" I know these people have vested interests but where are the ones to value something more like, ya know, humanity? Any relationship you ever have with another human being has to come with compromise. You give, you take. Unfortunately the climate has ended up as one of those polarizing issues, one of those things where people are completely split on it. It's like a child caught in the middle of an ugly divorce and only one side is going to get full custody.

People act like it's so hard to hear another candidate and, Heaven forbid, change their mind. I'm trying to be open here but I still have no hope for the Republican party coming through on this end. Imagine how terrible this must make Republican believers feel. Their voices are shrouded by the nonsense that people like our President bellow. The Democrats can yell and kick and scream about Trump but it changes nothing. All this money wasted on slamming the president when it could've gone to anything more productive. Nancy Pelosi wastes all this energy trying to get Trump impeached when he'll never get evicted from the White House. All that money could be used on sustainability or renewable energy. 

And to what end does this all play out? People vote for Trump because they want to be loyal to party lines? Because he's a real ""man""? Because he makes the ""hard choices for us that we need""? How could a man who has proven himself to be sexist, racist, doesn't listen, abuses social media more than the ""millennials"" he cries about all the time, only concerned with self interests and his money, takes orders from another foreign leader, contradicts what he says daily, and is oddly explicit about the way he talks about his daughter, ever going to be right or true or helpful to a country of people who are supposed to be the 'big brother' of the planet? Trite.

Are you trying to save face to your friends? You know there's total privacy when voting right? It's not like all your work buddies or friends are watching you vote with a big tattoo on your head of who you pick. Is it loyalty? You pick a side and you stay there forever, no matter what? Is that what's important? People were loyal to Hitler too. Literally as the planet is dying, you stand there on your pedestal, bragging about how you helped saved the world for any old reason that hits home as the planet is being destroyed everywhere but your home first? That's the juxtaposition of humans. The world is crumbling, burning, flooding, and eating away at itself and the people who give up the power to the destroyers believe they are the ones who saved it. There are no words, no words with enough might to punch an indention of sense into a haven of stupidity like that. It's like congratulating cancer. It's like believing a gunshot to the head made you stronger. It's like saying that if I burn down my house then a mansion will appear. It's not magic, it's not up for debate, it has nothing to do with taxes or money. It's climate change, it's real, it's here and it is killing us.

Every time you gain a sliver of hope some malicious monster with a keyboard will dash everything you feel to ribbons. Greta is a 16 year old girl who has done more with her life than anyone I've seen her age. No matter how distraught she becomes at the situation, she remains civil. An endless number of message boards and forums across the internet say anything they can possibly construct to try and destroy her. They treat their words as if they are bullets and figure if they fire enough, one can finally reach her and destroy her cause. These are grown adults. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, aunts, uncles; all spewing the same evil rhetoric. And about a minor no less, a minor. She's old enough to know what she's doing but to deserve that kind of treatment and at her age no less is barbaric. Society would hunt down and rip apart anyone who ever spoke that way of an infant or a toddler. Anyone who so much as harms a baby in anyway will be punished by anyone with the hands to do it, even among prisoners there's enough of a code of honor to maintain that notion. Yet this is the reality. Because she is on the news, because she says what adults ignore or lie to themselves or illusion themselves against, it can someone be allowed to roast her. We see daily how the internet can be used as an instrument for mental torment and there are still people who throw their time and energy and use of their keyboards into not just fighting with but attempting to destroy who she is at a fundamental level. What has humanity created? This is worse than most things I've seen in fiction and they had a lot of real monsters and demons. 

I suppose that is the nature of a demon. It takes a form of the familiar and rots our intentions from the inside like a molding fruit. Decay, decay, decay, and then, disaster is all that's left. Human beings: creatures capable of such greatness, love, and creation are going to allow a select few to use their power and influence to brainwash us into evil, tiny tyrants that destroy. So distorted from the capabilities of who and what we could be into a shadow that could only faintly be made out to be human.

CA Paradise Fire cleanup: 2x the debris of World Trade Center attack,"The California Department of Resources Recycling &amp; Recovery (CalRecycle) cleared more than 3.66 million tons (7.3 billion lbs) of debris from the fire in Paradise, CA. [This is twice the amount of debris removed from the World Trade Center after 9/11](https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/blogs/in-the-loop/in-the-loop/2019/11/21/camp-fire-debris-removal-complete/). Due to the hazardous nature of the debris (burned homes, vehicles, and businesses), it requires disposal in landfills that can accept hazardous waste (not all are permitted for this). It took 305,000 truckloads to transport the debris, for a total of 28.2 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT)—the equivalent of 59 round trips to the moon. 

How much CO2 do you think was generated from all those truck trips to clear the waste from a fire that largely happened because of rising CO2? With each large fire or disaster, this has and will continue to happen. The waste must be removed because to leave it in place further contaminates water, soil, and air, but environmental disaster debris removal itself contributes significant environmental harm.",environment,1578198595,SterilizeHumans,0,12,True,2020-01-04 23:29:55

Total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the carbon dioxide emissions attributed to the country in which they physically occur. There are five sources: 

1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the oxidation of coal. 

2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the oxidation of oil. 

3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the oxidation of gas. 

4. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of vented natural gas and the venting of CO2 in the oil and gas industry converting methane into carbon dioxide. 

5. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from chemical reactions in the manufacture of cement.

Reasons Behind Environmental Data Vacuum &amp; Importance of Data,"**The definition of data is any type of information, statistics, or facts collected for research and analysis. In a very dynamic domain such as Environmental Monitoring where the climate or ambient air quality conditions are dependent on multiple variables, the environmental data collection is of utmost importance. It is through this environmental monitoring that scientists/researchers will be able to provide answers to problems related to deteriorating environmental conditions. This will in turn help in making informed decisions and analyze new insights backed by scientific data.**

**In the current scenario, You look at the internet for the environment data but don’t find sufficient data to analyze the change. That’s an environmental data vacuum – the absence of environmental data.**

### Why is that?

**Environmental data is generated through environmental monitoring. And the data scarcity is due to insufficient ambient monitoring for collecting enough data and processing it to generate useful information. Of course, we have weather stations installed at strategic locations, but they only monitor weather parameters like temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation amounts for weather prediction and forecasting. They do not provide information about pollution – their concentration, sources, and distribution, and hence, the need for environmental monitoring.**

Why does anybody still (say they) believe we can stop climate change?,"Doubtless this has been asked before. Sorry for the duplication.

We have known climate change was an existential threat to industrialised civilisation for over 30 years now. It has become apparent in recent years that the threat had been underestimated. And yet greenhouse emissions are still rising, the population is still rising, and we have made no progress whatsoever in making systemic changes. For example, though the UK government has accepted climate change is a serious threat to civilisation and must be stopped, it nevertheless decided, after very lengthy deliberations, that it is necessary to expand Heathrow Airport. The reason is that if this doesn't happen, the Dutch will expand their capacity and threaten Heathrow's position as the most important aviation hub in Europe. This is madness. Unfortunately, it is also reality. 

We are not going to stop climate change. Even if we did everything humanly possible to stop it, there's probably 3 to 4 degrees “baked into the cake”. And the politics says we won't do everything possible. This isn't about ""should"" or ""shoudn't"". It's about ""won't"".

This is about global co-operation, or the impossibility of it. We have no hope of even getting one major sovereign state to agree internally to the sort of sacrifices neeed (banning cheap air travel, limiting population growth, etc....). But to actually stop the eco-catastrophe, we'd have to get all the major sovereign states to agree between them to make those sacrifices. This is pure fantasy. It can't happen in the real world. On the contrary – in the difficult times to come, what is actually going to take place is a desperate fight for survival, at all sorts of levels. If the human race couldn't get together to sort out its differences during the “good times” (ecologically), how can we seriously expect it to do so when there's a collapse coming? 

There are some things humans simply can't fix. Things like poverty, war, or widespread mental illness and substance abuse. We can help in specific cases , but we can't eliminate the general problem. It's like this with climate change and the wider environmental problem. We can reduce emissions in some manner, in some places. We eradicated CFCs. But the only thing that's going to stop industrialised civilisation in general from emitting greenhouse gases and generally screwing up the ecosystem is industrialised civilisation stopping. Or at least getting a lot smaller. 

If this is true – if we really can't stop climate change – then what is the point in continuing to pretend we can? What do we have to lose, in the long run, by proclaiming publicly that we believe it is already too late? 

If this is true, then sooner or later this is going to be widely understood, and our public discourse and politics will have to change to reflect it. This may be extremely uncomfortable, but surely if it is unavoidable, there is no benefit in delaying the point where it is widely understood",environment,1578351161,anthropoz,6,1,True,2020-01-06 17:52:41

How The Australian Bushfires Has Affected Me,"I'm from Sydney and I thought that I'd share how my experience with the bushfires has went so that those outside of Australia (or even those outside of the bushfire areas but still in Australia, say Perth for example) will know what it feels like. (If not bothered reading scroll down to TL;DR).

Now, I live in the city and have thankfully not had any property destroyed, neither has my relatives. However the bushfires have affected my health. I am borderline asthmatic and I cough when I forget to have my enhaler every day and night. Now you might think that the effects will be small, but trust me, they're not.

When the bushfires kept on coming very prominently (around late November early December) I kept on coughing my lungs out, even indoors. Whenever I went outside (which I had to in order to go to the doctors for several certificates for school), I would always have to cover my mouth and when I forgot to my coughing was bad. Once it even felt like something in my chest was wrong, like it was changing or something, but thankfully I got in the car so nothing bad happened.

And outside it was bad, as you know there was a huge smog outside like it was China or something. But some of you might not know that there was ash FALLING FROM THE SKY, like RAIN DROPS but ASH. This was made even worse by the fact that it doesn't rain often in Australia (even in winter), because I remember when I was little it would rain once every week, occasionally every two weeks but now we always have to wait a few weeks, like 3 for rain (at least where I live). So, the ash kept on falling for a while until rain finally came to save us all.

And because of the smog and ash and my asthma issues I wasn't able to go to school a lot at the end of the year, and kept on getting picked up early when my parents did (because 9 times out of 10 the smog seemed to clear up, only for another bushfire to occur). Because of this, at the end of the year I was called in to discuss my attendance with a bunch of others (I know quite a few people who turned up even less then I did at the end of the year), and although they said it was because of my attendance on Thursdays where sport is held, I personally find that bullshit because I know I've shown up often for Thursdays until the end of the year, so I know what that meeting really was about.

And now I find out that in Sydney at least, the smog is getting into our tap water so we can't drink it. We can still use it for hygiene purposes apparently (even though I find that bullshit), but because we can't drink it we have to rely on fridge water from old tap water from a few months ago, and when that runs out bottled water. And I'm against bottled water too which makes this worse!

The worse part is that idiots like my parents are STILL defending Scomo for some reason, saying that ""it's not because of climate change"" and that ""he's doing the best he can"". I get that some fires started because of stupid idiots either lighting them on purpose (some kids mind you) or people not following fire bans, but this all happened due to climate change that Australia contributed to. In fact, my parents rely on coal. And because not only am I a minor who lives with them, but I'm financially dependent on them too, I'm stuck with coal as well. I wish I could use renewables and one day afford a Telsa :(

So the bushfires have affected everyone, not just those who have lost their homes, although I wish them good luck and I wish I had the money to donate to the RFS. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!

TL;DR: Although I haven't lost my home I have borderline asthma and the bushfires affected my health BAD. It affected me so much that I wasn't able to go to school, and the bushfires had such an effect on our environment that ash kept on falling from the sky until it eventually rained. Smog has also gotten into our tap water now and we are unable to drink it, yet for some reason some people wanna defend ScoMo and his fossil fuel love affair.",environment,1578441523,MyMindIsForeverOff,4,1,True,2020-01-07 18:58:43

And, just like newspapers, books, magazines or even mobile phones, the Internet is a source of Propaganda. What is Propaganda? I think the best defintion is: Propaganda is the act of spreading lies or information, which are only half true, with the goal of achieving an Agenda. Joseph Goebells didn't tell the people they were aryans, because he wanted to share his knowledge, but because he wanted to gain power. People go to the Internet, because their President writes on Twitter. Nothing special. But the problem of the Internet is that not only people can access data, but share data as well. In the past president Roosevelt said *Apples are green*. You either believed him or not. Maybe you looked at another source and suddenly found this statement: *Apples are red*. You consider that Roosevelt has already lied once and so believe that Apples are red. In reality this is far more complex and most people either didn't read a second source at all or many more than just a second one.  
But in the age of the Internet people don't have just a few different sources, but hundred-thousands. If an article has 256 comments, youll have 256 different opinions. Who do you believe, if the author claims x, but the comments say y?   
It all boils down to simple human concepts: the mass is always right. If you have 5 friends and 1 says the moon is a sphere and the others say it's made out of cheese, then it's made out of cheese. Because the mass is always right. We see this behaviour in the political parties, we see this behaviour in environmentalism with the argument of ""97% scientists say"" and we see this behaviour in our daily life. But it's wrong. The human mind is oversaturated with opinions and starts using his instincts and believes what the masses say - and the masses are controlled by bots and paid actors. 

Even worse: Influencer are bad for the society. So why where people in the past Heroes? Why did people liked Michael Jordan or Will Smith? Aerosmith or ACDC? Because they were prominent and because of their actions. They had to be good actors or musicians, comedians or  politicans to be famous. And because they were famous, they made money. Nowadays however it's enough to generate clicks to make money. A company doesn't matter how you generate clicks, as long as they can reach the highest amount of audience and make profit. You could kill Koalas in front of a camera and if your videos make billions of views, people will praise you for your fame and will give you money. Someone like PewDiePie isn't a good role model. He doesn't tell people to get educated, but shows them that using insults is fine, if you are rich. 

Most (not all of course) Influencers are stupid, uneducated and have no morale. They are rich, because they are famous, they are famous, because they have viewers and they have viewers because they are rich. This hurts society and should not be underestimated. I'd like to link the mass depression of these times to this: people see that bad people make a lot of money by holding a product in the camera. They criticize this and get insulted by their blind fanbase and they get depressed. Then they spread their opinion on social media themselves and drag down other people too. In the end no one cares for Australia, Iran or Amazonas anymore, because everyone is on suicide watch. As long as someone can make money by being stupid, saying insults or making low-effort videos, this Society is screwed. We as society praise people who hurt this society, instead of praising those who try to save the planet. 

This sub has only 641k members. That's incredible low. Posts here usually have around 140-300 comments, while the latest articles about the Iran go up to several thousands comments (around 3,2k). Why is that so? Because the Internet feeds us with articles - TV and Social Media news only know one topic now: war. They want you to talk about war, so you click their articles. If they would make diverse articles about all problems in this world (plastic in the ocens, nuclear waste, Koalas dying) their clicks would be lower than if they simply make the same amount of articles about a possible war. 

Media and Internet is responsible for this. Without a doubt. Large companies (oil, gas, coal) advocate against Climate Change actions. It's a proven fact that parties use bots and paid users to influence social media in election times - So why shouldn't people with even more moeny don't do that? Even more: In many countries the amount of donations for parties has declined - This shows, that companies are no longer interested in influencing politics to make profit, but they simply donate money to influencers, bots, trolls or users to advocate in their sense. 

People are then confused: I say Climate Change real, others say not. Who is right? Because of Propaganda for Profits, 10,000 people write 10,000 different opinions and the 10,001 user doesn't know anymore what is correct. They start following their instincts and go back to tribalism: the mass is right. Our group is right and the others lie. Facts, I am talking about Scientifical Researches, become a lie and alternative facts are repeated so often, that people start believing them (this concept comes from Joseph Goebells). 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people, which are Climate Change deniers, wonder why people talk about Socialism. The answer is: Climate Change isn't a single problem. It's not a broken wheel that you can exchange and drive further. It's a systematical problem. It start where you can't buy a bread or a bottle of watter without hurting this planet, because the producer moved the production to India to lower costs, and it continues to the massive amount of manipulation that happens in the Internet.

Am I right or am I wrong?,"This is what capitalism does to the planet. The consumer is consumed by their incessant desire to consume. Capital makes people want things they don’t need. And due to the planet having such a large population, the production of everything is always on a massive scale. Emissions destroy the O-Zone layer. The O-Zone layer is a protective layer. The O-Zone layer is destroyed. The Sun is not having to go through this protective filter anymore. It’s causing the planet to heat up. That has caused ice caps to melt. That has raised sea levels. That has caused more frequent, and stronger, severe weather that has wrecked havoc all across the globe. Yes it still snows even though it’s called global warming. It is called global warming because the planet as a whole is heating up because the Sun’s heat is more intense because the O-Zone layer has been destroyed due to massive ammounts of emissions being released into the atmosphere which is where the O-Zone is located. “Weirder” winters, where it can either reach record highs or record lows; either way, it’s severely out of balance. Severe summers; more rain, leading to flooding, and/or drier summers leading to droughts and fires. And again, everything is on a massive scale. In Australia bats literally fall from the sky because of the heat, and koalas are stopping cyclists and drinking their water intuitively because animals f***ing understand what’s going on! They know they’re losing their homes! They know they’re losing their resources! Evolution take hundreds of thousands of years, and no species (including us, including PLANTS) is physically able to adapt in time. People are also losing their homes due to natural disasters; you may remember hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, etc.. We can’t forget the forest fires, the earthquakes, the tsunamis. Corporations are Not going to change because they are capitalism and capitalism is about consuming. The rich (and I mean Really rich) care about one thing, and that’s accumulating more wealth, and without any interest in taking responsibility for the hell they put the planet and everyone on it through. Capitalism is inherently Evil, period! Stop blaming evil for being evil! It ends when YOU choose to end it! You end it by LOVING YOURSELF! You are enough! You don’t need a new phone to take mirror pics and show everyone what you can BUY! Your self-love cannot be conditional on the Internet’s validation of your superficial self. YOU ARE ENOUGH! And if you’re afraid no one loves you, well guess what - I LOVE YOU! You are a human! And you are stronger than the evil your government has forced upon you! The change has to be made by you, shown through your ACTIONS! You can do it! Let’s make 2020 the start of a decade in which we TEAR DOWN WALLS AND BUILD BRIDGES!

It’s not her fault. She didn’t choose to have all these adults lie to her and instill her (and an entire generation, *again*) with *false* confidence. When you give a kid this much “power” and influence, they don’t know how to cope when being put in the workforce, which is where they finally realize they're brainwashed and unprepared for reality. They're out of their coddling environment and left lost and dissatisfied and it leads them to feel like *failures*. It’s so sad. They’re raising them the same way they raised millennials (but it’s even worse because of social media’s reach and power). I think it's all a ploy to expand the proletariat class. They have a really hard time keeping a job, and eventually they won't have their parents and they'll have to get whatever kind of job they can just to *survive*! Wanna end climate change?

Understanding The Plastic Cycle,"Plastic is a petrochemical. Petrochemical use is growing 7X faster than human population. By 2030 more oil will be used for petrochemicals than burned in cars every year. 

Oil is shipped to China, turned into plastic, shipped to you, discarded, shipped back to Asia where it is burned or dumped into the ocean. Plastic does not dissolve, it nano-granulates. Plastic is burned for electricity in Sweden. 

Plastic is eaten by fish, and gets eaten by you. You eat 4 credit cards worth of plastic per month. You drink  and breathe plastic. Nano-plastic is very attracted to nano-toxins. Nano-toxins enter your body through your skin, stomach and lungs, where they enter the bloodstream and start to eat the blood barrier to your brain. Many nanoparticles come from engine combustion, and tire and brake wear. I believe tire particles are a major cause of asthma.

Magnetite nano-particles from engine combustion go up your nose and straight inside your brain. The epigenetic effects of nanotoxicity will affect our kids, and their kid's kids with cumulative irreversible unstoppable consequences.

I wrote a small book where I propose a solution to environmental crisis. What do you think?,"Happy New Year Everyone!

I hope you guys are all safe and having a good time. I know you all made your resolutions, and ready to change things for the better this year.

I did too. My new year's resolution is to add my contribution to fixing the planet.

Last year, I saw Aurora's talk on ""Outrage &amp; Optimism"" ([https://youtu.be/5yMwiif8iLw](https://youtu.be/5yMwiif8iLw?fbclid=IwAR15kDTXp--_jx8Cyv1XFzBMNAOLELnvcE5Oh6G3Mio8GSVXu_ySo_IwERk)). She said that she wants to be a part of the generation that will be remembered as the generation that fixed the dying planet, and not the one that killed it. This was quite inspirational and got me thinking... and since I am a problem solver as a software engineer, I asked myself a question of how I would approach solving a larger and non-trivial problem like this.

Of course, before thinking of a solution, you have to understand what is causing the problem, and after some time of carefully thinking about the issue, I found the culprit, something that can actually be fixed and is the root cause. The culprit is the mass culture of consumerism (not capitalism by itself as a lot of people believe). An addictive mass culture that both kills the planet and takes away our freedom at the same time.

I also understood that it is this culture that keeps us isolated, lonely and, because of this, hooked.

I was also fascinated and inspired by Greta's movement for climate action, but the solution that came to my mind wasn't related to politics and believing that it is the responsibility of politicians to solve this.

I realized that the solution will be to unplug from the culture of consumerism. But how? By becoming self-sufficient.

I knew that off-the-grid living is something that the world already knows about and isn't something viral and doesn't seem to become a way of life of the many. A lot of people think that you have to go off every grid to unplug. But it is not true.

I propose a model of life that I call ""Unit of Self-Sufficiency"" that I believe is a much more flexible approach. It will be a bit lengthy to describe it here, so I wrote a mini-book explaining my vision. You can find it here: [https://aeroaquaponic.org](https://aeroaquaponic.org/?fbclid=IwAR2zzfCvPWUvtAZiub-4jfx2RT-IPcQYEh4o4GoXa5pdpTVzP-rfoUeb0x4)

I don't know whether this is THE solution, but this is certainly something that I am going to dedicate myself to from now on. I am also dedicating myself to sharing all of the knowledge that I will get along the way with all of you, and I hope you will find it useful.

Happy new year!",environment,1577923731,aeroaquaponic,5,1,True,2020-01-01 19:08:51
India's waste crisis,"I am two days into my trip to India, coming from the US. So far, I have seen almost no trash cans either outside or inside buildings. Where does the trash go? The streets. The grass. Anywhere people can leave it (which is basically anywhere). Animals, including cows and dogs, roam the streets looking for food, and often consume that trash. Pollution in India is not something to be overlooked. The heaps of trash I see every second I'm outside, coupled with the heavy use of automobiles, has led to heavily polluted air - to the point that I can see and smell the smoke from fuel in the air. Land and water pollution are a given. 

India's waste management system relies on using poor communities and streets as dumps. A plastic bag ban has been implemented, and it's a start, but it's not stopping people from littering. I couldn't find one trash bin all day to throw out a wrapper I had. This needs to change.",environment,1577929053,strangelk,1,1,True,2020-01-01 20:37:33

Advice for alternatives to certain products in plastic,"


I'm managed to reduce my plastic use significantly. 

- shampoo bar
- Soap bar
- Aluminum thermos for drinks. 
- Reusable grocery bags.
- Reusable individual bags for fruits and veggies. 
- I take my own plastic containers for takeaways.
- I’m buying more fresh, unprocessed unpacked foods. Which are also healthier. 

But there are a few things I haven’t managed to stop using

-	Plastic bags to clean after my dogs, they’re one time used. 
-	Tooth paste. When I was a little girl toothpaste came in metal containers, I haven’t been able to find it for decades now. 
-	Sunscreen. Sunscreen came in aluminum jars when I was little, they’ve been substituted for plastic now.
-	Body lotion, I’ve looked for glass or metal containers but to no avail, if someone knows a brand that works with alternatives to plastic please let me know. 
-	Lip balm.",environment,1577943045,liebrelibre,6,1,True,2020-01-02 00:30:45

Being realistic,"Hey all-

I have some heavy thoughts that I wanted input on. Like all of us here, I read a lot about ecology, climate change, natural sciences, etc. The consensus seems to be ""we're almost at the point of no return- we need to act now!"" 

As an eco-communist, I philosophically agree. But the time for revolution and ecological regenerative practices needed to start decades ago. 

Realistically, the collective global society is going to continue with what it's doing. It seems like the time is long gone for us to repair or regenerate the eco-disaster we're in. I can't shake the feeling that all these calls for action are inauthentic. By all accounts, it looks like we are \*far\* past the ""point of no return."" And I'm not sure why we continue to act like salvation or reversal is possible. It's not. From biodiversity decimation, to monocropping, to antibiotic-resistant superbugs, to climate change, to ocean pollution, to carbon-dioxide-infested air, to the deforestation of the Amazon (and everywhere), to factory farming, to indigenous genocide, to the hundreds (thousands?) of tons of plastic produced and dumped per day, to nuclear contamination, to fascism, to capitalism, and so on...I don't see why the conversation is about us ""not being out of time"" and ""voting"" (which is an illusion of action) and ""community gardening"" or whatever.

The only ""solution"" is the destruction of capitalism, which doesn't seem to be disappearing any time soon. Realistically, we need everyone to quit their jobs and overthrow their governments in every country across the world. We need a global, interconnected peoples to focus on nature and abandon whatever menial 9-5 jobs that aren't related to politics/activism, natural sciences (or tech), or regenerative agriculture. Capitalist governments are run by the mega-corporations that are destroying the earth and killing all of us. They will not concede power willingly. We cannot vote our way out of a broken and exploitative system. 

We are out of time. Shouldn't we be talking about eco-revolution? Or how to survive in a post-collapse world? The conversation needs to stop being a lie about how we have time left to act. We do not. We need to act like we fucked up and it's game over. We need to embody the mentality that we ran out of time and now we're in survival mode. 

It's like writing a paper for school. When you have 4 months to write it, you don't stress. When the paper is due in 12 hours, you freak the fuck out and scramble to do the best job you can within the time constraint. That's where we are at. Our paper is due in 6 hours and we haven't even started.

&gt;People may incorrectly tell you that President Trump is doing nothing to help our environment, but the facts tell a different story.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump continues to advance realistic solutions to reduce emissions while promoting economy growth.

&gt;America’s environmental record is one of the strongest in the world and the U.S. has also been a world leader in reducing carbon emissions for over a decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have the cleanest air on record and remain a global leader for access to clean drinking water. President Trump has taken important steps to restore, preserve, and protect our land, air, and waters.

&gt;Meanwhile, China will remain the chief emitter of CO2 – emitting more than the US and the EU combined.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump has paved the way for more energy infrastructure development, ensuring American energy can be delivered.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump approved the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the New Burgos Pipeline.

&gt;America is now the world’s largest oil producer and in 2017 the United States became a net natural gas exporter for the first time in 60 years!

&gt;Crude oil exports nearly doubled in 2018, reaching a record average of 2 million barrels a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Coal exports reached their highest level in five years in 2018

Best Carbon Offsets?,"Hey, everyone. I have a question that I'd appreciate some input for. I'm not 100% sure that this subreddit is the best place to post, so if there's a better thread, please point me in that direction.

Quick context: I'm a student pilot. Aviation is my life's passion, and I can't see myself going into anything else. However, I can't shake the fact that aviation is among the worst things for the environment. Since the FAA requires me to keep a logbook of all of my flights , I decided that, in addition to making lifestyle choices to reduce my carbon footprint (going vegetarian, shorter showers, buying fewer clothes, etc), I'd use my logbook to eventually carbon offset all of my flying. The logbook requires me to log how much time I'm in the air, the aircraft I'm flying, and what I worked on, so I'll know if I did a bunch of touch-and-gos to work on takeoffs/landings.

I started researching potential carbon offsets, and I've heard that a lot of companies (is that what they are?) that do them act really unethically (e.g. they drive indigenous peoples off their lands to plant trees) or are ineffective (e.g. they go through on their carbon offset, but they produce their own emissions in the process without offsetting their own). 

Which companies do y'all know of are certified ethical and effective? Which are the best carbon offsets to get, and who should I get them from to guarantee the best effect?

Stanford Researchers Have an Exciting Plan to Tackle The Climate Emergency Worldwide (ScienceAlert 27 Dec 2019),"Using the latest data available, they have outlined how 143 countries around the world can switch to 100 percent clean energy by the year 2050.  This plan could not only contribute towards stabilising our dangerously increasing global temperatures, but also reduce the 7 million deaths caused by pollution every year and create millions more jobs than keeping our current systems.  The plan would require a hefty investment of around US$73 trillion. But the researchers' calculations show the jobs and savings it would earn would pay this back in as little as seven years.

""Based on previous calculations we have performed, we believe this will avoid 1.5 degree global warming,"" environmental engineer and lead author Mark Jacobson [told ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/stanford-researchers-have-a-plan-to-tackle-the-climate-emergency). ""The timeline is more aggressive than any IPCC scenario - we concluded in 2009 that a 100 percent transition by 2030 was technically and economically possible - but for social and political reasons, a 2050 date is more practical.""

The [report](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(19)30225-8) has been published in the journal *One Earth*; more details for individual countries can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWS-50-USState-plans.html).",environment,1577452553,Rosebud123456789,0,1,True,2019-12-27 08:15:53

Offsetting CO2 emissions by marine conservation is better than planting trees,"I will most likely be down voted for criticising team trees, I know if I dare make these comments on anything related to team trees I will not be heard. 

Now hear me out before you make a judgement, before I continue I'd like you all to know I have nothing against planting trees, in fact plant as much as you like or donate as much to planting as you like, giving to charity with good intentions is always honourable and I will never say it is wrong. 

The purpose of this is just to make people aware of what they may not know. 

The slogan behind team trees has been a considerable focus on co2 emissions being taken up by these 20 million trees. This is true of course. They also provide habitats for animals which is brilliant as we are continuously breaking them down, I dont want to take away the merits of this organization. The issue I want to raise is the significance of trees in co2 emissions, nothing else. And this issue is that your money can be better spent somewhere else if you want to reduce co2. 

The oceans are our primary resource of oxygen (50-85% of earths oxygen https://earthsky.org/earth/how-much-do-oceans-add-to-worlds-oxygen), which also makes them our primary source of co2 uptake. They take up about 1/3 of our co2. Trees do not even come close to this amount. There are sources below, but I'll explain it real easy here, at the peak of a trees life (10 years in) they take up the equivalent to 2 humans CO2, humans produce about 2.3 pounds a day of CO2. Oceans take up about 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. Issue with this is, there are 7 billion of us, youd need about 2 trees per person if you maintain them, and 7 trees in the wild if you do not, that is a ridiculous amount, which just is not possible.

Right now as this time farms, forests and plants take up roughly 28% of all co2 emission, which is already less than the 1/3 oceans do. However the issue is, we are polluting our oceans far more than we are our trees, we can replant trees, we can maintain that amount, but we cannot make up for the ocean with just trees. 

If you're still not convinced consider that trees when they die and rot release almost as much co2 in the atmosphere than they take up, oceans do not, the ocean creates co2 beds and stores them from being released. Yet right now trees have gotten far more consideration than the ocean has because of this. All I want is for people to pay attention to both, because our oceans are more at risk than our forests are.

Total Lifecycle Costing,"Pricing has been determined, for a large part directly or indirectly, by the cost of manufacturing. This is now broken. There are just too many of us buying and throwing away shit.

What makes sense is that the cost of a product should include the cost of disposing and/or recycling. If someone makes a car that costs more to make, but much less to dispose of or recycle, then she should be able to sell it for less while making the same profit margin. Good will or gov subsidy are not sustainable and subject to human corruption.

But if the cost is charged to the manufacturer, through some international agreement and enforcement, this would create strong incentives for R&amp;D and manufacturing, as well as consumption, to move toward a sustainable economy.

Obviously calculating the cost is not trivial, but is fundamentally a solvable problem. As long as a problem is solvable, it will be solved given enough incentive.

Who should be charged with calculating the cost?

Government, as usual, should be among the last choices. All the gov needs to do is to set up the legislation and enforcement machinery.

“It’s just one bag”,"I’m not the “save the environment” type of guy but, it’s a statistical fact that coral reefs are dying at an alarming rate due to garbage and ocean temperatures rising. It doesn’t take a science major to understand that chain reactions take place in these kinds of circumstances.


No coral reefs = No habitats for specific fish = The dying of those fish = Dietary restrictions for predators = Dying predators = Even less of a food source = Even more fish dying = An excess of Co2 in the water which means the plants will start dying due to algae blooms which means no sunlight reaches past the top layer of the ocean which means all life that lives in the ocean will inevitably die off due to either,

A) No available or maintainable food source

B) No available oxygen left to support so much life

Which means that our biggest oxygen producer, which is where we get I believe 50-85% of the oxygen we breathe every day, will be completely destroyed. And then one can only assume that only the rich will be able to afford tickets to Mars to continue to consume another planet. Which means YOU and all the other 7,000,000,000+ people are left to scavenge whats remaining of the earth until you inevitably die from,

A) Cannibalism

B) Lack of oxygen blood flow to the numerous vital parts of your body

C) Die off due to illness

D) All of the above

This is just ONE of the MANY ways just ONE person can affect the ocean all because they simply say “it’s just one wrapper or piece of plastic” and proceed to toss it out the window while they drive. Now imagine 5,000,000,000 people saying that exact same thing throughout the day/week/month/year. Thats a lot of garbage. I know this was long, and i know many will choose to skip over this because they dont care. But if every reddit user read this and thought twice about making a small change like not throwing that Mcdonalds bag out of the window because you don’t want to make that extra 5-10 second walk to throw it in the garbage at home, you would be quite surprised at the improvement you would see with ecosystems in the world around you. 

To leave you with something to make you think again, if we don’t change these things. Within the next 10-20 years, almost all of the reefs will bleach and die. Please think twice, and don’t think of this as a “save the planet” movement. Think of it as “save yourselves, and your children, and theirs” movement.

Some truth about and for environmentalists,"Funny how a lot environmentalist are full of intentions but really do nothing meaningful to change the situation. They go about wanting the governments to change laws and policies to take care of the climate, while they continue their consumer ways. For example, maybe not purchasing imported products, etc. that have a negative impact on the environment (through transport, cutting down of forests for growth, use of toxic materials for production, etc.) would be the real start to change. Funny thing is people protesting on the streets, then going home to eat fruits from another country (just an example) with a clean conscience. But I guess people don't want to make the little sacrifices needed (like growing vegetables if they have some space for a couple of pots). They want the actions to be taken for them and not by them. Eating indigenous foods and canning them would be a good start. But who likes to prepare and eat canned foods?... It's easier to tell the government: ''Hey I don't want those delicious mangoes from another country in my supermarket, we need laws and policies to prevent me from buying them because we all know I'm too dumb to do that by myself!"" It's all just like cold philanthropy where money fills deep pockets, little goes to research and the donor gets a tax cut.

The rings in the trunk the trees from that period and plenty other indicators show that there was a little ice age during the middle ages.

All that, at periods where humans did not pollute as much if at all. Yes, we are messing up the environment but to what extent and to what effect is another question.

I have listened to many opinions about climate change over the last few years and for some reason I’m drawn to Bjorn Lomborg’s work, for anyone thats not familiar he basically states climate change is real however the world has a lot of problems and although a lot of people want to throw ridiculous money at greener energy etc our resources might be better used elsewhere e.g preventable diseases.

"For our international friends, this is what is happening in Australia","Sydney (in the state of New South Wales) is the largest city on the continent. It’s population is around 5.2 million (about the same as Detroit), and its total area is 12,000 km squared, which is a little bit smaller than the US state Connecticut.

The ""megafires"" now dwarf and surround our city.

The air here is full of smoke dust, and is now the equivalent of smoking 38 cigarettes a day. As I'm writing, there is a gale blowing outside, the sky is thick brown, and I can't open the window because of the toxic dust. Also, I can't afford air conditioning, so I spend most spare moments in this Xmas period at the local shopping centre (mall). Most afternoons, there is an eerie yellow glow in the air, and all of those yellow / orange / brown tinted photos you’re seeing online with the apocalyptic red / orange sun are for real - I can stare directly at the sun most days. 

Further north, near another large city, Brisbane (in the state of Queensland), large fires also burn. And to our South East, not too far away, our capital city, Canberra is today completely shrouded in thick grey smoke. In fact, the major highway between Sydney and Canberra is currently closed. In the states of NSW and QLD combined, an area of 2.5 million hectares has been burned black, an area now larger than the country of Denmark.

Now keep in mind as you read this next bit that we are a modern developed nation…

Our Prime Minister Scott Morrison took a holiday to Hawaii as soon as the disaster struck...I know. What the fuck? He then headed to New York City for the opening of a megachurch, while back home over 500 homes were burning to the ground. No amount of happy-clapping and sing-songing prayers could save them. 

Morrison refused to release any emergency funds to the Rural Fire Services - a collection of state-by-state volunteer organisations that call on everyday people to temporarily abandon their jobs and their own threatened homes and families to go out and fight the fires in their local areas. So far 2 RFS volunteer firefighters have died amid shocking conditions, while local RFS divisions conduct desperate crowdfunding campaigns, begging for basic supplies such as face masks and bottled water. 

Not only did Morrison's federal government refuse to allocated an emergency fund, but the state government of NSW, run by Premier (Governor) Gladys Berejiklian this year slashed $12.9 million from the operational budget of Fire and Rescue NSW, and $26.7 million from the RFS - before the bushfire season had even commenced.   

I could go on about government action and inaction on climate change in this country, but sufficed to say that both major sides and almost all levels of politics and government are completely failing us, and failing the world. Our country's natural beauty is fast being eroded, while our contribution to climate change is overt and pig-headed.

And I sit here typing, while the leaves on the trees outside churn in a raging wind storm of disgusting smoke dust. Sometimes it's turbulent like this, but mostly it's still, unnerving.

Renewables have risen just  **0.09** percentage point in that same time frame! Let me remind you that coal plant CO2 emissions are very high, while gas is now produced mostly via fracking which [emits methane](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/15/20805136/climate-change-fracking-methane-emissions). Not to mention that even oil power plants have gone up, not down in that same period which is just insane.

Everyone is just talking about EVs, thinking they'll save the planet if they buy one, but in fact as thing stand they won't change a thing. Just fossil fuel getting burnt at a different place.

CO2 emissions - EV vs modern diesel car,"There have been several posts comparing EV efficiency by including the power source in the calculation, but they are often using confusing calculations (thermal efficiency ...) that don't always make sense. The most straight forward and available numbers I can think of are those of CO2 emissions per driven km. We can get direct data for any modern diesel car. We can also get very precise numbers for emissions of coal power plants, which can be combined with again exact numbers for EV range per kWh. We also need to adjust that with the efficiency of charging the battery, where significant loses do occur, but let's say we take a rather optimistic 15% as our number. We won't add losses on the grid to that because some minimal quantity of fuel itself is spent on refining and distribution of diesel fuel as well. So a relatively simple calculation, not much room for speculation.

Now on the subjects of this comparison. One one hand we have a new diesel car on the other an EV. Why we don't compare gasoline? Cause diesel is more efficient and also other emissions have been brought close to zero lately. Why we don't compare an average car, why take a new one. Because we are taking a standpoint of a buyer looking at the market at this point. If he is considering to buy an EV the only real alternative would be a new, modern, top of the line diesel car. She/he won't buy some hypothetical average car, they will buy this modern new one. And lastly, why use a coal power plant as the energy source in the equation?  Because they are the least efficient source still around and they are the variable in the equation. More efficient sources are used to their current full potential, unlike coal which is used to fill the gap.  As we proceed to switch to EVs in larger numbers we will be increasing electric energy demands considerably. This will inevitably increase or at least prolong the usage of coals. If we want to move away from coal, we need to save electricity, not consume more. 

So, the calculation! A 2019 VW Passat emits between 109  and 151 g of CO2 per driven km, depending on the model. Let's take a front wheel drive 2.0 TDI which emits 117 g/km as our choice. On the other hand we take a Tesla Model 3 which uses 16 kWh per 100 km driven, regardless of the variant more or less.  When we multiply that by the amount of CO2 that a coal power plant emits, which would be around 0.9 kg per kWh produced and 1.06 per kWh charged in the cars battery (+15%). If we multiply this by 16 kWh a Model 3 needs to drive 100 km and adjust it to g/km we get 169 g of CO2 per km. This is a whole 44% more that the diesel Passat - it's not even close.

And the moral of this story? Look at the big picture. If you want to help the planet, don't think buying an EV is automatically the best thing you can do. Consider the energy source! If your country or region is still using coal, try to save electricity, don't double your usage by buying an EV cause you will only make things worse.  Once the last coal plant shuts down, calculate again based on natural gas and make your decision then.",environment,1576413519,benzonite,15,1,True,2019-12-15 07:38:39

When I became older and visited Indonesia when I was 21 I was very concerned about all this beautiful rain Forrest getting destroyed because of the human need for all kinds of products. Since I'm really concerned with global warming and think about solutions very often, I find that the deforestation is once of the biggest catalyzers since the burning puts C02 in the air while the trees are actually the natural cleaners of C02. This makes this problem twice as big. Because this concerns me so much and I want other people to be more aware of this too I decided to devote the video to raise awareness.  In my opinion, we should look at the root of the cause which is mainly the demand for palm oil. The big demand for palm oil should be reduced. Although I also wonder if a substitution will be harm-free, maybe you guys can tell me solutions on this. 

Since I think music can deliver a powerful message I asked a talented film producer from Indonesia to make a video showing the impact of deforestation. The budget was only 150 dollar and still, he did an amazing job showing what the big demand for palm oil does to his country. 

I want to donate all revenue which the track generates with it streams to an NGO that focusses on the prevention of deforestation and demand for palm oil.

An idea,So I thought about how can we can reduce plastic in the environment and came up with this. Imagine if McDonald's (just an example) would start charging $1 more for every menu but... would give you back $1 for returning your Coca Cola plastic cup. So a $5.99 menu would become $6.99 but in the end if you returned the cup you would be still be paying the old $5.99. Since nobody would rather throw cups in the trash bin than get 1$ for basically no effort I can see this working,environment,1576539776,IRowmorethanIBench,10,1,True,2019-12-16 18:42:56
Act like a Boomer for climate action—send a letter/fax to your gov representative!,"Horrified by the Madrid Failure, I asked a friend in gov policy what one can do to move the needle on climate action. I’ll bet lots of people feel like they’re doing everything right in their personal lives—cycling, recycling, etc—but still feel so powerless to fight climate change. 

Here’s what my friend had to say:

“Yes, Madrid failed. Yes, unprecedented coordinated international action is needed to meet the IPCC targets. Yes, that is unlikely to come in time to prevent global geography from changing dramatically in our lifetime as a result of climate change. And yes, humans are terrible at future-planning.

In terms of policy/politics advice, social media doesn't matter unless you have the reach of Cambridge Analytica or a Russian troll. Mass petitions usually just get a form response written by an intern. An exception is petitions submitted formally to Parliament, In Canada, if you get 25 signatures on paper (or 500 online) any MP can submit the petition and the government has to respond. In the UK the threshold for a government response is 10,000 signatures on an e-petition, but if you get 100,000 it will (almost certainly) be debated in Parliament. I don't know about the US.

*Letters matter. MPs actually decide to do things based on letters. Everyone sends emails so they're noticed less. If someone sends a letter, they're old and/or they really care. (Old people get political attention. In some respects, young people could benefit from taking a page out of old peoples' book. Their paper book.) Also, politicians have fax machines that nobody uses, so when a fax comes through everyone notices.*

All of the things you do make a difference. But they make more of a difference if you help people with power to make their own choices on similar grounds. And the more directly you can reach them the better.",environment,1576548997,OhHelloLeahE,1,1,True,2019-12-16 21:16:37

Measures we can take to eliminate the problem of plastic from our planet.,"So today i was taking a walk in a open green area i saw lots of plastic bags and other plastic waste on the soil and even they were also stuck inside the soil which is obviously causing environment degradation. When i got home i started thinking that how can we eradicate the problem of plastic from our surroundings. So i started my research to end this problem. I saw many articles but then i saw complete information to solve this issue.

I found this article and video very useful and interesting to eliminate plastic completely from our planet. Everyone should must have a look on this and follow these measures to solve this problem.

"Climate change is unimportant, is it? I live in NSW Australia. I feel every day like I'm living in an apocalypse film."," I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.

Today has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

Today was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.

Sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.

We are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

The sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

It's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""I wish you all the luck in the world"" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is ""We will stand and defend our home.""

These aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.

You'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

These thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

Because these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

I've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

And then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

Outside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

I look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.

Never before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""Climate change?"" they say. ""What climate change?""

I looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, ""Thank the fates we have it okay here!""

Now I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.",environment,1575960918,GertieGuss,1,1,True,2019-12-10 01:55:18
"Should America have a new animal protection category, ""Permanently Protected Species,"" separate from endangered species status?","The nene goose, the Hawaiʻi state bird, [has officially been downlisted](https://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2019/12/08/video-nene-downlisted-from-endangered-to-threatened/) from endangered to threatened under the ESA.  Another story on the same topic wrote:

&gt;Even with the news of the population recovery, nene still have a long way to go before their population is fully recovered.

Full recovery means the species *could* be hunted, as far as federal law is concerned.  That would not be accepted in Hawaii, which essentially made the same statement in 2012 when [a proposal to delist the green sea turtle](https://www.environment-hawaii.org/?p=544) arose.  From the article:

&gt;more than 100,000 people had signed petitions...(opposing) the delisting...the National Marine Fisheries Service, whose proposed delisting of the turtle prompted the outpouring of support, is not supposed to be guided by public opinion. Rather, the determination it makes is to be based on the best science available.

Well it looks like public opinion is demanding a *new approach* to these matters: special consideration for *special animals.*

What exactly are *special animals* and why do they have this appeal?  I won't try to answer that, but here's a short list:  green sea turtles, nene, whales, other marine mammals, America's feral horses, grizzly bears, great apes, chimpanzees.  Each animal has a large constituency that wants these animals protected from all hunting/killing, regardless of endangered species ranking, forever.

Q: Would a *Permanently Protected Species* category be of value?  

Increasingly we're seeing heated debates over delisting--the grizzly delisting debate was another one--where *Naysayers* with animal love or animal welfare orientations are using scientific challenges that take up inordinate time of the USFS and other federal agencies involved with administering the ESA.

Making Environmentally Friendly Events," With the rise in 'greener' events (Laing and Frost 2010) introducing sustainable policies and/or practices, such London Marathon, Glastonbury Festival, Burning man, who have different approaches to sustainability, opens a discussion to who should be held accountable to the increasing rise in solid waste, pollution and plastics within the industry.

Vapour pressure deficit is an important driver of glacial surface ice loss,"I took a glaciers and ice-sheets class during this semester of grad school, and I thought I'd share the schematic I made to explain some of what I found. I found that vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is a stronger driver of surface ice loss than incoming shortwave radiation, and that VPD was more important where it was low on average, likely due to it being the limiting factor. My method for this was to look at the relationships between latent heat flux, and shortwave downwelling radiation &amp; VPD at three locations that spanned a range of average temperatures and water availability.

New Vegan Protein,"New Vegan Protein Company - Change Protein [www.changeprotein.co.uk](https://www.changeprotein.co.uk)

Change protein was founded on the belief that we can make our customers healthier while allowing them to save the world. Simple, right?  


By using plant proteins in our products we can create a product that is still crammed full of protein and nutrients but uses a fraction of greenhouse gasses to create when compared to whey. Oh and the taste is impressive too!  


Plant proteins are also incredible for your body. They are proven to increase blood flow to your muscles by reducing inflammation and blood viscosity meaning that your muscles get the nutrients they crave, faster. Plant proteins are also shown to both increase energy levels and increase muscle efficiency by up to 18%. This means that you’ll have the grit to power through/conquer your workout and outperform your peers.  


I have almost always felt helpless in the face of climate change. It was always too big an issue to deal with and I thought that someone else would take care of it.  


However, after several decades of feeling helpless, I decided to do something about it and that’s when Change Protein was born.  


“The world is changing and I want to be part of that. I want everyone to be part of that”  


I have a vision to change the way that we consume protein so that in the future we have a minimal impact on the environment. There’s something very satisfying about that, right?. The world is changing and I want to be part of that. I want everyone to be part of that and you can too by making small changes in your life.  


Making changes doesn’t need to be complex, it can be as simple as changing how much animal products you consume to reduce Co2 emissions or as simple as walking somewhere rather than driving.  


That is the ethos of change protein: to make changes simple and improve the world we live in.  


Be part of this brave new movement and together, we can [change protein](https://www.changeprotein.co.uk)",environment,1576019153,andrew-changeprotein,0,1,True,2019-12-10 18:05:53

I'd love to hear everyone's recommendations or any critique that they would provide for my email, in hopes of at least providing a source to others to combat misinformation.

Here's the original email that was forwarded to me:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The real question is why is she in Canada with 1.6% of global emissions greenhouse gasses and not in the US with more than 15% of global emissions of greenhouse gasses?  Maybe this should give you a clue.

&gt;  
&gt;1. She is backed by a number of Swedish/Swiss venture/vulture capital funds focused to investing in green technologies which are struggling to find companies to invest in.  Most of these companies require initial government funding.  The funds are owned by executives from  a Swiss/Swedish industrial corporation with annual revenues of 27 billion dollars. You see their offices around Calgary as they are suppliers to the oilfield service industry as well as many others. Clearly this is a ploy to get government grants/ funding for these entities so that the venture capital funds can then invest and make a bunch of money.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. She was chosen from a number of young Swedish girls to represent their interests, trained and given information to start espousing because of course she has no scientific expertise herself.  They wanted a female child as their symbol. She was the perfect spokesperson.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3. A powerhouse marketing firm out of Germany was hired to design and implement a marketing strategy for her to gain worldwide attention. They did and it worked. She gained worldwide attention and addressed the UN. The 500 scientists, from around the world, who sent a letter to the UN did not gain an audience.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4. She slammed my generation and generations previously. We stole her childhood.  A script written for her by the German marketing firm.  Her childhood is like it is because of the sacrifice of a previous generation, many of whom  lie buried in fields in Europe.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;5. She then gets used again by Canadian political leaders for photo op’s.  Shame on our political leaders. The fact that she got face to face time with Trudeau should be abhorrent to Canadians.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;6. She leads a school protest march in Canada, where again photo op greedy politicians, take part.  Her ability to protest rests solely with the sacrifice of other generations, including Edith Cavell, whom she chastises.  If you don’t know who Edith Cavell is - then shame on what a lark our Canadian school system has become.

&gt;This is what I found out.  If anyone finds facts disputing this I am all ears.""

Hi guys,

  
You're probably not going to read this or reply anyway, *but here we go*... supported by sources and all, feel free to read them as well and critique my feedback.  


&gt;The real question is why is she in Canada with 1.6% of global emissions greenhouse gasses and not in the US with more than 15% of global emissions of greenhouse gasses?  Maybe this should give you a clue.

First off, it's clear this person doesn't even bother fact checking their statements and is spreading misinformation... she was at the Climate Action Summit in New York in September.  
[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-24/greta-thunberg-speech-climate-change-un-summit-how-dare-you/11541300](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-24/greta-thunberg-speech-climate-change-un-summit-how-dare-you/11541300)

It's a bit of a shame to see that this is true, but that was the choice of the skipper, they could have very well sailed the boat back. Additionally, they offsetted the carbon footprint of the flights.

Where is the source on this? Who are these companies? I cannot find anything on the matter, closest thing is speculation on her ties to Ingmar Rentzhog (mentioned below).  


&gt;2. She was chosen from a number of young Swedish girls to represent their interests, trained and given information to start espousing because of course she has no scientific expertise herself.  They wanted a female child as their symbol. She was the perfect spokesperson.

Source on this? The closest thing I can find is speculation from that she's in cahoots with Ingmar Rentzhog because he used her name in a prospectus. In response, she  ""stepped down from the company’s Youth Advisory Board in the wake of the revelations"" and she states ""Many people love to spread rumours saying that I have people 'behind me' or that I'm being 'paid' or 'used' to do what I’m doing. But there is no one 'behind' me except for myself,"".

Cannot find any sources on this. The closest thing, once again, is Ingmar Rentzhog, who runs a social media start-up for climate change... and he's based out of Sweden. He has stated to Vice that:""They think that I am the PR genius behind Greta,"" he told me. ""That I write her speeches and arrange meetings for her with journalists. That's simply not true.""

&gt;4. She slammed my generation and generations previously. We stole her childhood.  A script written for her by the German marketing firm.  Her childhood is like it is because of the sacrifice of a previous generation, many of whom  lie buried in fields in Europe. 

Once again, who is this German marketing firm? Sources people! Additionally, they mention that they were saved by their previous generation, so why isn't their generation pulling up their boot straps now? What happens to my generation when we have a shortage of food and water?

Irrelevant and opinionated rhetoric.

Irrelevant and opinionated rhetoric. Gatekeeping and insulting people's lack of knowledge. As an example, I'm not here to judge someone for not knowing who Alan Turing is and why his work was so important in the war or Computer Science.  


&gt;This is what I found out.  If anyone finds facts disputing this I am all ears.""

Is this a feasible solution for climate change? Any climate change experts able to review if this is plausible?,"Interested to hear if this is a plausible solution.  What do experts think? 

Climate change at a most basic level is caused by huge deposits of carbon that has been rapidly released from deep underground into the atmosphere - i.e. burning oil and coal.  This adds carbon to the atmosphere (and the entire carbon cycle).

So to solve climate change we need to bury large quantities of carbon back underground to remove the carbon from the carbon cycle.  To do this we need to find a large organic mass and take this out of the carbon cycle.  I.e. you could grow trees and then bury them deep underground (making sure that they didn't decompose to release their carbon as methane).

But there is a more readily available, and high volume carbon rich source that is a current waste product - sewage.  You could dry the sewage (to reduce decomposition and likelihood of groundwater contamination) and bury this deep underground to seal this up.

This is not to say we shouldn't get to a zero carbon economy and plant more trees too, but even once we have done this we will need to sequester carbon in the ground somehow.",environment,1576218514,notgreenenough,5,1,True,2019-12-13 01:28:34

"""Latino Littering"" Isn't Actually a Metaphor for Anything Other Than Latino Littering","One of the weirder and more revealing obsessions of the conventional wisdom is the widespread assumption that anybody who *mentions* America’s obvious problem of [Latino Littering](https://vdare.com/search?q=Latino+Littering), such as [Tucker Carlson](http://www.unz.com/isteve/littering-latinos/), [Amy Wax](http://www.unz.com/isteve/amy-wax-crimethinker/), Ann Coulter, or [myself](https://vdare.com/posts/why-does-mentioning-latino-littering-trigger-liberals-into-rage), must actually have in mind something unspeakably more evil than littering: we must be accusing Latin American immigrants of Ritual Pollution or Corruption of Blood or the Taint of Amalek or something. “Littering” must be a metaphor for something deep and dark.

But, no, actually, when I point out that Latinos tend to litter a lot, what I really mean, deep down, is that Latinos tend to litter a lot.

In fact, as I’ve said many times over the years, littering is about the most socially constructed problem imaginable and we know we could socially deconstruct, because white people deconstructed their own tendency to litter a lot about a half century ago. In fact, the most famous anti-littering public service announcement, 1971’s “[Crying Indian](https://youtu.be/8Suu84khNGY)” TV commercial [specifically engaged in racial shaming of whites](https://vdare.com/posts/1971-crying-indian-anti-littering-psa-and-racial-shaming) as pointing out that we were uglying up with our littering this beautiful country we took over from the American Indians.

We could probably do something similar with shaming Latinos into not uglying up this beautiful country so much, except that the whole concept that Latinos litter too much is considered, by the conventional wisdom, to be some kind of genocidal dog whistle.

Why this insanity?

I think because progressives tend to have a lot of deep dark racist thoughts that feel like they can only suppress with an immense effort, like Dr. Strangelove’s urge to shout Heil Hitler, by projecting all their racist disgust on to extremely sane and positive-minded people like me who see problems and think about ways to ameliorate them.

I called the suicide prevention hotline.,"By request of many people in the past few months, such as:

- You need serious help, here the number to the suicide hotline

I decided to take up the offer and seek help! And was it interesting!

I called and spoke with the operator, who asked me what was going on. I explained to her in short:

‘I was browsing the sub reddit, and I made a comment on a Greta post and people said I needed to call you guys and that y’all could help me’

She responded ‘hold one moment and I’ll get you to the correct department one moment’

I waited about ten minutes since they were high call volumes. It routed me to my home state emergency crisis line.

The kind lady (named Susan) asked me what the problem was.

I explained (in better detail this time) that I was browsing the sub and saw a meme. The meme was a clown with balloons(no, this is not made up) and the next slide shows Greta sati ‘are those plastic?’ In which case the clown goes and hides. Signifying Greta’s power as a environmentalist. I explained how I commented and said ‘Greta is wearing a plastic raincoat in the slide’. I was met with a response telling me to call the suicide hotline and to get help!

Susan, then asked me if I have had thoughts of suicide in the past. I said no. She asked if I feel the urge to harm other people or myself. I said no.

She then mentioned ‘isn’t Greta a little girl?’ 

I said ‘yes, but my comment wasn’t mean towards her’
 
I then explained a simple relation;

‘If I tell someone using gasoline is bad, but then use gasoline myself, and that person notices and says ‘hey, you’re burning gasoline, too!’ 

‘Is that bullying?’

‘No, that is not bullying’

‘Is it bullying to tell people they are candidates for suicide and need to get help immediately?’

‘Yes, there is something seriously wrong with telling people that in a situation that you described. It is never ok to tell someone they need to commit suicide, either’

She then had some basic questions about myself. She asked me if I want her to set up an appointment for me.

I said, ‘if you feel that I need further assistance, I will gladly take your advice. But it as a professional, if you think I’ll be okay I won’t go any further’",environment,1575567307,r3c0nn3ct,3,1,True,2019-12-05 12:35:07

A monetary alternative that can help us harmonize our relationship to nature,"Hi everyone,

I choose to talk here to because I am really concerned by the way we humans are dealing with nature in general.

It has been years that I study how we can make the things better, with less harm and more harmony.

To me, one of the most important point, and one the most evaded, is how we manage our markets through currencies.

The huge majority of the money created today comes from debt and creates and maintains an artifical unbalanced situation that leads to hyper growth not indexed on real human needs but on financial debtical needs.

There is an alternative that started two years and a half ago in France, an experiment that could completely change the way we manage our exchanges and markets.

I made a post on it: [https://www.reddit.com/user/boudleo/comments/e759w0/money\_debt\_overproduction\_a\_new\_currency\_to\_try/](https://www.reddit.com/user/boudleo/comments/e759w0/money_debt_overproduction_a_new_currency_to_try/)

It is quite long but I'd really be glad if some people around here could take the time to reach for the information.

I honestly think that if people around the globe appropriate this new type of currency, it could teally change something.

This is a sort a democratic currency, debt-free, co-created by members.

Improving Campus Recycling," 

American Universities generate large amounts of waste annually and much of the material recycled ends up ruined due to improper materials being recycled alongside them. My colleagues and I at the College of Charleston believe that much of this is due to improper signage at waste receptacle locations and we are offering a free sample of signs to test out at your local universities. Experimenting with the variety of signages linked below will hopefully result in a lower amount fo improperly disposed of waste on the campus. Any results you may find would be greatly welcomed.

Leonardo DiCaprio responds to Brazil President Bolsanaro about the Amazon Fires,"* On Friday, November 29, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro accused Hollywood actor Leondardo DiCaprio of financing fires set in the Amazon rainforest earlier this year. Bolsonaro claimed DiCaprio gave “money to set the Amazon on fire.”
* According to the New York Times, President Bolsonaro’s remarks are his latest attempt to shift blame for the Amazon fires onto environmental groups operating in Brazil.

Repository of Useful Information,"Back on Earth Day 2017 I created an 18-page repository of publicly available research on climate change and global environmental degradation, quoting some of the most pertinent sections of various reports/studies I read over the prior year and sorting by relevant area along the way - hyperlinked for easy referencing. Have always been looking for a way to share this information and make sure it gets put to good use (I would encourage everyone to please read all of the source material as well), so here it is. ⧗

**Odds, Consensus, and Irreversibility**

[https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831)

“We estimate odds ([Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831#t1)) of no more than 1-in-1,000,000 that the 2014 temperature record would have arisen from natural \[variability\] alone for both NH and the globe. That conclusion also holds for the other record years 1998, 2005, and 2010. Allowing for all of the potential variants in dataset and methodology ([Supplementary Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831#s1)), that conclusion remains true for 2014, but the odds are somewhat higher for 1998 in particular (as high as 1-in-50,000 for NH and 1-17,000 for globe).”

[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002)

“The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook *et al* (*Environ. Res. Lett*. [**8** **024024**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024)) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (*N* = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 *Environ. Res. Lett.*[**11** **048001**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001)) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.”

“This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the ‘dust bowl’ era and inexorable sea level rise.”

“Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60% for genetics to 100% for species distribution.”

“Many scientists argue that we are entering the sixth great mass extinction and that anthropogenic climate change is one of the major threats to global biodiversity ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r1)–[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r3)). Comprehensive, multitaxon reviews suggest that 10–70% of plant and animal species assessed so far could be at increased risk of extinction from climate change ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r4)) or that by 2050, climate-induced changes in habitat will commit 15–37% of species to extinction ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r1))… Many species are also expected to be adversely affected by changes in sea-level and ocean chemistry ([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r9)), and the impacts of climate change may include breakdowns in biological interactions as species respond individualistically to climate change ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r10)), loss of habitat because of sea-level rise ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r11)), and higher mortality because of increased ocean acidity ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145734/#r12)).”

“…we estimated that 47% of terrestrial non-volant threatened mammals (out of 873 species) and 23.4% of threatened birds (out of 1,272 species) may have already been negatively impacted by climate change in at least part of their distribution. Our results suggest that populations of large numbers of threatened species are likely to be already affected by climate change, and that conservation managers, planners and policy makers must take this into account in efforts to safeguard the future of biodiversity.”

[http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001104](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001104)

“The results show that climate-related local extinctions have already occurred in hundreds of species, including 47% of the 976 species surveyed. This frequency of local extinctions was broadly similar across climatic zones, clades, and habitats but was significantly higher in tropical species than in temperate species (55% versus 39%), in animals than in plants (50% versus 39%), and in freshwater habitats relative to terrestrial and marine habitats (74% versus 46% versus 51%). Overall, these results suggest that local extinctions related to climate change are already widespread, even though levels of climate change so far are modest relative to those predicted in the next 100 years. These extinctions will presumably become much more prevalent as global warming increases further by roughly 2-fold to 5-fold over the coming decades.”

[http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.2001104](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.2001104)

“Here, I use these data to show that recent local extinctions related to climate change have already occurred in hundreds of species around the world. Specifically, among 976 species surveyed, local extinctions occurred in 47%. These extinctions are common across climatic zones, habitats, and groups of organisms but are especially common in tropical regions (which contain most of Earth’s species), in animals (relative to plants), and in freshwater habitats. In summary, this study reveals local extinctions in hundreds of species related to the limited global warming that has already occurred. These extinctions will almost certainly increase as global climate continues to warm in the coming decades.”

“Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.”

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781852/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781852/)

“Climate change is causing mismatches in food supplies, snow cover and other factors that could severely impact successful migration and reproduction of avian populations unless they are able to adjust to new conditions. Resident (non-migratory) birds also face challenges if precipitation and/or temperature patterns vary in ways that result in mismatches of food and breeding. Predictions that many existing climates will disappear and novel climates will appear in the future suggest that communities will be dramatically restructured by extinctions and changes in range distributions.”

“According to information reported by employers to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 0.2% of ‘mass’ layoffs – layoffs of 50 or more workers – are caused by government intervention or regulations (of any kind, not just environmental regulations). / For every job lost due to regulations, 15 are lost due to “cost cutting” and 30 are lost due to “organizational changes” (e.g., change in ownership).”

“Finally, when looking at the total effect of environmental regulations on the economy, the effect is overwhelmingly positive. According to the Office of Management and Budget, cost benefit calculations for all major regulations between 2005 and 2014 showed economic benefits that dramatically exceeded costs, every single year. / The benefits of environmental regulations have exceeded costs by a ratio of more than 10:1 / All told, major regulations provide net economic benefits to the U.S. of over $500 billion per year… / In the case of fuel efficiency standards, net job creation was estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, with five jobs created for every job lost… / For every dollar invested, wind and solar projects create twice as many jobs as fossil fuel projects. / Wind and solar generate almost five many times more jobs, per Gigawatt-hour of electricity generation, than fossil fuels.”

“A 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that stronger environmental policies lead to short-term gains in productivity growth, resulting in permanently higher levels of productivity.”

[https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/fcost.pdf](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/fcost.pdf)

“New research shows that if present trends continue, the total cost of global warming will be as high as 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Four global warming impacts alone—hurricane damage, real estate losses, energy costs, and water costs—will come with a price tag of 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP, or almost $1.9 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) by 2100.”

[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/cost\_of\_delaying\_action.pdf](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/cost_of_delaying_action.pdf)

“Based on a leading aggregate damage estimate in the climate economics literature, a delay that results in warming of 3° Celsius above preindustrial levels, instead of 2°, could increase economic damages by approximately 0.9 percent of global output. To put this percentage in perspective, 0.9 percent of estimated 2014 U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately $150 billion. The incremental cost of an additional degree of warming beyond 3° Celsius would be even greater. Moreover, these costs are not onetime, but are rather incurred year after year because of the permanent damage caused by increased climate change resulting from the delay. / An analysis of research on the cost of delay for hitting a specified climate target (typically, a given concentration of greenhouse gases) suggests that net mitigation costs increase, on average, by approximately 40 percent for each decade of delay. These costs are higher for more aggressive climate goals: each year of delay means more CO2 emissions, so it becomes increasingly difficult, or even infeasible, to hit a climate target that is likely to yield only moderate temperature increases.”

“In the Energy Modeling Forum simulations in Clarke et al. (2009), the median additional cost (global present value) for a 20-year delay is estimated to be $0.7 trillion for 650 ppm CO2e but a substantially greater $4.7 trillion for 550 ppm CO2e. Many of the models in these studies suggest that delay causes a target of 450 ppm CO2e to be much more costly to achieve, or possibly even infeasible.”

“From initial glacier volumes and extents (Eq. 8), the mean projected changes in total ice volume at 2050 are −39.3 and −52.4 % for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively (Table 6). The minimum projected volume change at 2050 is −26 % (cold/wet), and the maximum is −70 % (warm/dry). At 2100 the projected mean total volume loss is estimated at −83.7 % for RCP4.5 scenarios, and −94.7 % for RCP8.5, with a range between −70 and −99 %. Radic et al. ´ (2014) and Marzeion et al. (2012), respectively, estimate mean glacier volume changes in south-east Asia of −50 and −60 % for RCP4.5 scenarios and −75 and −70 % for RCP8.5 by 2100. In all scenarios presented here, the rate of ice loss decreases towards the end of the simulation period (Fig. 16), which indicates a shift towards equilibrium mass balance conditions. / Increased precipitation may slow the rate of future mass loss, but it is not sufficient to offset the increases in glacier melt due to increased temperatures.”

“Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10–13% of the Amazon basin. Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.”

“Greenland Ice Sheet - Warming over the ice sheet accelerates ice loss from outlet glaciers and lowers ice altitude at the periphery, which further increases surface temperature and ablation. The exact tipping point for disintegration of the ice sheet is unknown, since current models cannot capture the observed dynamic deglaciation processes accurately. But in a worst case scenario local warming of more than three degrees Celsius could cause the ice sheet to disappear within 300 years. This would result in a rise of sea level of up to seven meters.

Arctic sea-ice - As sea-ice melts, it exposes a much darker ocean surface, which absorbs more radiation than white sea-ice so that the warming is amplified. This causes more rapid melting in summer and decreases ice formation in winter. Over the last 16 years ice cover during summer declined markedly. The critical threshold global mean warming may be between 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, but could already have been passed. One model shows a nonlinear transition to a potential new stable state with no arctic sea-ice during summer within a few decades…

West Antarctic Ice Sheet - Recent gravity measurements suggest that the ice sheet is losing mass. Since most of the ice sheet is grounded below sea level the intrusion of ocean water could destabilize it. The tipping point could be reached with a local warming of five to eight degrees Celsius in summer. A worst case scenario shows the ice sheet could collapse within 300 years, possibly raising sea level by as much as five meters.

Boreal forest - The northern forests exhibit a complex interplay between tree physiology, permafrost and fire. A global mean warming of three to five degrees Celsius could lead to large-scale dieback of the boreal forests within 50 years. Under climate change the trees would be exposed to increasing water stress and peak summer heat and would be more vulnerable to diseases. Temperate tree species will remain excluded due to frost damage in still very cold winters.

Amazon rainforest - Global warming and deforestation will probably reduce rainfall in the region by up to 30 percent. Lengthening of the dry season, and increases in summer temperatures would make it difficult for the forest to re-establish. Models project dieback of the Amazon rainforest to occur under three to four degrees Celsius global warming within fifty years. Even land-use change alone could potentially bring forest cover to a critical threshold.”

""Peak runoff in streams and rivers of the western United States is strongly influenced by melting of accumulated mountain snowpack. A significant decline in this resource has a direct connection to streamflow, with substantial economic and societal impacts. Observations and reanalyses indicate that between the 1980s and 2000s, there was a 10–20% loss in the annual maximum amount of water contained in the region’s snowpack. Here we show that this loss is consistent with results from a large ensemble of climate simulations forced with natural and anthropogenic changes, but is inconsistent with simulations forced by natural changes alone. A further loss of up to 60% is projected within the next 30 years.""

“Climate change has resulted in significant changes in weather pattern, precipitation distribution, temperature and moisture fluctuation, soil erosion, and desertification (FAO [2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR28)), although the average annual environmental measurements may not change significantly. Extreme conditions caused by these changes bring about many unexpected and more frequent biotic and abiotic stresses (Bebber et al. [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR7); Trenberth et al. [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR89)). To feed increasing world population, total crop production will need to be significantly increased with less arable land under much severe environmental conditions (Tilman et al. [2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR88)). For the past 50 years, such demanding has been met by continuous yield improvement. Unfortunately, yield growth has been slowing, rather than increasing as required by global population increase. For example, annual yield growth for three major cereals, rice, wheat and maize, has been decreased to 0.79–1.74 % for 1990–2010 from 2.19–2.95 % for 1960–1990. Moreover, if such reduction tendency continues, yield growth for 2010–2050 will decrease to 0.62–1.33 % (FAO [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR29); Pardey et al. [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR66)). For the next 50 years, we will have more people, but less water on the planet, and have to develop two times better crops for a world free of poor, poverty, and environment degradation.”

“Climate sensitivity of ecosystems—derived by fitting response functions to all locations in a given Koeppen climate group across 58 climate projections—varies strongly across climate zones (figure [3](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034036/meta;jsessionid=4A7D162B6CBA7BAD242A1C9A73B030A6.ip-10-40-1-105#erl398458fig3)): cold climate ecosystems show a high sensitivity to temperature changes but a low sensitivity to precipitation changes, whereas dryland ecosystems show opposite sensitivities. In temperate and tropical ecosystems the sensitivity to changes in precipitation depends on temperature change: strong warming increases the sensitivity to declining precipitation.”

“Efforts to understand the influence of historical global warming on individual extreme climate events have increased over the past decade. However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at &gt;80% of the available observational area.”

“Regardless of the ultimate cause for the observed relative stability in Δ*F*CO2,sol over the last 420 million years, business-as-usual emission scenarios (for example, representative concentration pathway RCP8.5)[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref39) for fossil fuel emissions suggest that atmospheric CO2 could peak in 2,250 AD at ∼2,000 p.p.m. CO2 values as high as this were last seen in the Triassic around 220–200 Myrs ago ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4)). However, because of the steady increase in solar output over time, in terms of radiative forcing by the end of this century RCP8.5 is similar to the early Eocene, and by 2,250 AD exceeds what is recorded in the geological record for at least 99.9% of the last 420 Myrs ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4)). A recent study suggested that if both conventional and non-conventional fossil fuel reserves (amounting to ∼12,000 Pg C; ref. [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref40)) were exhausted in such a business-as-usual scenario, atmospheric CO2 could rise to ∼5,000 p.p.m. by 2,400 AD (refs [41](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref41), [42](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref42)), which is clearly higher, in terms of both forcing and absolute CO2, than at any time captured by our compilation ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4), Wink12K scenario). Such a scenario therefore risks subjecting the Earth to a climate forcing that has no apparent geological precedent, for at least the last 420 Myrs.”

“Based on measurements of gases trapped in biogenic and abiogenic calcite, the release of methane (of ∼3–14% of total C stored) from permafrost and shelf sediment methane hydrate is deemed the ultimate source and cause for the dramatic life-changing global warming (GMAT &gt; 34 °C) and oceanic negative-carbon isotope excursion observed at the end Permian. Global warming triggered by the massive release of carbon dioxide may be catastrophic, but the release of methane from hydrate may be apocalyptic.

The Earth’s supply of fossil fuels was formed from remains of organisms that died hundreds of millions of years ago. In a sense, then, fossil fuels represent stores of the sun’s energy from the distant past. Because these resources are being used at a much higher rate than they are replenished, researchers are exploring methods of capitalizing on the photosynthetic process to provide alternative fuels

The power of sunlight can be tapped to generate a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Species of unicellular algae that are prolific producers of plant oils can be cultured in long, transparent tanks called photobioreactors, such as the one shown in the photo at Arizona State University.

Help me convince renewable sceptic,"I was talking to someone the other day and they claimed that solar/wind/hydro power can’t provide the current energy needs for europe, especially countries like germany which don’t get much sun and it would be impossible to build enough windmills to provide the energy they use. They claim renewables alone can only power very sunny ( australia, spain, texas), or coastal nations with a lot of tidal activity (norway). They claim in order to save the planet and reduce co2 we need to go back to a more primitive less energy demanding society. What do y’all think of this? Is this corret or are they wrong? If they are wrong can you provide links. 

This person also argues that:
1) there isn’t enouht lythium on the planet to replace every gas car with electric
2) mining lythium and manufacturing batteries for e-cars  is emitting a lot of co2 and pollution and requires fossil fuels to power, that is damaging to the envoirment 
3) renewables cant provide enough electricity to charge all f.ex european cars so the chargers will probably be powered by coal if everyone will switch to electric cars
4) europe is causing minimal contribution to the global emissions and europe becoming carbon neutral would make little to no difference to stop global warming with countries like china continuing to pollute

According to research published earlier this year by Gregory N. Bratman, et al; the environment can have a direct interaction with our mental health. It's effects can range from simply improving your mood to having a grounding effect that boosts your focus and attention. While the exact magnitude of what level of interaction equals to what level effect in a person is still undetermined, the study concluded that nature and an interaction with it as small as being near a tree in a city (cataloged as an ""urban green"" experience in the study) can fulfill a beneficial impact on the human psyche. A take away from the study is that ""\[Diverse shareholders\] including city planners, landscape architects, engineers, parks departments, developers, infrastructure providers, health professionals, community-based organizations, and environmental advocates, could use a tool that helps them anticipate the mental health impacts of decisions they make relating to the environment."" Meaning that cities can and should be designed with a connection to nature in mind to maintain our basic requirement for natural stimulation. However, this raises a question about our current climate crisis not often addressed by politics, which is, how will our collapsing ecosystem come to effect human mentality? When we no longer have access to forests, fields, or clean bodies of water, will the impact go beyond the death of our planet, to effect all of us at a deep psychological level?

I'm on a school working with the MYP system(maybe it is familiar to some). In the third year we have this thing called a community project where we have to do something for a community or a cause. We have chosen to do a fundraiser for the kilimanjaro area. They plant trees to help the nature and at the same time create jobs for the locals in poverty. The good thing is that they don't just plant trees but also take care of them till they will survive by them selves. The effects are already seen, ne nature is becoming more stable. The top three donators will receive a price made by the locals!

Our GoFundMe has already raised over €430 I will be adding a link at the end, any help is appreciated (one tree= €5)

We also made a website that will give more information on the project, the cause and our self, the website also contains a link to the GoFundMe

Worried sick about VOCs/known carcinogens like formaldehyde?,"Here's some context: I've had this room for years, and now suddenly I feel like every breath I take is a step closer to cancer because of the potential VOCs in my room. It's a relatively small room, and initially I was so pleased with it because I had a little theme going on. Full set of IKEA wooden furniture (bed frame, night stand, dresser, study desk) and even a full wall PVC wallpaper of New York City in the day. 

But recently I read some articles about formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) in ALL IKEA (and others) wooden furniture and especially PVC wallpaper. I'm still a kid, I can't possibly afford to just toss out my room and revamp the whole thing... 

Also, even if the IKEA wooden furniture claims to contain lower levels of formaldehyde...I have so many of them in one room...Does that mean they combine and accumulate and become hazardous? 

Man I'm worried sick and upset that the ""sanctuary"" I once had now seems like a toxic wasteland ready to send me to the dirt. If anyone knows anything...please clarify?",environment,1575089892,n0irre,10,1,True,2019-11-29 23:58:12

Graduated from NYU, Led an AI team in California for 4 years, until 2017 end.

2 years earlier, following intuition, I quit my well paying job as AI/Data Science lead in Silicon Valley. And through this journey I explored the top meaningful problems to solve for humanity. After connecting several dots, earlier this year I arrived at that sustainability/climate change is the biggest challenge facing whole humanity, it is way bigger challenge than most people realise. And we must act fast.

Therefore, I have committed my rest of life on this cause. It has not been easy keep rejecting cushy job offers that kept coming all the time.

Question about coal consumption and electric cars. Looking for information.,"I’m writing an essay about how electric cars are providing a way to reduce the amount of pollution we emit into the air. My essay is more focused on how companies are involved in helping improve the environment, but I have a question relating to coal power and I am hoping someone here may know were I can find information that will help my paper.

As I understand it. The idea is that if we replace cars that use gas with EVs, that should reduce the output of toxins into the air. However, this would mean that electricity outputs could do up as people have to charge their cars. Right now, a large portion (the majority if I’m correct) of electricity comes from coal sources power plants.

If we get our power from coal, then that would mean we would still be (until these plants were replaced or retrofitted) using coal and other fuels that still emit Co2 and toxins.

My question is do we know if this just means we are moving the source of toxins, and not really reducing the output? I am sure it’s logical to assume that even if the plants used more fuel that it would be offset by the reduction of cars, but how much of a reduction and is it enough to say it’s worth the cost of moving to a new power source?

I’m not asking to say we shouldn’t be trying to find cleaner ways. I believe that even if I fully doubted climate change that innovation is a good thing and we have reason enough to move past coal. I also believe that if I am going to make the argument that things like electric vehicles are going to happen, I need to make the argument knowing what people might counter with, and I have face this argument that we are still dependent on coal and it doesn’t solve anything.

Any help or explains would be great. If there is another forum or area that this question would be better suited for please let me know.",environment,1575225260,Cheatcodechamp,10,1,True,2019-12-01 13:34:20

Study: White People Responsible for Blacks’ and Latinos’ Higher Exposure to Pollution,"A study in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* claims that white people contribute more to pollution than black and Latino people, but the latter suffer from it more than the white polluters.

“The air that Americans breathe isn’t equal,” *USA Today* says in its [report](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/11/air-pollution-inequality-minorities-breathe-air-polluted-whites/3130783002/) on the study.

“Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately breathe air that’s been polluted by non-Hispanic whites, according to a study,” *USA Today* says. “This new research quantifies for the first time the racial gap between who causes air pollution – and who breathes it.”

The[ study](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/05/1818859116) is available online, including a portion entitled “significance.”

&gt;Racial–ethnic disparities in pollution exposure and in consumption of goods and services in the United States are well documented. Some may find it intuitive that, on average, black and Hispanic minorities bear a disproportionate burden from the air pollution caused mainly by non-Hispanic whites, but this effect has not previously been directly established, let alone quantified. Our “pollution inequity” metric is generalizable to other pollution types and provides a simple and intuitive way of expressing a disparity between the pollution that people cause and the pollution to which they are exposed. Our results are timely, given public debate on issues relating to race, equity, and the regulation of pollution.

*USA Today* reports that 100,000 Americans die from pollution a year, more “than car crashes and murders combined,” although the exact causes of death and how it relates to pollution are not explained.

“Even though minorities are contributing less to the overall problem of air pollution, they are affected by it more,” Jason Hill, an engineering professor at the University of Minnesota and co-author of the study says in the *USA Today* report, which notes that he is white.

“Is it fair (that) I create more pollution and somebody else is disproportionately affected by it?” Hill says.

“What is especially surprising is just how large pollution inequity is and has been for well over a decade,” Hill says.

The type of pollution analyzed in the study is PM 2.5 — grains of particulate matter that are smaller than the width of a human hair, according to *USA Today*. They are present in car exhaust, from power plants, and burning materials.

A Letter to EPA Region 5 Director | Let's Talk!,"Dear Reddit, 

I addressed the following letter to EPA Region 5 Director, Mr. Ken McQueen, but thought that it would also be good to spark some conversation here. Let's talk! What are you thoughts/opinions on this topic? 

&gt;I am writing to you today in great concern regarding the state of our national environmental affairs. Upon my initial review of the EPA’s FY 2018-2022 U.S. EPA Strategic Plan, I felt the agency was headed in the right direction towards fulfilling their mission to protect human health and the environment. However, subsequent revisions and rereads of the document have me concerned that the EPA’s actions (or lack thereof) may be putting human health and the environment at further risk. I am writing to you today in hopes of voicing the concerns of not only U.S. citizens, but also the global community.  
&gt;  
&gt;The greatest impediment for the EPA’s mission statement has been the conflict of interest shared among the officials at the agency and Trump administration. In recent years, this has been showcased by: (1) the hiring of officials \[at the EPA\] with a long known history and ties in petroleum and coal industries (who fail to strike a balance between independent and societal goals) (2) the absence of any mention towards energy or petroleum in the FY 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, and (3) anti-competitive actions taken by the EPA in the energy transition. I find these acts to not only be inappropriate but also a threat to our national security.   
&gt;  
&gt;The EPA’s decision to not act against the Trump Administration rolling back regulations that limit industry emissions has been a blatant attack on the \[green\] energy transition and national security of the United States. Our dependence on fossil fuels for economic and energy stability is the biggest threat we must face with an ambitious energy transition. According to the EIA, of the 101.3 quadrillion Btu consumed in the USA in 2018, 36.9 quadrillion Btu were sourced from petroleum and a further 44.2 Btu from other fossil fuels. Additionally, according to data provided by the United Nations Statistical Division, petroleum accounted for 9.4% of U.S. exports and 8.6% of U.S. imports. This dependency means that any threat to our petroleum supplies would be destructive and have us relive events such as the 1973 oil crisis or put us back in another war for oil. For the energy market, rolling back industry regulations is anti-competitive and conducive to the market growth of renewable energy sector.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also feel the need to reiterate the fact that this energy transition, if sustained and not faced with anti-competitive actions, will improve grid efficiency, reduce air/water/ground pollution, help to securely lay the path for future power generation, and improve the quality of life of the average American (all things outlined in the EPA’s FY 2018-2022 U.S. EPA Strategic Plan).  
&gt;  
&gt;This, along with other factors, brings me to question the true interests of the EPA and their mission statement. By choosing to actively censor scientific information about climate change, preventing states from enforcing higher air quality standards, illegally withdrawing Clean Water Act protections, and failing to protect public/private lands from disastrous drilling operations, my dreams to one day work for the EPA have been challenged. Does this agency truly represent the core American values it claims to? Does this agency exist to serve the American people or a just a select few of rapacious stakeholders? If it does exist to serve core American values and people, why do their actions speak otherwise?",environment,1575342319,ProdigyNerd,0,1,True,2019-12-02 22:05:19

Factory’s Foul Stench Has Evanston Neighbors Demanding A Solution; ‘Don’t Take No For An Answer’,"Six months after the state inspection, Tapecoat was hit with an air pollution violation. The notice specifically mentioned numerous citizen complaints. 

The Illinois Attorney General’s office could take on the case if the EPA ultimately determines Tapecoat isn’t trying hard enough to eliminate the stench.

"Avoiding 1.5°C increase in global temperatures seems extremely difficult, if not impossible.","Here's a news piece from the 31 January 2019 Nature magazine word for word:

&gt;Per capita carbon emissions must fall to 1955 levels  
&gt;  
&gt;Gregg Marland, Tom Oda &amp; Thomas A. Boden  
&gt;  
&gt;**The findings of the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report imply that we need to reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide within 12 years to where they were 41 years ago, to avoid a 1.5 °C increase in average Earth surface temperature.** Global emissions and concentrations are still rising, however, so temperatures continue to go up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our estimates show that emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement manufacture in 2017 surpassed 10 gigatonnes of carbon (see [go.nature.com/2teyafi](http://go.nature.com/2teyafi)). Population growth is partly responsible. In 1977, when the global population was 4.23 billion, emissions per capita were 1.19 tonnes of carbon per person. By 2017, this had increased to 1.34 tonnes (the global population that year was 7.55 billion). **So, decreasing total emissions to the 1977 figure will mean returning per capita emissions to those recorded for 1955.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth in industrialization and population distributions also increase carbon emissions. Emissions are still high from countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany, which industrialized early. Top emitters now also include China, India, Iran, Brazil and South Africa. The distribution within countries is also changing as urbanization and transportation increase (see [go.nature.com/2hwpia3](http://go.nature.com/2hwpia3)).  
&gt;  
&gt;We need to make drastic changes in carbon emissions, soon. This means widespread global cooperation and unprecedented commitment.

My first thought to this is ""that is obviously never going to happen"", but I'd rather keep up delusional hope than be that harsh. But it's hard to understand and properly put to words how incredibly, extremely challenging that will be.",environment,1575471582,A_Seeker_of_truths,0,1,True,2019-12-04 09:59:42
"I’m Bobby Magill, an environment reporter. I’ll be on the ground covering the COP25 climate talks in Madrid. AMA!","I report on climate change and federal energy and public lands policy, including endangered species, land use and energy development—both fossil fuels and renewables for Bloomberg Environment. I track the implementation of the Paris climate agreement, advancements in renewable energy policy and technology, climate science, oil and gas leasing on U.S. federal lands, implementation of the Endangered Species Act and developments at the intersection of energy and climate change.
I covered the 2018 UN climate talks—COP24—in Poland, and this week, I’ll be traveling to Spain to cover the second week of COP25 in Madrid. Before starting at Bloomberg Environment, I covered energy and climate at Climate Central in New York City for four years, and spent more than a decade reporting on natural resources and federal lands at local newspapers in Colorado and New Mexico. This week, I wrap up a three-year stint as president of the Society of Environmental Journalists. 

What would you like to know? How important are this year’s UN climate talks given that it’s in 2020 when countries are required to come back to the table with new commitments to cut carbon? What’s up with the U.S. pulling out of Paris? Can the U.S. return to Paris if Trump loses in 2020? And even if countries do make big carbon cuts, is it really going to put the brakes on climate change?

This land could be used to produce food in a sustainable way.

In the future we will need to change how we produce food and perhaps luxaries like alcohol need to be reduced?

If we are to save the planet and maintain our population perhaps we can not afford to dedicate so much land to alcohol production.

The only problem is I'm not sure what to call it!!! 'Sustainable Flat Guide' sounds super lame and will no doubt turn people off to it, so I'm tossing up what a better, more catchy name might be. I feel like 'sustainability' as a word is really overused...

Any suggestions???

"Climate change is a major issue, but it's not a threat to humanity.","This is an issue that I've seen way too often on this subreddit. 

Climate change is a huge issue. It threatens biodiversity, the safety of coastal settlements, and most of the ocean as we know it. Climate change does not, however, threaten humanity as a whole.  The human race is not going to go extinct. 

Stop touting the concept that if we don't act on climate change, we're all going to die. It's uneducated and deligitimizes the green movement as a whole. 

Rising sea levels are not going to kill us, we can migrate or build sea walls. Fewer species is not going to kill us, we just might have to survive off of different foods than normal. The death of coral reefs is not going to kill us. 

The only effect of climate change that threatens us is the reduced production of oxygen which, is being solved as we speak. Sinuous honestly think that any government is going to watch humanity suffocate? We can plant more trees is Northern areas; we can produce our own oxygen. It will be more monetarily expensive, but not the end of the world. 

Climate change has real, extremely important impacts. The oceans are being bleached, the forests are being burned, and biodiversity is being destroyed before our eyes. These issues should be enough to convince anybody to act on climate change. They are why climate change needs to be stopped. 

Stop touting false information. Saying that humanitybis going to die from climate change is patently false. It's a scare tactic. It's propoganda. You don't need lies to support your argument when the facts are on your side. By spreading these lies, you make our whole argument seem peas trustworthy. You give power and credence to climate deniers/skeptics.

Recycling question- rinse out material or not?,"Hello all,

My roommate and I are having a disagreement on the best way to recycle. Currently, he does not rinse out most of his plastic containers that he sends to the recycle; or, if he does they are not rinsed out all the way. He explained that the energy required to ""warm"" the rinse water in the sink, and the water itself used to rinse the item out does not outweigh the benefit of the material saved.

My question, is there an equilibrium for water saved and material saved? Is it better to fully rinse out an item, or use a little less water? My thinking is its better to clean out the material fully, so more of the material is saved.

He also argues that many places are not actually recycling the recyclables, as the market is currently not great for it. Still, we might as well try recycling, right?

It only happens a few times per decade and can change the global circulation and weather patterns, sending winter weather into mid-latitudes.","A stratospheric warming event is set to start over Siberia in about 10 days. This is an event where temperatures rise in the top and medium levels of the stratosphere (25-45km altitude). This warming weakens the stratospheric polar vortex, which drives the circumpolar jet stream, and if weakened or even collapsed by the warming, it can significantly change the weather pattern across the northern hemisphere. If you happen to live in Europe or North America, and you love winter, then this is an event ordered for you. It is proven that major stratospheric warming events raise pressure over the north pole, which means that the cold polar air can escape the polar circle more easily, going south into Europe or the United States.

It's a bid of a morbid thought, but is it healthy for the earth to balance the amount of births/deaths in such a way? If we get to the point where most of the deaths on the earth are from old age or accidents then the number of births per day outweighs is significantly and the population will grow exponentially.

Amazon Rainforest: It doesn’t Produce 20% of the Planet’s Oxygen,"So, we all came across a number of photos, videos, and articles that state **Amazon Rainforest** produces 20% of the planet’s oxygen. Right? But what if I say, this is a pure misconception?

Well,  I am a curious soul so I decided to take a look and do my part of  research regarding this claimed number. I watched more than 30 videos,  read 15+ articles, few research papers, listened to 2-3 podcasts and  collected 15 pages of data, from which, this blog is developed. (hard  work, eh)

I want you guys to clear the clouds of this  misinformation which is hovering over your head. Amazon rainforest has  nothing to do with the world’s oxygen but it is indeed as cardinal as  oxygen. Having said that, it is ironical to see that one of nature’s  species (humans) is destroying it for its endless greed.

**In  this blog, you will not only read about the original oxygen percentage  but will also know, how the amazon rainforest holds the rich array of  life that exists on earth and what vital role does it play to keep our  planet healthy.**

## First, let’s know a little about Amazon Rainforest –

Amazon  Jungle is the world’s largest tropical rainforest stretched out in  about 5.5 million square kilometers, an area half the size of Europe.  And yes, Brazil is home to more than half of the amazon rainforest. The  amazon has been there for at least 55 million years.

Amazon  Rainforest wakes up regularly with more than 1300 bird species, 3000  types of fishes, 2.5 million distinct insects and approx. 430 species of  mammals. According to WWF, **“Amazon has more types of ants on one tree than some entire countries.”** Interesting! Isn’t it?

It’s  believed about three million different species of plants and animals – 1  out of 10 species in the world – live in the Amazon. Out of which, one  is the [amazon river dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_river_dolphin). This fascinating creature is famed for the pinkish color it acquires as it gets older, from which came its name **‘Pink Dolphin’.**

##### Now, it’s time to reveal the truth behind the oxygen theory.

Well, I am sure you have read about photosynthesis and respiration when you were in high school. Still, let’s recap a little.

As  mentioned in LiveScience, “Photosynthesis takes in the carbon dioxide  produced by all breathing organisms and reintroduces oxygen into the  atmosphere. While during respiration at night, plants consume more than  half of the oxygen they produced during the day.” **In the case of the Amazon rainforest, trees breath in more than half of the oxygen they produce.**

As  told by Scott Denning, Professor of atmospheric science, Colorado State  University, “Trees constantly shed dead leaves, twigs, roots and other  litter, which feeds a rich ecosystem of organisms, mostly insects and  microbes. The microbes consume the remaining oxygen in that process.  Forest plants produce lots of oxygen, and forest microbes consume a lot  of oxygen. **As a result, net production of oxygen by forests – and indeed, all land plants – is very close to zero.”**

As  the biochemist, Nick Lane mentioned in his book ‘Oxygen’, “Even the  foolhardiest destruction of world forests could hardly dint our oxygen  supply.”

I hope you got the point and understood that Amazon  Rainforest has nothing to do with the world’s oxygen but again, it  doesn’t mean we can afford losing Amazon Rainforest. We seriously can’t!  And you will know why, in the coming content.

**Now the question is – From where does the planet secure its oxygen?**  Well, most of the oxygen source is the ocean and not the forests. The  oxygen we intake is the upshot of marine plants such as phytoplankton  which includes algae, cyanobacteria, and kelp, which brings life to the  atmosphere.

**And about the title ‘Lungs of the Planet’.**  As we all know, the lungs purify the air, so does the amazon. It  filters the air we breathe. Hence, the Amazon rainforest is the world’s  largest ‘air purifier’ and that’s the reason it is called ‘Lungs of the  Planet’.

## Let’s know more about Amazon Rainforest –

&amp;#x200B;

* **Food and other products–**

Close  to 80% of the food we eat, actually comes from rainforests. For example  Coffee, Chocolate, rice, tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, corn, black  pepper, pineapples etcetera. **And around 30,000 fruits can be found in rainforests.**

But  they also offer a vast variety of products that many of us use on a  daily basis. Tropical forest oils, gums, and resins are used in  insecticides, rubber products, fuel, paint, varnish, and wood finishing  products. And tropical oils are key ingredients in cosmetics, soaps,  shampoos, perfumes, disinfectants, and detergents.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Medicinal Value –**

Amazon  Rainforest is indeed ‘The World’s Largest Medicine Center’. It is home  to more than 40,000 plant species and around 25% of all drugs are  derived from rainforest plants.”

From the Cinchona tree which is  used in developing medicine for malaria to the Lapacho tree that helps  in cancer, the Amazon rainforest is filled with remedies. **In fact, the medicinal discovery in rainforests has just begun and has a long way to go.**

Scientists  say, “Less than one percent of all the species have been properly  examined for medical potential.” They use different snake venoms, molds,  plants and flowers which can only be found in Amazon Rainforest; hence  it acts as a medical lab for a number of deadly diseases.

Moreover,  Scientists also believe that somewhere in the Amazon forest lies the  antidote for cancer and some more incurable diseases. **That’s just one of the many reasons why we can’t afford losing the Amazon rainforest.**

Just so you know, Amazon is one of the greatest libraries of nature on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Rainfall –**

According  to the WWF Panda organization, “Every year, Amazon receives torrential  rainfall between 1500mm to 3000mm. Eastern trade winds that blow from  the Atlantic Ocean account for about half of the rainfall, with the  other half due to evapotranspiration (the process by which water is  transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil  and by transpiration from plants).”

**A single tree can  transpire more than 200 gallons (760 liters) of water, per year, and  once that water is back in the atmosphere, it falls again.**  Without the Amazon rainforest, there won’t be sufficient rainfall even  in the close regions. Rainfall needs rainforest as much as rainforest  needs rainfall.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Importance of Trees –**

Forests  cover about 31% of the planet and they play an essential role in  supporting life on earth. Deforestation is stripping the earth’s forest  with a monstrous pace. With the current rate of destruction, the world’s  rainforest could completely vanish in the next 100 years.

The  estimated number of trees in the Amazon rainforest is around 400 billion  that belong to more than 16,000 different species and these 400 billion  trees store 2 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide. **Trees act as  a shield against further climate change by absorbing C02 from the  atmosphere that inflames global warming, which is a pretty big deal.**

**The world is already on the verge of death but the rainforests like amazon are keeping it alive. Let’s save it!**

I've decided to either only buy eco candles from now on or have a go at making my own.

Things to look out for are essential oils to fragrance and wax made of rapeseed (vegetable oil), coconut or soy. However I'm going to avoid soy as it's linked to rainforest destruction.

Here Are 3 Climategate Myths That Have Not Aged Well,""" 

Excessive media coverage of an email hacking tilted the outcome of a critically important event against the victims of the crime. Sound familiar?

In 2016, it happened [to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37639370) and the [Democratic National Committee](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/how-the-russians-hacked-the-dnc-and-passed-its-emails-to-wikileaks/2018/07/13/af19a828-86c3-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html). That was déjà vu for climate scientists, who seven years earlier had experienced a nearly identical chain of events leading up to the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. 

In summary: [emails from the University of East Anglia in the UK were hacked](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/11/the-cru-hack/), and many journalists assumed that where there was smoke, there must be fire. Even [the Daily Show’s Jon Stewart](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/v9n1tt/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-scientists-hide-global-warming-data) jumped on the bandwagon, accusing climate scientists of trying to “trick you” based on a few selective, out-of-context quotes from the hacked emails (though he also later [ripped the media](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jon-stewart-climategate-debunkin-media-mcrib_n_1034792) for not covering the debunking of the Climategate myth). Commentators at the time were divided over whether this was a media storm, or just a storm in a very British teacup.

Nonetheless, the Copenhagen climate summit a few weeks later was widely [considered a failure](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal). That wasn’t only because of the hacked emails, just as another cache of emails aren’t the sole reason for the words “President Donald Trump” — but in both cases the media-amplified story played a significant role in shaping subsequent events. 

[***Nine separate inquiries***](https://skepticalscience.com/Climategate-CRU-emails-hacked.htm) ***into the email hack exonerated the climate scientists, but came well after the damage had been done. And a decade on, many of the climate science denial myths that emerged from the email hack are still in play.***

So, on the 10th anniversary of what came to be known as ‘Climategate’, let’s examine three of the key email quotes that so captured the media’s attention, and how the associated science has since evolved.

Spoiler: the deniers’ lies haven’t aged well.

Now look at what these same deniers are doing to show support of our dear leader with the same outline of lies originating from Putin himself.

Idea to reimagine drought affected farms to help the planet and get carbon credits,"If you’re not aware already. Parts of Australia are facing the worst drought in centuries. And it seems likely that long term there may be little chance of reliable rainfall ever returning so farmers can grow pastures for cows, sheep and other livestock.
But I was talking to some mates at the pub and I ran an idea past them: why not we organise to buy up some unviable farm land and plant hardy tree and bush species which are fire tolerant and can survive the almost permanent drought conditions in many parts!
I was thinking it would repurpose the farms to something good for the environment. Becoming a carbon sink, returning native animal habitats and perhaps even returning the land to the original owners, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia!
If anyone thinks this is a good idea and has tips on how to make it a reality please let me know! I want dreams to become reality and to help the planet :)
One idea I had was to pool resources and find a place somewhere where we could dry seed the place with quick growing hardy varieties of  casuarinas, acacias (wattles), and maybe even have some space for some more ‘commercial’ crop experiments like agave for ‘tequila’ (noting you can’t call it that if it isn’t from regions in Jalisco, Mexico and a few other areas in Mexico).",environment,1574547352,GreenPaddocks,2,1,True,2019-11-23 17:15:52

**I support the earth** 💪

As we know the time to act is now. But action isn't easy especially for individuals. Today it's our turn to save this nature, to give it back the protection that it had always provided us with.

Truly, the Global Warming is Happening and We are the Primary Cause. 

So how can we face it ? I think the next step we should take as individuals is to spread the idea of standing beside the earth, the nature. We should show the whole world that we are supporting our Mother 'nature' and we will do whatever it takes to save it!

Some questions about the recent wildfires.,"I was wondering the following things, appreciate if somebody here has some information: (Sorry if these things were asked before)

1) Is there scientific data that can show an increase in wildfire frequency over the last years? Something similar to the clear depiction of the increase in athmosperic CO2 concentration or increase in average temperature.
(It is maybe not trivial to define a good measure for wildfires)

2) How big is the feedback effect that wildfires have in terms of CO2 emissions? I mean, the wood gets burned which releases CO2, but as many have pointed out: this, together with the regrowth of plants is a natural and often even necessary process. But on the long run, can we say that a forrest that burns down more often does capture less CO2 in its trees over time because they are on average smaller?

3) If this effect exists, did the well known climate models incorporate it? I mean I have often heard of the viscious cycle when melting permafrost releases methane and other such cycles. But have not yet heard about such considerations with wildfires.

4) Similar question: Did they also consider wildfires when calculating the damage that must be expected? So far I have mostly read about drought (which I consider much worse than the rise in sea level) but wouldnt wildfires increase the damage to nature and agriculture even more?

I am asking all of these because I am just surprised how the rise of reported wildfires seems much faster than other effects, and I wonder if this will continue. Or if maybe it is really mostly an increase in public/media awareness (thus the first question).",environment,1574612894,andWan,2,1,True,2019-11-24 11:28:14

Hello,

Currently, I have gotten into a jam. My job suddenly let me go right before the rent period.  I've been seeking to get hired on with other companies, but it has been a slow process. I've picked up a  gig to help get through, However, the work has not been coming in enough to get near my goals. I haven't been able to bring in the funding for my monthly obligations at the moment such as rent (which is overdue and I'm facing eviction), car payment (couple months behind), I have not been able to get near my goals, where I normally would be had I not of dealt with the work stoppage. While I'm currently seeking other employment right now. Its the 13th &amp; rent was due on the 1st. I'm nowhere near where I need to be. Please help me to become current. I can really use your help! If you have any questions feel free to reach out. Thank You. I have exhausted all my resources and I have no other alternatives other than to ask for assistance. **Anything you can donate is greatly appreciated. Thank You.**

Plastic Is Turning Food Toxic,"**Chicken eggs in Indonesia are laced with dioxins and PCBs.**

One ounce of dioxin can kill 1 million people.

Do you remember the good old days when you thought recycling was good?

That was before you leaned your e-waste and plastic weren't recycled at all, it was shipped to Asia.

Of course the poisoning of your food doesn't start with plastic waste. Your food is contained by plastic leaching into it before you eat it. In the old days, our grandparents were poisoned by lead from canned food. Nowadays we're poisoned by the thin film of plastic that lines the can. That poison is screwing up your endocrine system. Your endocrine is what makes you male or female. The male sex is being assaulted from all sides chemically. Everything from pesticides to PFAS are destroying all vertebrate males. This may not seem important to you, but the effects of this poisoning are transgenerationally epigenetic, meaning this will affect your kids and grand kids. The effects are also cumulative, unstoppable and irreversible with continued exposure. The good news is that this plastic and chemical poisoning is killing our sperm, so you are very unlikely to actually produce offspring, which is good during a time of civilizational collapse. The people of northern Europe burn their plastic for electricity, along with waste paper products and trees. They call this green energy, because you get paid green bucks for burning green trees. Burning palm oil in cars is also called green energy because Nords are self-deceitful. Nords think they are green because they ship all their plastic and e-waste to Asia.

The Mitigation of Climate Change Through the Greenification of Animal Agriculture 

 

Micah Eckert December 11, 2018 

  

Micah Eckert Brennan, B SES-4U0-01 Space Science 

Today I can walk into any McDonalds in the world and buy a quarter pounder for the equivalent price of 3.75 CAD (McDonalds, 2018). While some people are aware of the ethical impacts of meat consumption, the environmental are often not discussed. Most know little about the global footprint of our dietary choices, and even less about how they are coming back to haunt us. Reducing the carbon footprint of the meat industry, and decreasing meat consumption is required to partially mitigate climate change. Climate change is the global impact of rapid heating of the earth’s atmosphere caused by human activity. Meat is an important part of people’s diet, but overconsumption of low-cost meats and the way they are produced is environmentally unsound. The meat industry harms the environment; however, those environmental costs are not included in what people pay for it. As the global population grows, so does the demand for more meat at a low price (UNEP, 2012). A side product of industrial animal agricultural is high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHGs absorb and trap heat in the atmosphere in molecular bonds. An anthropogenic accumulation of these gases has increased the global temperature, which has resulted in ocean levels rising, irregular storm patterns, unpredictable outbreaks of animal-vectored diseases, and the degradation of habitat due to wide climate fluctuations. 



While there are many sources of GHG emission, meat consumption and its emissions can readily be reduced. 10 percent of Canada’s GHG emissions are directly related to agriculture, and half of those emissions are from meat production  
 (Wickramasinghe, 2013). This varies 

between 15-20 percent among developed  
 countries (Wickramasinghe, 2013).  
 Worldwide, humans consume much more  
 meat than we need in our diet. According  
 to an article published by Jennie  
 Macdiarmid (Macdiarmid, 2013), the average person consumes more than double the meat recommended in a healthy balanced diet (See figure 2). The most effective way of reducing the GHG emissions related to meat production is, therefore, to decrease the amount of meat consumed. Although vegetarianism is most effective; radical alteration of diet is unrealistic, and positive effects could result from a slight decrease in individual meat consumption. There are also several key adaptations that would reduce emissions related to animal agriculture. The major contributors to GHG emissions from meat production are transportation, digestive gas produced by cattle, and deforestation. As well as diverging personal consumption to avoid beef and other red meats. 

The transportation of agricultural products makes up 9 percent of all vehicles on the road (EPA, 2018). In the production of meat; grain is brought to a livestock farm, live stock is brought to a slaughter house, meat is brought to factories or to stores, and cars bring food from stores to 

  

Figure 2. Representation of a heathy diet (Wickramasinghe, 2013) 

  

houses. This can be seen in the systems diagram I have created (Figure 3). While the meat industry requires multiple stages of transportation (e.g. from grain farm to meat farm to slaughter house), less fuel is spent on the direct transport of grain to distribution locations. 

 

Figure 3. Systems diagram of the transportation of products throughout the meat industry. 

This has the potential in local situations to lessen the fuel consumption by calories. While not many cows can fit into a truck, enough grain can to completely fill the truck from floor to roof. To reduce the emissions in transportation, a switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles would be in order. Although it is not yet available to the public, an alternative for heavy load transport is becoming available. This year, Tesla CEO Elon musk unveiled his new project; the tesla Semi, a fully electric 18-wheeler truck designed to carry heavy loads. One utilized in large scale industry, 

  

this truck could be an alternative to heavy  
 load livestock carrying vehicles (Torque,  
 2018). While this does not only involve the  
 meat industry; CO2 emissions from  
 transportation can be decreased by simply  
 decreasing the distance food has to travel  
 before it ends up in our local stores. This can  
 be decreased by shopping locally.  
 Transportation makes up 11 percent of GHG emissions from the global food industry, 7 percent of these can be prevented by shopping locally (See figure 4) (TerraPass, 2018). Transportation is broken down into two sections, supply chain transport, which is the distribution of food throughout the world or a country, and final delivery transport, which is the transportation of food from distribution areas (e.g. markets, grocery stores) to homes. Supply chain transport accounts for 7 percent of total GHG emissions in the global food industry, while final delivery only accounts for the final 4 percent (TerraPass, 2018). This means by localizing your food (includes meat), you are skipping the distribution stage, and instead receiving meat locally. 

Since the meat industry deals with living organisms, waste is inevitable. The average beef cow produces 908 kg of manure a year (Ferguson, 2018). Accounting for all mature cows in Canada, a collective 3.36x109 kg of manure are put into the environment a year (Statista, 2018). Has a costly impact on the environment as it contributes to the levels of Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere. However nitrous oxide is not the only problem. Methane is released by cows as 

 

Figure 4. Emissions breakdown (TerraPass, 2018) 

  

passing gas through the mouth and anus. In the news, people often hear CO2; the worst GHG, but little do we hear about methane,  
 which is produced in vast quantities by  
 livestock. According to scientist Sam 

Lemonick, methane is “85 more  
 effective at trapping heat” in our  
 atmosphere than CO2 (Lemonick,  
 2017). Methane is a natural product of  
 a cow’s digestive system. It is produced  
 in the gut (Lemonick, 2017) by special microbes called methanogens. It plays an important role in the fermentation of nutrients traveling thought the digestive tract (Lemonick, 2017). Historically, this posed no threat to the environment, however since the vast breading of livestock for cheap commercial purposes, populations have grown and so has methane emissions. In Canada alone, there are 3.71 million beef cows (Statista, 2018), each producing 100kg (Skeptical, 2015) of methane a year. Recent research done at the University of California studies the effects of a partial seaweed diet on the methane producing microbes in a cow digestive system. The research found that a partial seaweed diet (1% seaweed), implemented into a cows regular feed, results in a decrease in the individuals methane emissions by half (Kennedy, 2018). According to professor Ermias Kebreab, “the seaweed can inhibit an enzyme that's involved in producing methane in a cow's gut” (Kennedy, 2018). This process, if integrated into our cattle industry, can cut methane emissions in Canada by half. 

 

Figure 5. Methane Emissions from 75’ to 2015 (Skeptical, 2015) 

  

To run a successful farm you need water, food, and most of all lots and lots of space. Continuously with more farms switching to ethical free-range practices, farms are requiring more space for the cattle to roam.  
 While I support ethical  
 practices in the meat industry,  
 this correlates to further  
 deforestation to increase the  
 grazing area. In the 1990s, the  
 world forests shrank by 94,000  
 (FAO, 2015) square km to make room for cattle farming, and only cattle. All species in the kingdom plantae use CO2 in the process of making energy known as photosynthesis. What most don’t know is the sheer extent to how much plants absorb globally of CO2 a year. According to an article written by Peter Reich, the forests of the world sequester “around 4 billion tonnes of carbon per year” (PhysOrg, 2013), this is “equivalent to almost 60% of emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production combined” (PhysOrg, 2013). Since CO2 is a GHG, reducing its presence in the atmosphere result in slowing down global warming. To minimalize deforestation, the crops/livestock with the largest yield of calories in an acre are used to maximize the use of a plot of land. In one acre of land, enough cows to supply 1.1 million calories of beef could be farmed. In the same plot (1 acre) you could instead grow 17.8 million calories of potatoes, or 17x more energy than could be harnessed from 1 acre of beef.  
 Many large-scale changes must be made to mitigate the global rise in temperature. However small-scale changes to individual diets have a huge effect on our personal contributions to the 

 

Figure 6. Calories per acre of land use. Information gathered from (Anna, 2014) 

  

fight against climate change. Overtime, a simple choice to reduce certain meats from your diet you make a prodigious difference. According to an article of Green Eatz (GreenEatz, 2018) outlining the equivalent GHG emissions per kilo gram of meat produce, lamb and beef are the highest emitters at 39.2 and 27 kilogram of emissions per kilogram of meat. The meats with the lowest emissions are chicken and fish, giving off 6.9 and 6.1 kilograms respectively (GreenEatz, 2018). This proves that better choice for a meat diet would be to primarily consume chicken and fish, however these do not fall in the same ball park as fruits and nuts, which emit 1.1 and 2.3 kilograms (GreenEatz, 2018) respectively, per kilogram produced. In terms of the highest collective emissions, beef it the main culprit. Individually, cows are responsible for less general GHG emissions than lambs, however are more commercialized and abundant in population. According to an article on The Guardian (Carrington, 2014) written by Damian Carrington, by giving up a portion of the meat in your diet, you are doing more for the environment in terms of reducing GHG emissions than giving up driving your car. 

In the words of David Attenborough, lifelong environmentalist and scientist, “The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now” (McGrath, 2018). Climate change isn’t a localized event, it’s global. For action to be taken, we need the powerhouses of the modern world to make immediate and radical changes. Along with this we need to average person to make a difference in their own lives. This can be done by choosing your meats, cutting back, and localizing your shopping. Other changes like must be done to alter our otherwise inevitable radical climate change, such as reducing transportation, preventing deforestation by the implementation of dense crops (potatoes), and 

  

swaying the market away from beef. To follow these requirements would help the world come one step further towards the mitigation of climate change.

How one startup is solving for food waste in grocery stores!,"Being green isn’t the only reason for companies to get on board. Retailers that find ways to minimize food surpluses will reap financial rewards too.

**Grocery retails of the future need to embrace innovation, and be agile with the implementation of it.** The grocery retail is a low-margin business facing disruption from the likes of [Amazon](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/amazon-to-open-its-first-non-whole-foods-grocery-store-in-2020/amp/). Sure, some of the grocers have launched their own [innovation labs/hubs](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/h-e-b-build-new-tech-innovation-lab), but the retail industry has now morphed into the tech industry, and it's now a race!

With 50% of consumers complaining that grocery stores haven’t figured out how to use technology like other retailers, according to a survey by [Phononic](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005044/en/Phononic-Survey-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Preferences-Grocery-%E2%80%9CStore), grocers around the world should be looking for ways to introduce cutting-edge technology and unconventional ways to improve consumer journey to purchase.

[Wasteless](http://www.wasteless.com/), is doing just that; reducing food waste and saving consumers money, with the help of AI. 

The startup created a turnkey, SaaS software solution, for supermarkets, to manage their stocks, and reduce food prices, as shelf life dwindles. The process inspires customers to take part in the war against food waste, while at the same time enjoying better prices, and an overall shopping experience.

Wasteless AI software allows customers to choose between the nearing expiration or fresher food, at different prices. If you are going to eat or cook the item today or tomorrow, why does it matter if it expires in 3 days or 10 days? And why shouldn't the price reflect this in realtime for a better shopping experience?

![video](bacw314e4iz31 ""Most uneaten food ends up in the dump. When food waste decomposes in a landfill without oxygen, this creates an anaerobic sequence that produces the methane, which is approximately 20 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.  This in turn contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer, which can lead to higher temperatures around the globe."")

**Consumers are craving something different.** There are many reasons that consumers care about wasted food. Some prioritize the issue because of their feelings about health and the environment, and others just don’t like throwing money away. But concern about waste is everywhere. 

[**According to market research firm Nielsen:**](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/more-than-half-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-sustainable-products-designed-to-be-reused-or-recycled-accenture-survey-finds.htm)

* 83% of consumes thought it was important for companies to have environmental programs.

[**According to CSB’s data:**](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/NYU%20Stern%20CSB%20Sustainable%20Share%20Index%E2%84%A2%202019.pdf)

* Sustainability-marketed products outperformed their conventional counterparts.

By implementing Wasteless end-to-end solution, one Italian retailer [cut down waste levels by half, and increased product margins by 1.2 percentage points, boosting their brand image and keeping freshness at the optimal level.](https://www.wasteless.com/Bs.WebApp.Models.SuccessStories/1/document.pdf)

Whether it’s through use of technology or finding creative ways to lure more shoppers to their store, it’s worth investing in solutions focused on food-waste reduction, and there is every reason to feed this ambition.",environment,1574107598,IlyaMovshovich,1,1,True,2019-11-18 15:06:38

Professor brought up interesting point about vegetarianism in class today,"So I'm in Environmental Biology this semester (a class that's really gotten me interested in helping the environment/learning more about it because of the professor). Our professor goes on rants all the time in class about how we're destroying the planet and what we should do to help, etc. He's super passionate about nature and the environment. Today he was teaching us about the effects of farming and agriculture and brought up the scenario of the entire world going vegetarian/vegan. 

I think he said that a huge chunk (I think he said half) the land we use for farming could potentially be used for planting trees/restoring some nature. He was also talking about the gasses the meat industry uses, etc. He added that this could potentially fix just about every problem we're having with the environment. He did add though that there is pretty much a 0% chance of that happening. I know for SURE he's right about that.

* Prevents black ice?

**Disadvantages:**

* The mess/trying to clean up the sand

[Argument] We should research/develop/deploy more modern nuclear power plants independent of the costs of renewables for the time being.,"Why?  Some of the 4th generation or later reactor designs that are being researched and developed are supposed to be far more resilient and safe to operate, and more importantly, can reuse nuclear waste as a fuel source, reducing the need to ""store"" such waste from thousands of years to say, several hundred years.  In this light, it would actually be astonishingly irresponsible from an environmental standpoint NOT to employ advanced nuclear reactors for power.  It is another non carbon emitting tool in the power generation toolbox, and we can reduce the current waste half life of much of the waste that is just sitting around.  

&amp;#x200B;

That waste is not going anywhere, so why not have it neutralized on the scale of hundreds of years instead of thousands?  What possible argument is there against this?  Even if renewables are cheaper, we should still develop nuclear further to clear out the current waste.  And of course still advance fusion.  Long term, I do not just want civilization to rely on renewables for solar exploration.  What if we wanted a Mars base or a base farther out where solar was less salient?

I am \[unwillingly\] one of them. 38 km (the distance to my work) is too far to walk or cycle, and working shift eliminates public transit as an option (my return trip after ending at 10:30 pm would take over 7 hours).

Before I changed my workplace, I rideshared with a colleague. Now I don't, and despite searching among colleagues and contacts I can't find a suitable person to share my ride. Searching the internet and appstore showed promising solutions, none of which helped me find a match.

Not to be deterred, I looked into the matter to see if I could solve my own problem. I listed the major hinderances I and other commuters have regarding ridesharing: not finding a match, fear of strangers, risk of getting stranded at work, uncomfortable discussions about cost-sharing, etc. Then I put my brain into high gear and found believable solutions to all of them. What I came up with was a non-profit organisation which will have a website (geared toward employers and community partners) along with apps (android and IOS) for people wanting to rideshare.

My next step was to start learning java programming, which proved impractical. Ridesharing needs a solution now, not in 3-5 years when I've learned enough to do what I need.

That brings me to the present. I am looking for people with programming experience to both donate advice and programing expertise in order to execute my plan -- to build an app-based network of ridesharers which really delivers an alternative to driving alone to work.

Benefits of Automatic Weather Station for Road Safety,"## Weather Accidents

**A study by Indian Environmental Portal reported that out of total road accidents that occurred in India in the year 2017, 16% was due to poor weather conditions. That means out of 464, 910 accidents that happened in that year, almost 74,070 could have been prevented if the drivers were informed about the weather/road conditions.**

**Safety of transportation is closely related to weather. With the rapid development of transport, accidents are more frequent now.**   


&gt; ***“Since 2000, while the road network in the country has grown by 39%, the number of registered vehicles has grown by about 158%. While growth in road networks will be limited (due to physical constraints),*** [a constant increase in the number of vehicles on roads may lead to congestion and road fatalities.](https://www.prsindia.org/policy/vital-stats/overview-road-accidents-india)***”***

**Aside from the lack of traffic safety, Meteorological influence is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents.**  


**These are weather accidents.** 

***“A weather accident is an accident that occurs in any adverse conditions such as sleet, snow, rain, fog, wind or on slick pavement.”***  


**More accidents occur when the roads are wet following a rainstorm than in any other type of bad weather. Here’s a list of some of the bad road or weather conditions which can lead to accidents:**

### Strong Winds and Hail

**Strong winds, hail, and other such strong convective weather have a more significant impact on traffic. The wind area is proportional to the square of the wind speed. So, when the wind hits the body-wide side, the force is the largest. The wind can cause severe damage to buildings, traffic facilities, and so on. When the wind overturns the motor vehicle, the ability of the car to drive is weakened. The situation worsens if the wind is accompanied by rain.**

### Snow and Ice

**Frost and snow on the road due to extremely low temperatures directly affect the contact of vehicles with the road surface. Ice/snow/frost on the road severely reduces the friction coefficient of the road, so when the driver applies the brake, the tyre surface loses contact with the road surface and the vehicle skids.**

### Low Road visibility

**Dicey weather conditions like mist, fog, snow, heavy rain, or too bright sunlight may affect the driver’s visibility on the road. Road visibility impacts traffic safety, especially on highway traffic safety. The poor road visibility often leads to highway congestion which can interrupt traffic and transportation, even blocking the whole route. According to statistics, traffic accidents caused by the influence of dense fog on the expressway account for about 1/4 of the total number of accidents. In 2018, 18 vehicles collided in a chain due to extreme fog on Yamuna Expressway, killing one.**

### Heavy Rain

**In rainy weather, the ground is slippery, and the visibility is also impacted. Many times, the road fills with rainwater. These factors can lead to route closure. This causes a huge safety hazard to traffic.**

### Extremely High Temperatures

**During summertime, the ground surface temperature can reach up to 40-45 °C in India. Such high temperatures can heat the tyres, and in certain situations, the tyres may flatten down or burst up. This causes the driver to lose control of the vehicle and result in an accident.**  


**Poor weather is a natural phenomenon that we cannot avoid. What can be done as a preventive response, is to alert people on the roads about the extreme or worsening weather conditions. But how can the drivers be warned of real-time weather and road conditions?**

### Welcome Automatic Weather Station (AWS)

&gt;***“The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) as a meteorological station at which observations are made and transmitted automatically (WMO, 1992a).”***  


**An Automatic Weather Station (AWS) is a facility that transmits and records the observations collected from different meteorological measuring instruments. These AWS can collect data from the location, which can then be processed and analyzed locally at the AWS or the central server of the network.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e2za53v3g2y31.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5034195bbba35396f45e6ea05ba728f79a2f9b

**An AWS is a unique and highly comprehensive system strategically located alongside the highways to provide detailed information about the weather and the road conditions. It has robust hardware equipment for data acquisition and cutting-edge software for weather data analytics, providing inputs for the forecasting models.** 

### How does an Automatic Weather Station Work?

* **The AWS consists of several parts:**
* **Data Logger – to record data**
* **Sensors – to measure required parameters**
* **Meteorological Mast – the pole to mount the AWS**
* **Other Accessories**

**The main objective of an** [**Online Weather Monitoring System**](https://oizom.com/product/weathercom-automatic-weather-station/) **dedicated to road safety is to continuously analyze the climatic and road conditions to contribute to Traffic Management System and accident reduction and prevention. For this, the system design takes full consideration of all the local climate characteristics and meteorological requirements. The software architecture uses C/S and B/S, GIS (Geographic Information System) to build an early warning system.**  


**AWS are data collection nodes of both weather and road conditions. Once data is collected, it is transmitted via cloud to the central server where it is processed through robust analytics systems and rendered into useful visualizations.**

**So, let’s see how an AWS can help in** [**reducing Vehicular Pollution Exposure &amp; Road Accidents:**](https://oizom.com/usecase/road-safety-outdoor-air-quality-monitor/)

#### Weather and Road Monitoring

**First things first, an AWS collects all prime weather parameters like air temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, road visibility, road surface temperature, road conditions (ice, snow, wet, dry), freezing point, rainfall, flood, light intensity, and UV radiation.**   


**Monitoring and measuring these parameters can help in assessing the driving situations round the year. Consequently, the data can be used to create data inventory and archival for setting driving limits for every season. AWS improves the timeliness of maintenance and its efficiency, along with minimizing the travellers’ exposure to dangerous weather and roadway conditions.**

#### Notifications and Alerts to Drivers

**AWS data can be transmitted to the drivers via the cloud as alerts or notifications. The AWS can be integrated either on the driver’s phone or car display to push timely notifications. These data can also be published on roadside displays for public dissemination of data. Data can help in arriving at a threshold limit using suitable algorithms.** 

**For example, based on the data, the system can recommend a speed limit to the drivers in highly windy situations. At high speed, the chances of accidents increase as the wind can easily knock down the vehicle. By alerting the driver to reduce his speed, the accident probability is mitigated, as the driver can easily control the car. The system data can also facilitate the users in multiple ways such as sending notification about the air pollution data caused by the vehicle.**

#### ITMS Integration

**Weather stations can be integrated into an existing ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System), which can help in monitoring the traffic pattern of the region. Using the data, the authorities can layout and implement an efficient traffic management system to bring down vehicle emission and ambient pollution levels.**

#### Future Prediction and Forecast

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t5bucvz7g2y31.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd51045202b1a0da31952350800dc3c1b24b32e7

**Weather forecasting and prediction are possible through historical data and trend analysis, which can aid in timely warning/alert broadcasting. The patterns and trends can help in identifying incoming hazards, such as cyclones, hurricanes, floods, drought, etc., especially in hazard-prone areas. Weather forecast can help in the preventive treatment of roads for ice/snow formation or providing early warning on possible fog formation. Early climatic assessment can save significant loss, both financial and human life.**

### Advantages of Automatic Weather Stations

#### Real-Time Data Propagation

**AWS can propagate hyper-local meteorological parameters to the travellers and authorities in real-time, which can help to make on-time decisions in case of any natural hazard. The actual values of the parameters can be provided every 2-30 minutes for continuous and up-to-date data for road safety.**

#### Intelligent Data Communication

**The AWS uses an intelligent communication server. It can utilize GPRS, GSM, WiFi, Ethernet, LoRA, NB-IoT, Sigfox, LTE, Modbus, and many such communication protocols for data transmission. Its low power consumption, long-range data communication enables monitoring even in remote areas. It has the characteristics of high integration, strong function, and strong anti-interference ability.**

#### Solar-powered Functioning

**Automatic Weather stations can run on solar power, meaning it does not consume significant energy while preventing accidents. This feature greatly reduces the damage caused by the induced current caused by lightning to the acquisition system and the sensor.**

#### Low Maintenance

**Robust and weatherproof design enables an AWS to function even at extreme hot, cold, windy, dusty conditions. Though the sensors require periodic calibration, the overall maintenance is quite cost-effective.**

**Hence, the combined system of road video surveillance, traffic flow monitoring, and automatic weather station information will form a “smart transportation network.”**  


**Automatic weather stations can also be integrated as a part of other environment or pollution measuring devices in combination with the data-acquisition and processing units. Such a combined system of equipment, interfaces, and processing units is called an Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) or Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).**

### What’s the Future for Road Safety Like?

**Government departments can use AWS information. It will help them take appropriate action in case of low visibility and fog. They can warn drivers about fog conditions to prevent road accidents.**  


**The future roads will generate an unparalleled amount of hyperlocal weather and road data which can be used to prepare a model for the best and safest road systems. The fatal road accidents can be prevented from occurring using road data and its trends. Real-time data can help in assessing where and how traffic congestion and accidents happen, allowing the authorities to manage them accordingly. Vehicle manufacturers will also be able to use the data in designing safer vehicles that can communicate with the roads and other cars.**

Proposal: International Don't Google Anything Day,"TL;DR - Don't search for anything, save a lot of energy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**International Don't Google Anything Day!**

So, I was trying to work out what could potentially be done to help continue to raise awareness of both our energy use (and demands) and the impact they're having on the environment, I was Googling a few bits and pieces and wondered how much power it took to run a Google search.

There isn't recent data, but the last available data (from 2009) placed this at 0.3Wh or enough to run a 10 Watt bulb for 108 seconds - on modern terms, that is a 5w (50w equivalent) LED bulb for **216 seconds**. 

Google offsets its energy use with a purchase of the equivalent amount of renewable energy to achieve 'net zero operational emissions' but that doesn't address the question of Energy Need and the amount of 'home power' required to make these searches.

So what, if for one day...maybe a Sunday when people aren't at their desks, we all just didn't Google/Bing/whatever anything for a day (Ecosia plants trees for their searches so maybe they get dispensation)? 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of internet users (c. 3.05bn) in the world,  hitting even a fraction of them would result in considerable energy savings: 

If 1 million people worldwide decided to not google anything **ONCE**, the power saved would be more than **8 years** **constant** use of a room-lighting LED bulb. For argument's sake, let's say a bulb is used on average 4 hours a day, in real terms it means that bulb could run for 48 years. 

All that from **one** less search.",environment,1573644279,BusyMinimum,2,1,True,2019-11-13 06:24:39

Pros and Cons of [Outsourcing Mobile App Development](https://www.cypressoft.com/post/outsource-mobile-application-development)

**1. Mobile App Outsourcing is Cost-effective**

As it is said, outsourcing is money saving. Reasonable cost is one of the most critical factors and advantages of hiring an offshore application development team. Currently, businesses can easily find professionals at an effective cost, who can support in providing a high-quality IT product. Outsourcing reduces the total development costs, and in such cases, it’s possible to save money on atop costs and spend lower prices on offshore labor.

On the other hand, if you have an in-house team, you offer a monthly salary regardless of the workload. However, outsourcing gives an opportunity to hire a team for a single project. 

**2. Time-saving**

Being first in the market may greatly influence the competition. When offshore companies work 24/7 to deliver the software product within the deadlines set in advance, the development process takes less time. 

**3. Additional Experience**

Very often, an in-house team may lack the specific knowledge and experience to deliver the required solutions, and as a business, you have to spend time looking for additional talents who should be trained to suit your project needs. The mobile application outsourcing brings extra experience and knowledge to achieve business objectives.

**4. Wide Choice of New Talents**

While outsourcing development, businesses deal with a larger market for IT companies. They have a wide choice to select the best app development company in the extensive pool of talents. As a result, there is an advantage to choose the company experienced in your business field.

You may learn about the experience sphere of the company by checking their portfolio. There you get familiar with the various business solutions the agency has provided in different industries.

**5. Business Value**

The companies that rely on outsourcing have staff overloaded with work. The outsourcing services can help to take care of the overall programming processes and highlight the main functions. An offshore agency takes all the hard work of development, and you save time to focus on other higher tasks, including marketing, demands, content, and other additional services. Outsourcing helps you get more free time, and you can take into consideration other essential functions and be more active in other areas of business scope.",environment,1573649084,TraditionalAsk1,0,1,True,2019-11-13 07:44:44

NORD STREAM 2 POSES RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER THROUGH CHEMICAL MUNITIONS IN BALTIC SEA," 

https://preview.redd.it/je2xt5uwivw31.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d817b73a70c95ca5cb7d66268db85617bf5ff70b

Recently the Danish authorities have finally agreed the construction of the part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. It should run along the country’s continental shelf southeast of Bornholm on the bed of the Baltic Sea.

However, this decision may become fateful for the whole ecosystem through its irreversible environmental impact. Basically, the case is not the Nord Stream 2 itself, but the chemical munitions on the seabed along the pipe route, which may make it impossible to use the water area for fishing and recreational services.

This threat has not become a surprise for Russia which for a decade sought ways to circumvent the chemical munitions dumping sites east of Bornholm. However, the lack of verifiable information about the precise sites of chemical deposits made these attempts futile.

Hazardous waste on the seabottom includes adamsite, diphenylchloroarsine, and mustard gas, which appeared there back in Soviet times, when they were dumped in cases by ships on their way to designated area. The sea drift carried them far beyond this area which resulted in munition cases found in unexpected locations not only on the Bornholm coasts but even in Sweden. Still the location of the entire arsenal in the Baltic Sea remains unknown.

Official documents of that time stated that in 1946, four ships carrying 15.000 tonnes of dangerous cargo were sunk nearby the Bornholm coast along with 8 tonnes of chemicals dumped to the east of the island. Their dumping was complicated with the poor visibility and weather conditions which meant the chemical agents were dropped outside the designated areas.

Another source of pollution was 69.000 tonnes of shells with tabun (nerve gas) and phosgene which appeared in water of the so-called Small Belt near Bornholm after the Wermacht\\u2019s decision to dump it in 1945. The new episode of contamination was provoked by development in chemical weapons, turning them from mustard-based to those containing sarin. As a result, out of date munitions were dumped in Baltic, Kara, Okhotsk, and Barents Seas without clear indication of pollution areas.

According to the report of the Special Working Commission on Chemical Weapons Utilization of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM CHEMU) of 1994, all the attempts to take chemical weapons from the seabed are not only feasible but even dangerous and therefore unacceptable. Another document, The 2009 Nord Stream Espoo Report: Key Issue Paper Munitions: Conventional and Chemical states that the only way to dispose of the dangerous residue on the seabed is their explosion, however, the risk of contamination of far wider areas is too high as well as the threat of the rise of toxic substances into the surface layers of the sea with subsequent pollution and harm to marine organisms seems inevitable.

Moreover, that is the construction of the Nord Stream 2 that may result in violation of integrity or even detonation of the munitions, making the worst scenario possible. Though even successful construction of the Nord Stream 2 does not guarantee the further safety of its operation since vibration may cause unpredictable consequences if the pipe lies over dumping locations. By the way, the one or two molecules of mustard gas only may result in pronounces mental and physical deviations for the affected organism.

The Jellyfish Nightmare,"In the summer of 2014, the central east coast of Florida (Space Coast &amp; Treasure Coast) experienced a persistent influx of jellyfish. As the ocean temperatures rose throughout the summer months so did the jellyfish population. As a surfer, I spend hours a day in the ocean and have been stung countless times. I would come up with theories about tidal changes and phases of the moon dictating the movement of jellyfish, but nothing really made sense.

Along with the moon jellies, the translucent tiny particles were the biggest nuisance. These particles were apparently either jelly fish larvae (sea lice) or broken up pieces of a jellyfish from rough seas. There seems to be no connection to when these random jelly blooms happen but dead zones are popping up everywhere around the world. With a continuous flow of fertilizers and other contaminants entering the ocean, it is inevitable the jellyfish will keep coming. With only two predators (turtles &amp; whales) in the ocean, there seems to be no hope for a decline in jellyfish population.

"Coffee Pilot | Carbon Asset NA Inc - Carbon Offsets of 18 tonnes in Coffee pilot in Halifax , Nova Scotia","I came across this project when looking for some research on carbon neutrality and it seems a interesting concept and some thing that might gain traction and bring more awareness to people.

I have seen carbon projects before that struggled due to the legacy issues with the carbon sector , but this looks like it has addressed some of those by use of blockchain and auditability.

Wondering if anyone has seen similar ideas elsewhere (I know Australia is very active in carbon) and do people think this kind of project can get momentum and make a difference as people become more aware of their possible carbon footprint.

I think this is a bit of a gamification which I see as a good way of getting awareness and any positive news is good for the environment and even better if big chains follow  similar concepts .

The Dirty Air In Phoenix Arizona," 

The air might kill us! I said the air we breath may kill us. The other day I was driving home from work on the I- 10 I saw my city buildings swimming in smoke. The city was covered in a brown cloud of smoke. I felt a very bad feeling. We have very air quality. We might die of lung disease because the air we breath is killing us. My car is a hybrid, I wanted to save money on gas therefore I picked a gas saver. I’ve seen lots of trucks smoking. The air quality is terrible here in Phoenix AZ. The rent is cheap and there are lots of jobs for college students and recent graduates to just grab in the fastest developing city in the United States. How can we better the quality of air? We need clean air laws. With mexico being out neighbor we can not dirty their air. The companies smoking the tall tubes are burning and the smoke is killing us. This is third degree murder in my eyes. I came to this state to study. Unfortunately the companies that make billions do it at our expense. During the summer, it gets really hot making it hard to breath in 107 degrees Fahrenheit weather. The Weather Channel sends out warning of bad air quality. This is not climate change. We need new people in power that can change our laws so we can have clean air. New laws may clean up the air, but it's up to every resident in Arizona to propose and sign a new law that cleans up the air.

The dirty garbage cans, the dog poop, the dirty water and the flies that walk on you if they think you smell nice. I don’t like flies on me. We need to clean up our area. I want a clean place to live. We need new laws or else we are paying for out own early death. We need a new law to change the air here in Phoenix A.Z.

Produce growers pump CO2 into sealed glasshouses at rates up to 2000ppm, as it accelerates plant growth and reduces water demand. So it's obvious CO2 is a life-giving gas, not a poison.

This is the Fifth Sign: The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider’s web.

This is the Sixth sign: The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun.

This is the Seventh Sign: You will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it.

This is the Eight Sign: You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom. 

And this is the Ninth and Last Sign: You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease. 

These are the Signs that great destruction is coming. The world shall rock to and fro.

You aren’t trying to litter… but you aren't trying to prevent it either.  

Littering is a **worldwide** epidemic. 

It affects us as humans, the animals we share our planet with, the air we breathe, the water we consume, the soil we depend on for food, and **SO** much more.   

We only have *one* planet Earth.  

Little do you know that our *one* planet will no longer be [inhabitable after 100 years](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html) if our rate of littering does not decrease substantially.

Little do you know…  

Little do you know…  

Little do you know.  

It only takes *one* plan of action to combat the negative effects of litter; dispose of trash responsibly.  

Putting a trash bag in your car, deliberately placing trash into the garbage, and corralling loose garbage will reduce accidental littering. Reduce your waste in general by collecting recyclables each week, or giving trash a new use by reusing, or putting your money into products that create little to no waste.

It’s never okay to litter. Not intentionally. Not “accidentally.”

The Hefty Energy Bag Program - Environmentally good or bad?,"I am part of the very first Canadian pilot program of the 'Hefty Energy Bag' program, in London Ontario. Similar programs have been running for a few years in a very select number of US cities. This has been advertised as 'an easy way to divert unrecyclable plastics from landfills and convert them into energy'. 

I have found very little on this program. Basically, our household received a roll of special orange bags, which we are supposed to put all of our non-recyclable plastics in, such as food containers, meat and vegetable packaging, any kind of small food wrapper, and really any other kind of plastic that you would normally put in the garbage. Sounds great, right? Here is a link to the [Hefty Energy Bag Program](https://www.hefty.com/hefty-energybag/hefty-energybag-program).

Well unfortunately, this program is backed by some pretty big evil names like DOW Chemical and Nestle. The program got an initial bad rap in Omaha because they were burning the plastic in a cement kiln to power the kiln. [Omaha now says the majority of it's plastic is sent to pyrolysis facilities around the country](https://www.keepomahabeautiful.org/resources/heft-energy-bag.html), which appears to be a process to turn plastic into useable fossil fuels again. I do not know enough about this process to know if it's a new good or bad for the environment.

I have e-mailed my city with many questions to try and get more details. At this point I have no idea what happens to the bags after I fill them and drop them off at my local 'envirodepot'. Does anyone know any more about this process and whether or not it's something I would want to participate in? 

On one hand, keeping plastic out of landfills sounds great, but on the other, it seems to encourage the continued production of disposable plastic and fossil fuel burning.

I've got this bag, and I can't undo that. But if I dispose of it, I'm doing two things:

1) waste paper because paper bags are less durable and require constant buying/changing
2) encourage production of more plastic because at some point, somebody in some store is going to give it to me regardless

Rather than harm more trees and end up getting more plastic, wouldn't it be more logical for me to use the plastic bags I have for as long as possible? They're far more durable and I'd be doing a lot of favors. Since I've got plastic already, I might as well use it and not waste something else in that duration because whether I get rid of it or not, it's here now anyway.

Fire Drill Friday 11/1,"*A thousand apologies if this isn’t the appropriate place for this, but I figure the nature of this sub might afford me a solid chance at the following reaching the right audience:*

Has anyone here attended any of Jane Fonda &amp; Company’s demonstrations this past month? I’m slightly critical of her motives, but I’m planning to attend her protest with Lily Tomlin at the Capitol this morning, as I’d like to witness the event firsthand, seeing as the press is only interested in covering arrests.

I submit this inquiry in attempt to gauge how long her rallies generally last. I know they commence at 11a, but the way things are going, I won’t be arriving to the parking garage (only a block South of the Mall) until 11;10a (I’m traveling up from East Tennessee for the weekend as I write). I know 10-15 minutes doesn’t seem like much of a loss, but from what we’re getting from the media, it seems like they just show up, get arrested, and that’s it, which shouldn’t take much time, at all. I’ve a spot reserved for 2 hours, though.

Do they generally start at 11:00a on-the-dot?
Do they set aside time for speakers?
Will 2 hours be enough? Will it be too much?

**Also**, I’m traveling with my dog (very tame and friendly, so I’m not really concerned about his demeanor or whether or not he’ll disturb anyone), and I’m not, at all, interested in being arrested and risking his (and my) sanity by having him taken to the pound — plus, he will give any Animal Control officer absolute Hell if he suspects I’m in even the slightest of danger. I understand Fonda &amp; Co. are arrested on grounds of blocking the Capitol entrance — will we be safe on the lawn across the drive from the steps, or should we stay on the west side of First St NW in front of the Grant Memorial?

I’d really like to see my suspicions regarding Jane’s intentions proven wrong, and I’d like to do so as safely, legally, and efficiently as possible. Any heads up, advice, or insight will be appreciated beyond belief. And, let me know if you’re going to be there today! I tend to spend my time solely with [Milo](https://imgur.com/a/WCqImQO) when I’m in the city, but I’d love to meet some fellow Redditors fighting to address climate change this morning!

**When: Tuesday, November 12, 3pm ET**

A new report released by CXC offers a carbon pricing policy framework that contextualizes the potential role it can play in a just transition to a regenerative, sustainable, and equitable economy. If carbon pricing is to be a central component of climate policy moving forward, it must not only reduce GHG emissions, but also embrace deep overlapping connections with major social and environmental justice issues of our time.

So how exactly can carbon pricing programs improve public health, sustainable development, economic mobility, resilience, and political self-determination in the communities that need it most?

Hear from Veronica Eady of California’s Air Resources Board (CARB), Eleanor Fort of Green for All, as well as lead author Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange on his report and what we can learn from California’s experience on cap-and-trade and environmental justice.

Isn´t planting 20 Million Trees actually just a wasted effort?,"Hi there!

I know that im propably running a high risk of just getting downvoted to hell instantly and I just want to say beforehand that I don´t want to shit on mrbeast and I do think that his intentions are honourable, but I geniuenly wonder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we all heard about this Viral Sensation, the Youtuber mrbeast planting (or well collecting donations to plant) 20 Million Trees.

My first Reaction was : wow mindblowing. What a fucking Behemoth of a task for one Person, he really makes a difference this is so great. Celebreties joining in, everyone seems to actually make an effort to do something good for the planet. 20,000,000 Trees - thats insane. 

I found that to be so exciting , anyone could do a part by just donating 5 or 10 or 20 Bucks and leaving a comment in this huge thing.

And I saw the comments: ""Lets keep our kind alive"" ""I want my grandchildren to see this planet"", even countires (legit or not) commenting lol.

Then I couldnt help but thinking to myself : can 20 million dollars really make that much of a difference? How many trees are there actually, how many are planted every year, how many are cut down each day?

I figured it was some huge number, propably a couple hundred billion ""or so"", but I wouldnt have guessed that its over 3 trillion. There are over 3,000,000,000,000,000 trees in the world - thats a number no one can grasp and there are a couple hundred thousand cut down every day only for toilet paper and tissues - there are propably a couple hundred thousand planted every day, even if thats only for cutting them down again eventually in some kind of  agricultural culture etc. to make it short: the numbers and proportions when it comes to trees are just insane. 20,000,000 trees arent even any kind of splash to that - thats barely any kind of expressable percentage.

Now if I think about how overwhelmingly positive people are towards this charity, and how I was , and what kind of speculative impact is behind these comments, I cant help but to now think that this is actually unfortunately kind of stupid and if anything, although with no evil intent whatsoever, eyewashing ourselves, donating 5 bucks for 5 trees and feeling good about doing nothing of any actual meaning.

Again, repeating, no hate, but if you have anything to say about this other than ""wow super cool"" you instantly get booed and I just feel like people should rather inform themselves about trees than donate 5 bucks and thinking they did something great - wont it just be a big waste of 20 million dollars in the end?

Idk whats you environmentalists take on this, am I missing something, will this geniuenly have any impact at all? Im curious",environment,1572651524,stevengaetchen,14,1,True,2019-11-01 19:38:44
Could commuting to work become regulated because of environments concerns?,"As we start to look more closely at extremes of human behavior that have gotten out of hand, ridiculously long commutes seem like something that could be looked at. I’ve heard of companies in one city with commuters coming from another city that also has another location of the same company, with certain people from that city commuting to the other one.

Working from home is certainly an ideal and has gained so much ground; of course, not all jobs are suitable for this. 

Could certain penalties apply to companies who hire people who live a long distance away? You could argue that this would penalize people who might not be able to afford to live closer.  This might then set the stage to make integrated housing more of a priority for the sake of the environment.

A secondary argument might be to find ways for people to have more resources to be able to find suitable employment closer to home, or to become self-employed if that wasn’t a viable option.

I am not.

Last night I decided to browse a lively discussion that their /b/ board regarding everyone's favourite topic: Climate change. And boy, what a discussion it was. From the intentional spreading of misinformation and bad-faith debates to endlessly-parroted talking points to scary levels of malicious apathy. 

While reading all this, I realized something. There are real people behind all these posts. These people are among us. They _are_ us. Friends, family, coworkers. These people vote. These people make purchases. These people spread their opinions elsewhere. On an anonymous board, people are more likely to share their terrible idiotic opinions without a care in the world. These opinions are, terrifyingly, more common than we'd like to think.

Reading this thread has sort of broken me. I'm honestly fully convinced after reading this that we are doomed.

The Last Bee,"&amp;#x200B;

Once upon a time…*in a world now dead, gone and forgotten*…there  was a Bee. And one bright and sunny day this particular Bee was flying  from flower to flower, collecting pollen, exactly as the Universe, in  its infinite wisdom, had planned for Bees to do. Nothing unusual in this  scenario, no?

No.

*Except that this Bee was the last Bee on the planet.*

And as the Bee flew from flower to flower it  collected not just pollen but also a little bit of pesticide here, a  little bit of herbicide there and God knows what other toxic,  life-destroying chemicals.

Soon, the Bee sickened and weakened, its immune  system destroyed, like all the Bees before it, by a Hell’s Brew of  poisonous products produced (at huge profit, it has to be admitted) by  Big Agro and Big Pharma in their psychopathic pursuit of profit, profit  and more profit and damn the consequences.

The Bee fell to the ground. Walked in a circle,  dazed, confused and unknowing of the evil and greed of men. It stopped,  rolled over, kicked its legs feebly. And died.

And thus it was that the last Bee left this world, and that the Beauty of Bees was stolen from the Universe for ever.

Witnessing the death of the last Bee, plants across the world cried, for they knew that without bees they, too, would soon die.

Upon seeing the plants cry, the insects cried for they knew that without plants, they too would soon die.

Upon seeing the insects cry, the birds cried for they knew that without insects, they too would soon die.

Upon seeing the birds cry, the animals cried for they knew that without birds, they too would soon die.

And then the fish cried, and the Oceans and the  Mountains and the Clouds and the Stars in the sky and even the Universe  itself cried and the sound they all made together was a sad,  bittersweet, utterly heart breaking requiem for a world that would soon  no longer be, for the loss of all that had been and all that could have  been.

There was, however, one creature upon the face of the  world that did not cry. Humanity. For humanity was too stupid to  realise that it, too, was now on a fast-track, one way road to  extinction. It was far too busy to think about a dying bee; too absorbed  in iDiotphones and FakeBook and Unsocial Media and Moronical Super  Heroes and Zombies and the farcical, money-driven pantomime that is  politics and Bling and Celebrity and the smooth, glib lies of the  Talking Head on the TV as it read out the ‘news’.

How can carbon pricing further environmental justice?,"**Register for the webinar here:** [**https://climate-xchange.org/event/how-carbon-pricing-can-further-environmental-justice/**](https://climate-xchange.org/event/how-carbon-pricing-can-further-environmental-justice/)

**When: Tuesday, November 12, 3pm ET**

A new report released by Climate XChange offers a carbon pricing policy framework that contextualizes the potential role it can play in a just transition to a regenerative, sustainable, and equitable economy. If carbon pricing is to be a central component of climate policy moving forward, it must not only reduce GHG emissions, but also embrace deep overlapping connections with major social and environmental justice issues of our time.

So how exactly can carbon pricing programs improve public health, sustainable development, economic mobility, resilience, and political self-determination in the communities that need it most?

Hear from Veronica Eady of California’s Air Resources Board (CARB), Eleanor Fort of Green for All, as well as lead author Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange on his report and what we can learn from California’s experience on cap-and-trade and environmental justice.

They're also a nutritional powerhouse. They're high in protein and are a complete protein, meaning they have all essential amino acids.

Some have even called them delicious, as they have a bit of an earthy, or nutty flavor mixed with a savory flavor that's vaguely meat-like.

Poem I wrote about global warming,"When I grow up
I want to be able to walk through a forest 
that hasn't been burned
and cut to the ground,
To be able to hear the birds sing
that haven't been hunted to extinction.
When I grow up, 
I don't want to have to use a mask to breathe, 
like the masks our so called “leaders” tell lies through.
When I grow up, 
I don't want to choke on carbon and excuses,
I don’t want our ice to melt quicker
than our dreams of living in a clean world.
When I grow up, 
I hope that everyone can be as strong as a 16-year-old girl.
When I grow up,
 I don’t want to leave the world’s problems for the next generation, 
I want to fix them for every generation. 
When I grow up,
I want to live in the world the way 
Mother Nature intended it to be.

"Evaporation farms, an open-source/idea project","I would like to share an idea and hope to have a constructive brainstorming session. Global warming poses a great threat for humanity and it is predicted that it might have huge impact on drinkable freshwater resources. My proposal to adress this issue is to increase the water cycle in an energy-neural way using ""evaporation farms"". The idea is to increase the natural evaporation rate on the sea surface dramatically that would result in more clouds and thus, more rainfall on the land. I think this would also help global warming in two ways: (i) more clouds will reflect the sunlight with the high ""albedo"" effect like in the poles, (ii) and the heat of the sunlight will be captured by the natural evaporation while trapping the heat at ocean/sea surface.

So, how can we achieve this? I am sure there are many creative ways to do this, and I will be happy to hear your ideas. Here, my suggestion is a floating isolation surface that will enclose a thin layer of water from the rest of the sea. You can see a simplistic sketch trying to explain what I mean. The energy from the sunlight will improve the evaporation rate locally in this pool. Ideally, this will be a completely passive process with no energy requirement except sunlight (excluding production costs). With directed pores, we can replace the evaporated water with continuous flow driven by local currents in the sea. As the energy will be redirected to evaporation, the deeper layers of the sea/ocean will not warm up as without the isolated layer of evaporation farm. Similar to desalination, salt/evaporite might accumulate and to avoid this, the buoyancy might be adjusted during the day to wash off the salt. Of course, there are many challenges in scaling up this project. The initial cost should be minimum so we can cover a larger area of sea surface near the coasts. It is hard for me to judge whether technological solutions would be scalable enough to impact the overall evaporation rates both locally and globally. Any idea if you think this would work at all and why not?

The Oil And Gas Industry In Canada: Is A Compromise Possible?,"It has been a problem for a while now in Canada. As a country whose economy is largely dependent on the oil and gas industry, the exhausting debate over whether Canada should continue to invest in the oilsands and in energy pipelines is still ongoing. While I definitely agree that climate change is one of the world's most critical issues, I too feel that it would be unfair to neglect the legitimate concerns of those working in the oil and gas industry. 

Now I am not talking about those oil and gas CEOs who would be totally O.K. with turning Alberta into one large, toxic oil pit if it meant more dollars filled their pockets. However, there are those that depend on it for a living and those that are worried about themselves and their family, and what the future holds for them. That was particularly evident from the wave of blue (voting Conservative) across the prairies in the recent election. The unfortunate truth is that we cannot get rid of oil overnight. What also cannot happen overnight is Alberta moving its economic focus from almost solely oil and gas into other industries.

Therefore, I was wondering what others were thinking about a possible compromise between the two sides. Is it possible to strike a balance between the economic interests of oil and gas advocates (or perhaps, people who just want a job at the end of the day) with the  environmental interests of climate change activists? If so, how could this be done? If and when we begin shifting away slowly from oil (which should be right now), what is the most practical and reasonable way to go about doing this?

Planting local species of trees instead of using headstones in cemeteries makes more sense.,"[petition of change ](http://chng.it/TzQgqwJn) How much better would it be to drive by a cemetery in a crowded city or a rural town and see a place thriving with nature instead of sad headstones covering an empty space? Not only would this help with the environment but it would not bring property value down living next to a cemetery. I know if I were to die I would rather my body go to the earth and something come from me instead of my entire life be represented by a cold piece of stone.

#TeamTrees is Sweeping YouTube! and What if ECOSIA + Others Joined?,"People from all around the world have asked and now tons of people are all joining on 20 MILLION Tree challenge!! Suggested to YouTube, philanthropist, MR. BEAST and now since uploading his video on the 25th of October has raised millions in donations (around 8 million at the time of this post)! He and some other YouTubers then teamed up to form TeamTree with the Arbor Day Foundation to help plant more trees.

Team Trees website: [https://teamtrees.org/](https://teamtrees.org/)  


So many people are joining the effort and that the #TeamTrees collaboration is trending so much, I wondered how to take it further and get more people involved. Obviously you can help by spreading the word, sharing your opinion and taking action (Go plant \~\~A\~\~ some trees for example)! Any little bit counts and doing more is great, don't limit yourself and you may be surprised how much you can do. This effort needs more hands and more groups connected to it.  


I use this search engine called \*\*Ecosia\*\* which basically turns your searches into trees! What's easier than donating than looking up stuff on the internet like we already use Google and stuff for? They have already planted over \*\*70 MILLION Trees\*\* with their UK-based website through ad revenue generated from user searches. I would LOVE to see Ecosia connect with TeamTrees to help plant trees wherever needed.

State Run Waste Mangement,"So I've had this idea for quite a while. Im currently taking a year off from college to travel so I haven't really had a chance to discuss it with anyone, so I'm curious on what you guys would think. As you may know, the world has a waste management problem, especially in the US where it seems that the way the companies are managing our waste is not very effective. I'm quite curious if the aspect of WM in the US being a business is infringing on us really solving our issue of really getting rid of the waste that is really screwing up our cities, the environment, and our health. The ways that we are dealing with them now include landfills, incineration, dumping it in the ocean, and sending it off to less developed countries to deal with it. With a country as rich as the US, I believe we really could be handling our WM alot more effectively and sustainably. I speculate if we depend on private companies to clean up our oceans and deal with our millions of tons of waste, it will never get done. Call me naive for putting my eggs in the basket of government, but with the amount of money we waste on our military, we really could be doing wonders on cleaning up our oceans and dealing with waste. So this is what I propose. Imagine if a govt agency was created just for cleaning up trash and disposing it (of course in a far more sophisticated way than just landfills which is quite barbaric because eventually were gonna run out of space like in WALL E). With all the trash in the ocean, it would create tons of jobs! If the govt were to invest more in to research of WM I'm sure we could solve the problem in far more efficient and green way. The one thing that I think could be used is plasma gasification. I know the argument is that its expensive and doesn't create that much energy. But the thing is the amount of plasma gasification plants around the world is kind of small and they're funded by private companies. And I'm pretty sure the US govt could afford it if they wanted to. But in conclusion I believe the incentive of profiting off of trash will shoot our foot in the long run. We should be aiming to limit the amount of waste going out and dealing with that waste properly, not worried about the money, but worried about just eliminating it. It's like picking up your dog poop only because you get money out if it. That shouldn't be the case we should clean it up because we have to. So that would technically mean we need to tax companies that are in fact producing 90+% of the waste and holding them accountable.

Any advice for a company with a strong environmental ethos that wishes to consider the environmental impact of the software that they use?,"I am a software consultant hoping to help a new tech team get set up. The company that they are part of has a strong environmental ethos and public image, so they want to ensure that everything that they do makes best efforts to be ethical and sustainable.

They have asked for advice on the best tooling to get set up for a typical office project, while keeping the above considerations in mind. Things like communications tool (e.g. Slack), project management tools (e.g. Trello) and file storage (e.g. Dropbox).

This is not something that I have considered before! My gut feeling is that any of the major tools out there are going to be much of a muchness on this sort of thing, but just in case they are not, I have a few questions:

1. Are there any tools / companies for this sort of project management that can be particularly recommended on the basis of environmental factors?
2. Are there any popular tools / companies that should be *avoided* because of a bad record on environmental issues?

Carbon dioxide in Kansas (plz help for school),"According to Popular Science of Bonnier Corporation there is a big thing they called the best us project that says, “On May 4, 2007, a tornado ripped through central Kansas. When it was over, nearly 95 percent of the small town of Greensburg was destroyed. Turning tragedy into opportunity, the community decided to rebuild itself as a model green town, powered by a mix of geothermal, solar and wind. A few of the city buildings even power themselves with their own wind and solar generators, and a 10-turbine wind farm outside of town went online in March” this is a great thing that happened but we don't all have tornadoes (tornadoes not a good thing but still) to reset so we need to take the initiative to fix out towns that use a lot of Co2 and turn them into greentowns.

Instead of taking a town down we need to switch to renewable energy source or a not so harmful energy source. Witch is nuclear power, many people hate nuclear power and I don’t get that there is nothing wrong with nuclear power. The smoke you see coming out of the top is not smoke its steam from the plant to spin the turbine and it is a very good source of energy. We need more nuclear power plants and less coal plants and a good renewable source so we can stop harming the environment and start helping it.

If we don’t use this solution or any other solution we could destroy this planet, it would destroy the oceans and would increase the temperature of our planet or other known as global warming so all of us should care but most of us don’t, we need everyone to care so we can make a big difference, or this will be the biggest trophic cascade or extinction in history the end of man.

Organic Farming creates MORE greenhouse gasses than trad. farming," [https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-23/organic-vs-non-organic-farming-emissions/11623288](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-23/organic-vs-non-organic-farming-emissions/11623288) 

Organic farming uses less pesticides, fertilisers and herbicides than non-organic practices, and organic-farming advocates also claim it saves water and controls erosion.  But converting the world's agriculture to organic would actually produce far more carbon dioxide emissions, according to a new study. 

In a scenario in which England and Wales hypothetically switched to 100 per cent organic farming practices, researchers found organic methods typically had much lower nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of area farmed, thanks to the use of nitrogen-fixing plants rather than fertilisers.

But the volume of food grown per unit of area farmed organically was 40 per cent less than yields from conventional farming methods, according to the [**research, published in the journal Nature Communications today**](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-23/organic-vs-non-organic-farming-emissions/10.1038/s41467-019-12622-7).

**When: October 28th, 3pm ET**

As of 2017, transportation has become the leading source of greenhouse gas pollution across all US sectors. Meanwhile, Americans suffer from ever-increasing traffic congestion, infrastructural decay, and major deficiencies in how we move people and goods around. The next decade will require bold and rapid solutions to transform the sector, both for the sake of our climate and our daily livelihoods.

The Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI), a regional cap-and-invest program for transportation emissions, has emerged as the most promising new programs to tackle both GHG emissions and transportation woes in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. However, the effectiveness of the program will depend on how it is designed and implemented in the coming year.

What exactly is TCI? What does the program mean for climate and transportation policy in the region? What role can the pivotal relationship between transportation and climate will play in the coming decade to substantially reduce emissions by 2030? How will TCI impact state-level climate policy?

Join Chris Dempsey of Transportation for Massachusetts (T4MA), Jordan Stutt of Acadia Center, and Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange, in answering and discussing these questions with you. We hope you can join us!",environment,1571937122,rubywincele,0,1,True,2019-10-24 13:12:02

How to stop home development?,"I live in Florida. So I am a half marathon runner and I like running in various forests in the county that I live in. Lately there has been an incredible increase in development and 5 out of the 9 forests that I go running in have been clear-cut. There are only a few forests left. They have been coming in, clearing the land, and building new housing developments. I have been emailing the mayors of the cities expressing my concerns and they still don't care. They have everything backwards. One of the city commissioners told me ""This construction is good for the environment since it's close by and people will have to drive less."" Other commissioners told me ""Oh there's already a bunch of homes nearby so we don't care about this forest. It's not important since it's a fragmented ecosystem."" The problem is there's too many people moving here to Florida and these developers come by and pay 50 million dollars for the land. And money talks. So it's 50 million dollars VS the opinion of a bunch of environmentalists like me. I honestly feel like there's no hope. I don't know what to do. It breaks my heart seeing everything I love being destroyed. Honestly it's like cancer. It's been spreading sooo much. Like in places I could NEVER possibly believe. They are literally taking EVERYTHING and only leaving the conservation lands alone.

White People’s Diets Are Killing the Environment: Study," Caucasian populations are disproportionately contributing to climate change through their eating habits, which uses up more food — and emits more greenhouse gases — than the typical diets of black and Latinx communities, according to a new report published in the Journal of [Industrial Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12859).

Researchers tracked information from multiple databases to identify foods considered “environmentally intense” by requiring more precious resources such as water, land and energy to produce — and, as a result, releasing more greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide through production and distribution.

Potatoes, beef, apples and milk are some of the worst offenders.

“The food pipeline — which includes its production, distribution and waste — contributes significantly to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases and requires significant amounts of water and land, which also has environmental effects,” [says Joe Bozeman](https://today.uic.edu/white-peoples-eating-habits-produce-most-greenhouse-gases), a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who helped author the study.

The EPA {snip} data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600.

They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively, than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.

“{snip} it’s very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices,” says Bozeman.

\[Editor’s Note: The study “Overcoming climate change adaptation barriers: A study on food–energy–water impacts of the average American diet by demographic group” is available online [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12859).\]

In a nutshell, they say that if we convert all the agriculture to organic farming.

In addition, organic farming will not be enough efficient at all to feed the whole population so a country like UK will be forced to import food supplies generating even more pollution.

How to harness untapped landfill methane gas,"My father was a genius mechanical engineer for Caterpillar Tractor - Large Engine Division. Some of these engines were over 50ft long, had 48 cylinders, with cylinder heads as big around as your arms. They burn enough natural gas to power a large hospital or even a small city in South America.

He was given a project to hook up the methane vents from the local landfill to a generator. The problem was, R-12 Freon from old refrigerators was leaking into gas supply then breaking down into hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid which required the engine to be rebuilt once a month.

His solution was simple. He raised the water jacket temperature so the freon passed through the combustion chamber unchanged then passed into the exhaust system where it broke down into harmless byproducts. The muffler would need to be changed more often, but this was an acceptable and economical compromise.

Too big trees can either be sold as wind breakers for the many new farms needing evergreens for coffee and chocolate. Or they can be cut for Christmas Trees for larger companies.

We do grow Christmas Trees- the current 'stock' is about 5,000 trees locally sourced. The market is over 200,000 trees more needed per year.

We will have to deliver by truck when needed - or families could pick up on own.

We want to try a subscription model for families to propagate a Sacred Ohi'a Tree as well as ' be the steward for a Christmas Tree. We're making a direct correlation to people buying imported trees caused many of the diseases in Hawaii- including the one that is killing Ohi'a.

You are right that many people prefer 5 year old trees. HI grows some plants more quickly. We are thinking of using both an artificial tree for size and an adopted Christmas Tree as well as an Ohi'a tree for new family traditions.

Trees are sustainable. We believe that our value is preventing the billions of dollars of damage importing diseased dead trees causes Hawaii's fragile ag and ecosystem.",environment,1571279712,beelokahi,0,2,True,2019-10-16 22:35:12

How will ingesting microplastics affect us in the future?,"I was pretty appalled after watching a video on plastic pollution in my ecology class. Its a video by Kurzgesagt which goes into detail about the current state of plastic pollution on Earth today. While not much of it will be surprising to the general public who agree that climate change is real, there is a part of the video that goes into detail about microplastics. Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 mm, some are used in cosmetics and toothpaste but the majority are seen in already existing plastic waste that has been exposed to UV radiation. 51 trillion particles are ingested by marine life; many of which we consume. The concerning part is the lack of knowledge we have about how these plastics we ingest are going to affect us in the long term. We know there is some evidence on BPA affecting our hormones and DEHP being linked to cancer, but there is not enough evidence or knowledge on how this will affect humans in the years to come. 8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have phthalates in their body along with 93% of us having BPA in our urine. WTF? My eyes were quite wide throughout the whole video. I couldn't believe that this was not being talked about enough in the news, with doctors, and among my peers in class. I feel as though in the future this will be a bigger topic but there needs to be a jump start in research before it is too late.

The Elite Machine Behind Greta Thunberg,"[A look at the powerful, elite-backed machine behind Greta Thunberg and the true agenda behind her world tour.](https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/the-elite-machine-behind-greta-thunberg/)

In the matter of a few months, Greta Thunberg went from a lone girl protesting in front of the Swedish parliament to an international phenomenon. Although mass media is making it seem as if this meteoric rise to prominence happened organically, this is simply not true.

Behind Greta is a major machine, one that is controlled by major international actors and backed by major funds. This PR machine has allowed Greta to make the covers of magazines, become the subject of thousands of news articles while being photographed with world leaders and giving speeches at elite organizations such as the United Nations.

Although Greta might very well be genuinely concerned with the fate of the planet, her message is carefully crafted by those who control her to generate a specific response from the youth. In short, Greta is the face of a major marketing scheme – a tightly coordinated international effort to sell global warming through a specific lens: Fear, panic, and urgency.

Before going further, I need to point out that I am neither a “climate denier” nor a “climate activist”. That is not my field of expertise. I never analyzed any data regarding climate change and its correlation with human activity. I am far from qualified from speaking about this issue so I won’t.

My field of expertise is mass media and its relation to power. In the “[Read This First](https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/mind-control-theories-and-techniques-used-by-mass-media/)” article of this site, I explained (using quotes from the founders of the field of Communications such as Edward Bernays) how mass media is used to shape and mold opinions. The rise of Greta to international prominence is a clear-cut case of “agenda-setting” which is defined as follows:

&gt;Agenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting:  
the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;  
media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.

📷

**A classic representation of the agenda-setting theory.**

Most media outlets are owned by a handful of mega-corporations, making it very easy for the elite to saturate the world with a specific message. And the meteoric rise of Greta is a result of this kind of media saturation. In fact, her entire movement is undeniable proof of the extreme reach and power of mass media in the world today which is able to create massive movements out of nothing.

Mass media programming is particularly effective on those who did not develop an acute sense of critical thinking – notably young people. And the Greta phenomenon was custom-made to cater to this very specific demographic.

Here’s a look at the rise of Greta.

# Family Ties

**A young Greta posing with her famous parents for a magazine. Notice the** [**one-eye sign**](https://vigilantcitizen.com/vc-resources/the-one-eye-sign-its-origins-and-occult-meaning/) **made by both children.**

Greta Thunberg’s father is actor Svante Thunberg, whose father is actor and director Olof Thunberg. Her mother is the famous opera singer Malena Ernman who became a celebrity at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009. In 2010, Ernman was named Hovsångerska (translated to “court singer”) by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

📷

**Ernman on the cover of Vi magazine. The quote under her face says: “We all sell our souls to the devil”. Can’t make this up.**

In 2017, Ernman won the WWF “Environmental Hero” award for her “involvement in the climate issue for the past several years”. About a year later, Ernman’s 16-year-old daughter is seen protesting in front of the Swedish parliament. The perfect storm begins.

# Rise to Prominence

📷

**Greta photographed during her first climate strike.**

On August 20th, 2018, Greta Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish Parliament with a sign saying “School strike for the climate”. Four days later, the book *Scenes From the Heart* was published by her mother.

📷

**The cover of** ***Scenes From the Heart.***

Written as a “family autobiography”, the book discusses various issues such as Greta’s Asperger’s syndrome, which Ernman describes as a “superpower”. In one bizarre passage, Ernman states that Greta can actually see carbon dioxide emanating from vehicles and buildings.

The perfect timing between Greta’s strike and the book release was not a coincidence. And Greta’s strike certainly did not go unnoticed.

On the very same day of the first strike, a picture of Greta was published on the Facebook page of *We Don’t Have Time*, a “social network for climate change”. The page is managed by Ingmar Rentzhog – a specialist in financial marketing.

📷

**Rentzhog at a climate strike.**

Rentzhog is also a chairman of the Global Utmaning Board, a think tank that “promotes sustainable development within social, economic and environmental dimensions”. The Global Utmaning Board was founded by the Swedish politician and economist Kristina Persson, who is the daughter of the billionaire politician and entrepreneur Sven O. Persson.

Backed by this machine, Greta’s story garnered intense and immediate media attention in Sweden and, soon after, around the world. After a few months of weekly strikes, Greta took a year off from school to focus solely on climate change and began a tour of European cities.

During these events, a woman was often spotted “advising” Greta: Luisa-Marie Neubauer.

📷

**Luisa-Marie Neubauer with Greta.**

Neubauer is a member of ONE Campaign, an organization managed by Bill Gates and Bono, which is heavily funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

On the Associated Press’ “fact-checking” site, an article with the bizarre title [*Climate activist Greta Thunberg does not have ‘handler’*](https://www.apnews.com/afs:Content:7740750778) asserts that Luisa-Marie Neubauer does not serve as Greta’s “handler”. It nevertheless admits that Neubauer is linked with this powerful Soros-funded group.

&gt;According to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation website, “One originated in conversations between Bill Gates and Bono in the early 2000s about the need to better inform Americans about extreme poverty around the world.” The One Campaign has ties to Soros, founder and chairman of Open Society Foundations, which works to build democracies.  
Brooke Havlik, a communications officer with Open Society Foundations, told the AP that the organization has given $10 million to the One Campaign since 2011.

Through these powerful connections, Greta skyrocketed on the world stage. She gave speeches at Ted X talks, the European Parliament, the United Nations and she was even nominated for a Nobel Prize. She also met world leaders and celebrities across the world, including the Pope.

📷

**Greta with the Pope.**

Of course, mass media went into overdrive to turn Greta into a larger-than-life icon as she graced magazine covers around the world.

📷

**Greta on the cover of i-D magazine. Notice the one-eye sign.**

**Another picture of Greta. An unseen hand casts a shadow over one of her eyes. Very symbolic.**

From a lone girl protesting in front of the Swedish parliament, Greta turned into a figure of heroism and martyrdom.

📷

**A banner turning Greta into a religious figure.**

After touring Europe, Greta embarked on a boat and sailed to America where she was hailed as a hero, spawning massive school strikes wherever she went.

Through mass media, Greta became an important factor in local and international politics and made global warming a top priority in the Western world.

But what is exactly the role of Greta in the grand scheme of things?

# Greta’s Role

Although many are ready to deny this fact with great vigor (because it goes against their agenda), Greta is merely a pawn. She is controlled by powerful people and big money to promote a specific agenda. The agenda is not merely about climate change – it is about climate change through a very specific angle.

Her role was perfectly defined by Greta herself during a speech at the (very elite) World Economic Forum:

&gt;“Adults keep saying we owe it to the young people, to give them hope. But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.”

Panic and fear: Two words that lead to hasty and irrational responses based on negative emotions. And this fear and panic is being thoroughly ingrained into the youth, creating a generation that is convinced that the world is burning.

📷

**A young school girl protesting: Greta’s target audience.**

Greta is the face of a massive push across mass media and the education system to convince children that their “house in on fire”. Since children absorb the information that is given to them without any kind of questioning, this push has created a new worrying phenomenon: Eco-anxiety.

📷

**An i-D magazine headline about eco-anxiety.**

Instead of enjoying their childhood, children are growing up with a sense of dread and impending doom. Researchers are already linking environmental concerns with cases of anxiety, depression and even suicide. Greta herself communicated this feeling during her speech at the U.N.:

&gt;“How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”

Although Greta might be genuinely concerned about climate change, those behind her have a much darker agenda: To create a generation of children riddled with anxiety and depression, giving the elite carte blanche for drastic measures, ranging from tax hikes to the loss of personal freedoms. And let’s not forget the main goal of it all (which is also the main goal of the elite organizations behind Greta): The creation of a single world government, ruled by the world elite … to combat climate change, of course.

# In Conclusion

Any person who dares to take a critical look at the Greta phenomenon is immediately faced with the same backlash: “How dare you bully an autistic girl?” and “You’re a climate denier”. As seen above, this article was not about Greta herself, her looks or her mental health. It was about those behind her, the powerful machine that provided her the platform to become a media darling.

Furthermore, this article was not about “denying” climate change or any other environmental issues. It is about how this issue is “sold” through a specific lens, one that is based on fear, panic, and urgency. Like any other important issue, pollution needs to be addressed in a rational matter, starting with the core sources of the problem. In the U.S., the sectors of transportation, industry and electric power account for over 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, elite-owned corporations are the main polluters in the world today. They are the ones emitting tons upon tons of carbon dioxide in the air while dumping tons upon tons of toxic waste in water streams. Instead of tackling these industries head-on, the elite parades around an autistic girl, films world leaders clapping at her speeches and encourages children to be afraid.

Why? Because what they are truly looking for is control and submission. And the best way to obtain control and submission is by creating a fearful and panicky population that begs for governments to fix its problems.",environment,1571344044,twoeyesgood,6,0,True,2019-10-17 16:27:24

This is a change that began on an individual level,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ei038ah4ebt31.jpg

The cause to help protect our planet is one that has become one that is very personal to me. Sustainability is the most important aspect for every human on the planet today. The urgency to act towards this cannot be greater. If we do not move towards a sustainable future, then there is no future left for this planet. This is a change that began on an individual level where I realised the level of self-discipline to act and my own eco-consciousness developing with the products I use. As a consumer, seeking products that are better for the planet meant that as an entrepreneur, my drive to develop these types of products became strong.

Since we began our mission to pave the future for mobile accessories, one that helps protect our planet instead of damaging it, the words and actions of one particular person have stood out to me. Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist from Sweden, has been a name I have brought up with my team time and time again during this journey. However, it was her most recent speech that struck me most. “How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business-as-usual”, she said during the UN Climate Action Summit last month. It became clear that our actions by making 100% Biodegradable cases is the way forward in this industry. Our spirit of innovativeness is driving us to create accessories that look and feel just as good as the plastic alternatives, but don’t harm our planet in the way that they do. Uunique was founded upon recognising a gap in the market for mobile accessories with real style, and being able to nurture that history in a way what is sustainable for our planet is the only way to go from now.",environment,1571411107,CoralLychee,0,3,True,2019-10-18 11:05:07

"I lost loved ones in one of the firestorms. Lets sue fossil fuel corps for the cost of reversing climate change, damages and fraud.","Hi r/environment folks,

A while ago an extreme firestorm killed people I loved and ruined my life.  Extreme winds and extremely low humidity was heavily accelerated by climate change. Hurricane force winds knocked electric lines owned by our negligent electrical corp PG&amp;E into trees.  Sparks became flaming hurricanes as the extreme winds billowed oxygen into the infernos.  Houses disappeared. Metal melted.  Propane tanks burning up sounded like a warzone.  Amazing people burnt to death without meaningful time to react.  

PG&amp;E is being held liable, is pretending to go bankrupt and is improving its behavior.  Firestorm victims will probably get some money from PG&amp;E, *but we wont be safe*.  Unfortunately climate change caused the wind, and no matter how well PG&amp;E maintains its lines, firestorms and most types of disasters will keep getting worse and more frequent until we reverse climate change.

Unfortunately millions of other folks have suffered losses like me, and billions more will over time. So, litigation may be one of our more useful tools in reducing the pain of climate refugees, climate disaster survivors, family of deceased and funding climate change reversal!

Each fossil fuel corp has sold a known % of the total amount of fuels sold - of a globally hazardous product, in massive bulk and many have committed $100s of millions worth of fraud via (big tobacco's) PR firms to misdirect and delay public awareness of their crimes.  Disasters increase in severity and frequency consistent with climate scientist's forecasts.  Fossil fuel corps are liable for the % of damages that are completely outside the norm for disasters, called extreme outliers.  They're also liable for the cost of adaptation to sea level rise.  They're also liable for the cost of reversing climate change.  Each corp is individually liable based on the % it sold.  Everyone else on the planet is a victim of fossil fuel fraud and fossil fuel sales&gt;GHGs&gt;climate change&gt;foretold outlier disasters.

If you aren't convinced folks can win major class action litigations against large corps for creating obfuscatable, complex, real hazards to the public then rewatch *Erin Brockovich*, its roughly accurate. 

Would you like to sue fossil fuel corps together?

What do we do next?

Need help finding a base ingredient for a biodegradable product,"So I need help.

I've been working on creating some plastic alternative products that currently aren't on the market but I've had difficulty finding a base ingredient that wont lead to more negative emissions or environmental degradation (e.g. most biodegradable products can lead to high amounts of methane emission which can be potentially worse for the environment than petroleum options)

I've been looking into hemp based bio-plastic (hemp filled polylactic acid) and this relatively new biopolymer - Mango Materials, the company, sourced directly from their site - ""produces a naturally occurring biopolymer from waste biogas (methane) that is economically competitive with conventional petroleum-based plastics"" (they basically take captured methane from landfills - feed it to methane eating bacteria and the bacteria produces this type of biopolymer).

I'm leaning towards Mango Materials because it seems to be the most immediate way we can help fix the methane problem and its the safest/most effective biodegradable option but because it is a closed loop I'm a little concerned what the future impacts may look like.

What are the goals of the Environmental Movement?,"For some reason, in the last year or so more than any other, Climate Change has become one of the defining issues in contemporary western society. Hell, half of Monday night's debate was based on climate change. But my question isn't about if climate change is real, my question revolves around what are the real goals of the environmental movement. It seems lots of the people that are protesting are just complaining to the government to do something.

So my main questions are:

1. If the governments have essentially failed every time to get any significant amount of change through, why would they complain to these governments who have such a bad track record. If they've failed essentially every single time over the last 50 years why would they listen, let alone do anything this time?
2. If Climate Change is actually a serious issue, are insurance companies and the like preparing for a crisis? And why are lots of Climate Change activists like Obama buying Mansions in areas that are apparently going to be hit hard by Climate Change?
3. How is complaining to a government in a western country going to influence China, India, Russia and other developing nations? It'll be extremely hard to convince these countries to actually follow through.
4. What happens if a massive volcano erupts and that 12 years becomes 6? Are there any natural events like a volcano eruption that could affect the trajectory of climate change by releasing a ton of shit into the atmosphere?
5. Is there actually a plan to fight climate change? From what I see, it seems to be more of a wish list of demands.
6. If all of these protesters actually think that in the coming years massive disasters are going to happen why aren't they prepping? By Prepping I mean like storing up on food, precious metals, first aid, power, self defense, etc and preparing for a disaster. Noah didn't complain to anybody about a coming flood, he just built an arc. Wouldn't their effort be better spent in preparing for any potential disasters?
7. Is there actually any leadership and direction in the movement other than making these demands?
8. Not to get into any identity politics but, if Climate change is real then why do most environmentalists support mass immigration? 1st world citizens releases way more emissions than developing nations. Why don't they even support taking a break from immigration until a carbon neutral infrastructure is created? I understand the economic arguments that people aren't having enough kids, but Asians, the ethnicity that makes up a majority or so of the immigrants have less kids than Caucasians and Natives so won't there just be an endless spiral where we'll have to import more and more Immigrants just to keep the economy afloat? And if Climate Change causes 100s of millions of refugees, and they come to 1st world countries, won't that just cause more Emissions and make Climate change worse and cause a giant downward spiral where the climate crashes forever (or at least 1000s of years)?

My goal isn't to attack the Environmentalists, but is to better understand the Ideology, specifically by asking questions that no one in the mainstreams seems to have answered. I simply don't know

I see it kind of like a crash diet. You could try to lose 60 pounds in a few weeks, but you'll probably fail and even if you do succeed you'll gain it all back. From what I see, the movement isn't really changing anything except a few young minds that won't have the same point of view once their generation comes to power. Their demands are really vague and don't really have any structure. That's why lots of people have doubt and think the movement is just for political clout or something.

I can see why governments are so hesitant to pass the Green New Deal. If for some reason or another, Climate change doesn't become the massive disaster it was hyped up to be, America is economically destroyed for nothing and people will be 1000X more pissed off.

At least that's my view as someone looking from the outside in.

Bonus Question:

If Russians and the like are spending millions trying to meddle with elections, then wouldn't they be trying to make ideas that will bankrupt America like the Green New Deal popular legislation? Even if it doesn't pass, it will still shift the Overton Window of what is acceptable in politics towards radical impulsive spending.",environment,1570792904,Solidxter,6,0,True,2019-10-11 07:21:44

TL,DR: The Minor Sea at Murcia, Spain is suffering from an ecological collapse. There is no oxygen in water and thousands of marine species are dying atm

This is how the Minor Sea got contaminated after three decades of breaking the law. A half assed truth about the water that irrigated the land and a subterranean chaos of canals,desalination plants and polluting discharges that were fomented and then let out grow out of control. 
Year 2011. 
A pipe is found buried in the fields of Cartagena. The contents are tested. Its brine contaminated with nitrates, from the desalination of an aquifer contaminated by the fertilzer of nearby lands, a hazardous tipping if it reached the Minor Sea. If it were to accumulate, it could cause a [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)
 Its decided to block the pipe. Four/five workers get there with the necessary equipment, but at the last moment they are told not to block it. Its a call from the presidency of the hydrographic confederation of river Segura. The plubial agent that found the pipe comments with a friend that an officer told him to ""let be the desalination plants thing"" (declaration from the plubial agent 1932 in the Topillo case)

Its only the tip of the iceberg on whats beneath the ground. the ""desalination plants thing"" its already a problem of over one hundred illegal instalations and a network of subterranean canalizations that spill near the Minor Sea
That same year, the whole agriculture system changed. In a dry land its promoted the cultivation and orography to drain the water with the slopes so the water never gets retained.
Near the road there is a giant pipe that noone saw being installed and it has no propietary. Noone has responsability. Its a pipe that drains the water between fields and pumps it at the Minor Sea.
Year 2016
The waters of Minor Sea become a green soup for a few months. The government of Murcia and the hydrographic confederation of Segura hurry to take measures to prevent the spillings.
Year 2019
[Cold Drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_drop). (this paragraph explains the civilian damages of this year cold drop)
But there is an image that no camera took. Another disaster has been breewing for years at the Minor Sea. The levels of oxygen have been declining and the clorophyl has been rampant since this summer. The rains from 13 september made it worse.

The rest of the article explains in precise detail all the geological, political and administrative reasons that led to this disaster.

Drive small old car vs buy new electric car,"I am trying to be more environmentally friendly. For example, I live with my mother to reduce the amount of space I take up.

Where I am struggling is ditching my car. I have a bike and ride to the train station and catch a bike to go to work. It takes fifteen minutes by bike. However, having to ride with the traffic is annoying. One day I was riding on the footpath and a motorist drove past and told me not to do that because it was illegal (which it is). Then when I rode on the road, I was one day entering a narrow road and a motorist behind me had to slow down and started shouting at me, telling me to ride on the footpath instead.

My mother is against me riding my bike and so has purchased a brand new car for herself and given me her old bomb, a 2001 small Japanese car. It works fine and I find that it is much more convenient driving to the station.

Are food delivery apps good for the environment?,"There is an opinion article below about how bad food delivery apps like Deliveroo are. According to the writer, food delivery apps encourage people to stay at home and be lazy and eat while workers are being exploited. They discourage people from being social and instead encourage them to stay isolated.

However, usually when people are lazy and go out, they prioritise convenience, and as a result they usually drive to where they need to be. However, if these people order food via a delivery app then the company needs to be work out the most profitable way to deliver the food there, and it is usually via bike, ebike, or motorbike, which is far more energy efficient and via car.

The more I look at it, a lot of environmental degradation comes from being ""social"" and living a normal life whereas the most environmentally friendly way of living seems to be a lifestyle taken from a dystopian movie e.g. living by yourself in an apartment next to work, working all the time, never travelling, never socialising, walking to work, watching TV or reading books for recreation, etc.",environment,1570945507,hmgEqualWeather,2,2,True,2019-10-13 01:45:07

If anyone needs capital for charitable projects or environmentally friendly projects like green energy or gas to power replacing coal or diesel, oil and gas companies would invest billions if they can be shown via a secular mainstream TV series broadcast worldwide doing this in the countries they operate in.

If the projects are shown to make money the general public will invest in those companies and countries profiled. Further if financial institutions are shown to facilitate investments by mitigating corruption into developing countries they would attract more capital to their funds.

Ice Breakers Contribute to the Melting of Polar Ice,"For  those who don't know, an icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat  designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters and provide  safe waterways for other boats and ships to ensure the quickest possible  route between two locations. Almost all of these waterways in the  northern hemisphere are created between North America and Russia for the  purpose of transferring goods.

Here's  how breaking the polar ice contributes to it's melting. Sea ice has a  bright surface; 80 percent of the sunlight that strikes it is reflected  back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark  ocean surface. Instead of reflecting 80 percent of the sunlight, the  ocean absorbs 90 percent of the sunlight. The warmer water melts the  surrounding ice.",environment,1571133736,FakeScientist01101,0,2,True,2019-10-15 06:02:16

The bulk of my research is comprised of a survey, and it would mean a lot if as many people as possible could complete and share it.

"Promoting Diverse Voices in Conservation - Breaking Bio, a new Youtube Channel","Hello all,

My name is Gabi. I'm an early-career conservation biologist working at an NGO in the Washington DC Area. My speciality is in human-wildlife conflict mitigation and multivariate spatial and statistical analyses, and most of my career thus far has been in eastern and southern Africa. I've just started a Youtube Channel (videos posted weekly or biweekly) recently with a wildlife rehab professional to promote diverse voices in conservation.

As a person of color who is also nonbinary, I grew up without any role models in the sciences that looked like me or that shared my experience, and representation, as I grow in the field, has been incredibly important in my development. I want to do the same thing for other early-career scientists or conservationists and to highlight the incredible breadth and variety of career paths in conservation and in STEM.

**So, I'm looking for interviewees!** If you are a diverse person in conservation or in STEM, and you're interested in promoting your work, we want to hear from you. Interviews are between 15-30 minutes long, and any interview questions would be sent to you ahead of time for your perusal and approval. I'm most free after before 8 AM or after 6:30 PM on weekdays Eastern Standard Time and can be flexible on most weekends. If you don't want to be an interviewee but are interested, please subscribe to be kept in the loop!

 Join in the global online premiere of Rosario Dawson’s award-winning documentary that many are calling the *environmental film the world has been waiting for.* With the planet on the brink of ecological disaster, and chronic disease rates skyrocketing, this is a story of real-world SOLUTIONS. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

#### The United Nations estimates that at the rate we are depleting our farmland, we have fewer than 60 years of soil left on Earth.

### Can we feed the world without destroying the planet?

**The answer depends on what we do now!**

The good news is, there ARE solutions. *The Need To GROW* takes you inside the hearts and innovations of three very different leaders - an 8-year-old girl challenges the ethics of a beloved organization - a renegade farmer struggles to keep his land as he revolutionizes resource-efficient agriculture - and an accomplished visionary inventor faces catastrophe in the midst of developing a game-changing technology.

Narrated by Rosario Dawson (*Marvel’s The Defenders*, *The Lego Batman Movie*), *The Need To GROW* delivers an epic story of solutions and the struggles to implement them. It will make you laugh, make you cry, give you chills, and inspire you to participate in the restoration of the Earth.

##### “No human being on the planet should miss this film.”

*— Society of Voice Arts and Sciences*

##### “Perhaps the best film on sustainability I have ever seen.”

*— Teddy Grouya, Founding Director - American Documentary Film Festival*

We Need a Real Climate Accord,"   
Shouldn't our environmental flank be focused on more than the right policies at home? If this is a global collective action problem, then in the end game, don't we need to also show leadership on the world stage, and push for the kind of Real Climate Accord that won't fall apart with the first free-rider nation, the first right-wing election in a major emitting country, the first profit-first administration that sees no harm in letting other countries decarbonize first? RealClimateAccord.com stands for the idea that our international framework should be science-based, accountable, monitorable, enforceable, and have real incentives to comply. It's a simple thing, a foundational thing, and a loud silence in the movement right now.

Yes, while all our local and national efforts to impact climate change are important and necessary, there's a very real case to be made that tackling a global collective action problem with purely voluntary contributions at the national level shouldn't work, hasn't worked, isn't working now. The demand for a Real Climate Accord can be a common denominator for people across the political spectrum, at every level of civil society. And especially within the environmental movement, the least we can push for on the international stage is that, however countries choose to reach their goals, those goals should be real: that is, science-based, measurable, monitored, incentivized, enforceable.

This is the endgame we never speak of, perhaps because it's not politically possible today. But it will be politically inevitable before this is over. And we should hasten that day.

What is negative for this spinning ball of our known elements in our solar system? I don’t think humans can judge what is positive or negative for our planet. Rather, climate change is simply, drastically, changing the way what the “first world” has decided is the acceptable quality of life. Mother Earth is going to be fine. Life will continue. We are a small part of life on this planet and we selfishly view the inevitable changes as unacceptable. The millisecond or second or minute on the clock of life that we have participated in is monumentally inconsequential. The argument isn’t about saving or protecting earth. It’s about continuing what we have decided is a good life for ourselves. I truly believe that humans have begun a process that will see our current way of life nonexistent. But I also believe that we can work together to try and help create a new way for all of us to live together that coexists with what life will exist in the conditions we have helped (or condemned) earth to support.

Root Environmental Issue,"The root cause of negative environmental impact is overpopulation. Scientists think that the planet can only sustain 2 billion people in perpetuity, and we have almost 6 billion more than that already.

All the environmental initiatives are only temporary palliative band aids. China proved limiting births is not feasible. The forces against it are misgivings of racism, xenophobia and eugenics. 

The root cause of these misgivings and unwillingness to look at the root cause of environmental destruction is limited intelligence among average people. 

Just anecdotally, I have the honor of hanging with a coterie of intellectuals from Cambridge, MA, mostly females, who are smarter than I am. Most have PhD's. None of the women have or will have any children. Not that any of them think one person can make any difference on the environment by not having children, but they want to live in the spirit of their knowledge. They also want freedom and wealth.

An example of the environmental impact of not having children is thus: I don’t have children. I calculated that compared against a person who has two, and his kids follow suit, and grand kids, over the three generations, I will have polluted 1/16th as much, and used up 1/16th of the resources exploited by the other man. I don’t have to recycle and I can drive a Hummer and still be way ahead of the comparative man who might be trying his best to be environmentally responsible, irrespective of the children.

Ethical question: wheat or bison?,"As a carnivore transitioning to mostly plants, I have come across an ethical dilemma. I work on a wild bison ranch in western Nebraska, US. Raising bison functions as regenerative agriculture for the grasslands and prairies in this area: bison evolved with the grasses, their hoofs grind native seeds into the soil, their dung is good for the soil, certain birds rely on them etc. They also require very little externally provided food: they can dig through 5 ft of snow to forage grasses, dig up minerals in the soil, and break ice for water. The operation I work on is grass fed only, with hay in the winter. As far as I can tell, the op I work on is the closest to sustainable meat one can produce in the US. 

All that being said, when considering non arable lands/land that requires fertilizer yearly to be agriculturally viable, which is more ethical, from an environmental standpoint, growing bison or growing wheat/corn/soybeans etc? 

I asked this question of the vegetarians of reddit and got an unbelievable number of canned animal rights responses. I am not interested in the ethics of animal use or consumption. Instead, I am interested in the ethics of producing native vs non native species, or producing one species that helps the soil but hurts the air vs one that helps the air but hurts the soil.

Potential ways to achieve energy and nutritional sustainability.,"Following a drunken discussion on overpopulation with some friends, I had some ideas on how to achieve energy and nutritional sustainability, without resorting to population controls.

I warn first, I'm not even close to any kind of scientist, what I've pieced together, is based on internet searches.

&amp;#x200B;

Global initiative to create massive amounts of renewable energy, collect 1% of the potential solar energy that falls to earth 0.89 PetaWatt. Paid for by a global tax on everyone. 1.

Construction of alternative renewable energy production.

Switch to plant based diets, grown in hydroponics, as well as on land, using most efficient technologies available. 2. 

Small, resource cheap and healthy meats, poultry, fish. 

Otherwise, use of grown or ""cultured"" meat. 3.

Reduction of global lifestock of cows, sheep, pigs, which reduces need for agriculture land to feed them.

Sustainable food production.

Incredible focus on science. Education and survival of all people on the world, regardless of country of original, wealth, race, or gender.

&amp;#x200B;

1. potential energy on earth.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_energy\_resources#Renewable\_resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_resources#Renewable_resources) 

""89 PW\[26\] of solar power falls on the planet's surface. While it is not possible to capture all, or even most, of this energy, capturing less than 0.02% would be enough to meet the current energy needs.""

Here is the estimated amount humans have contributed to CO2 level over 220 years. (spoiler: 2.95% or 3.8 ppm in 220 years),"&amp;#x200B;

[ ](https://i.redd.it/dyzv54v6e7r31.png)

CO2 sources (119 + 88 + 6.3 = 213.3) human source: 6.3 of total 213.3 = 2.95%

In 2019 CO2 = 410 ppm - 280 ppm in 1800 (industrial revolution) = 130ppm total co2 during human industrial times

2.95% of 130 = It took humans 220 years to add 3.8ppm (probably less than 3.8ppm because highest output started in the 1950s) 

 It's  a good estimate using all the sources in the IPCC's simplified diagram.  In 220 years the CO2 level is up by 130ppm, an average gain of .59ppm  per year. You're all probably right the gain is likely related to the  earth's largest CO2 sink the oceans. I'm sure you are aware that cool sea water can hold more CO2 than warm sea water. [Here](http://climate4you.com/images/SolarIrradianceReconstructedSince1610%20LeanUntil2000%20From2001dataFromPMOD.gif)  is a good explanation for slightly warmer oceans. The increase in w/m2  correlates well with the rise in CO2 and temperature of the present. You  can compare it with [Berkeley's](http://berkeleyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/annual-comparison-small.png) theirs goes back to 1750.

The soultion to slash and burn agriculture,"Ever since 1961 palm oil companies have been blanketing Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore and thick haze that affects these countries politically, economically, and socially. Haze has caused political tension between these countries, businesses struggling to function and children unable to leave their own homes. Recently, Malaysia and Singapore have decided they have had enough of Indonesia turning a blind eye by allowing these palm oil companies to continue to burn land in order to get ready to plant new trees faster and have begun to push Indonesia into creating some sort of change. Something must be done in Indonesia as it is hurting the relationships between the countries, the economy, and the people in order to fix this Indonesia and Malaysia need to follow Singapore’s example of Transboundary Haze Pollution Act in order to slow down the use of slash and burn method and eventually eliminate it completely. On a personal scale, consumers can look for palm oil products with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) label. Which is a verification that these companies use harmless harvesting methods. Indonesia must invest in more educational campaigns and stricter law enforcement in order to educate the locals and regulate the burning. Completely shutting down the palm oil industry will be disastrous for their local economy so it is important to use other methods, although they may be more time consuming, it will be worth it in the long run as the tensions between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore will decrease, the economy will not go through rough stretches during the haze season, and people will begin to live healthy lives as they are breathing much cleaner air.",environment,1570520940,NSDJAKDA,2,3,True,2019-10-08 03:49:00

Absolute Nonsense from r/Conservative,"A friendly reminder that listing a handful of cherry-picked claims from politicians, non-experts, and media headlines as the basis of your scientific (sic) understanding of global environmental degradation makes you look ridiculous.

Original thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/de4ino/the_science_is_settled/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Science is never settled, yes, but the reality of global environmental degradation is as settled as the science could possibly be; in fact, it is as settled as the link between cigarettes and lung/cardiovascular diseases (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://whatweknow.aaas.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whatweknow_website.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjitYeoz4rlAhWCl-AKHa3YATYQFjAAegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0L4hcQn4F3gKULSzIH7mn6). But since the nature of science means it may never be ""settled,"" per se, cigarettes may not be bad for you after all so just smoke away, right? What's the harm in 2 packs a day?

The greenhouse gas effect has been established science since the late 1800s. General intellect (as evident by the moon and Venus) and 5th grade science experiments aside (involving some Alka seltzer, a lamp, and two plastic bottles/thermometers), the consensus of 97%+ of climatologists over tens of thousands of academic papers and multi-decadal periods of rigorous analysis, is that anthropogenic GHG emissions are driving global warming. Period. From 1965-1969 7 total academic papers predicted global cooling compared to 42 predicting warming. SEVEN. Since then, our understanding of the science has improved dramatically, as we see in scientific institutions like the NAS, and their perspective of not having a ""good quantitative understanding of our climate machine"" (1975) to now shifting to ""there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occuring"" after studies on the subject (which were consensus at the time of the ""global cooling"" Time magazine headline, anyway) have grown from a few dozen to tens of thousands. Additionally, it takes only a fraction of advanced thought to understand the nuance to these sorts of things like ""climate predictions"". For example, RCP 4.5 assumes radiative forcing stabilization by 2100, but there are literally billions of other variables that could alter the predictions inherent therein over time. Most modern climate models are likewise overly conservative anyway as 1) they depend on the most conservative scenarios for radiative forcing 2) most take no account of negative feedback loops, like the (potential) Dragon's Breathe methane feedback from melting Siberian permafrost 3) they are built off of historical data, and as we deviate further and further from the mean the models could potentially become more and more out-of-touch (conservatively) and 4) many of them now assume mass adoption of widely deployable, cost-effective, and highly productive carbon capture technology that doesn't even exist yet.

This is real, and it is happening. And it's not just warming either. It is important that people understand this, so, instead of posting a meme of easily refuted denialist talking points from the Heritage Foundation, I'll post a list of scientifically verifiable summaries and backups of what we know below for interested readers to explore at their leisure, and would further advise everyone to read much, MUCH more about these issues from the gargantuan amounts of publicly available information from other sources that is out there online, or available through a small subscription payment to a more reliable source, like Nature Mag, or Science Mag.

The planet is warming, and CO2 levels are growing at an unprecedented rate. We have already warmed ~0.9°C since the late 19th century with most of that warming taking place in the last 35 years alone. Ice sheets ARE melting, the hydrological cycle IS changing, and our normal seasonality and other items like the jet stream and overturning circulation ARE changing.

Something that disgusts me about human nature lies in the question of climate change.," We are all saying we are gonna try to change climate many of us do manifestations and marchs for climate.

however my questions are :

\- Do you still use the plane for you vacacions ?

\- Do you still prefer a new phone or laptop instead of repairing your old one ?

\- Do you prefer taking the car because sometimes it is faster than public transports ?

\- Do you continue to eat no seasonal fruits/vegetables and importing them for example from spain, south america etc ?

\- Do you still prefer your big brands like LVM GUCCI ARMANI ?

\- Do you still prefer to use a car which uses oil instead of electricity ?

\- Do you still buy on the net which most of the online companies use planes and cargo boats to deliver your goods ?

\- Do you still go to parties ? Your alcool drinks have to be imported and their ingredients have to be imported too.

\- Do you go to bed early to avoid unnecessary electricity consumption ?

\- Do you still buy imported goods ? (around 60% of the Co2 emissions).

&amp;#x200B;

Well budies what i see is that most of us are asking for changes but we will not accept that those things listed above will change. So how can you say that you want to fight climate change if most of you would not accept to change what's above ? Because going to green energies will not solve most of those issues because it will not be enough to sustain our energetic needs. 

The fact that most of us say that we are climate activists but when asked to change those habits most refuse... It's disgusting and it's the reality. That's the reason most of the politics refused to address the climate change issue. We have habits and comforts and we will refuse to give up on them.

to solve the climate change issue it is certain that we will have to diminish our living conditions and our comfort but will you accept it ?

What disgusts me about human nature is that there are lots of people dying of hunger in the world while 1 bilion $ per year could solve the issue. but we never considered it an issue however when the world is changing and people begin to have fear for their own asses and their future children we begin to do something...

Can massive development of multi story wood buildings reduce CO2 from atomsphere?,"If forest is cut and replanted, and the wood is not burned or rotten, the carbon will be preserved in the wood.

&amp;#x200B;

Multi story residential buildings have better heat profile than single family homes, which reduce HVAC cost and heating fuel consumption.  The timber in the wood buildings are treated with preservatives which prevent the wood from rot.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if we massively develop multi story wood buildings, can we both solve the housing affordability crisis and reduce CO2 ?

I'm from Alberta, Canada where we produce a lot of beef, and I have a hard time believing that raising cattle is worse for the environment than flying/trucking in beans/meat alternatives from say Mexico or further. I know cattle create methane, but there is also the benefit that they're a natural part of their ecosystem.

Cloth vs. Disposable Diapers,"I've been working as a nanny for about 5 years. This particular family has a 4 and 5 year old along with a new 6 month old. You can imagine I've changed enough diapers to last me a lifetime. As I was changing the 6 month old last week I thought about all the disposable diapers I had gone through the short 6 months. Diapers on average take about 500 years to decompose, this worried me even more. I started to do some research on the different options parents have when it comes to diapers. While there are numerous brands on the market, cloth and disposable were the two main types. Many parents who are conscious of the environment might believe that cloth diapers are the way to go but in truth its not really helping the environment that much at all. Cloth diapers are reusable and gentle on sensitive skin. Disposable diapers usually have dyes that irritate the baby's skin and they are not bio-degradable. From here the question is cost, how much are you paying for the first 2 years of a babies life on diapers? For cloth diapers it can run you anywhere from 800-1000 USD for cloth and 2000-3000 for disposable. The catch is, cloth diapers need to be washed daily, every couple days or weekly. The amount of energy and electricity it takes to wash them this many times might make the cost between the two equal. If you give your diapers to a laundry service it might surpass the cost of disposable. Some positive news is that more bio-degradable diapers are hitting the market. Hopefully it will become the new normal in years to come.",environment,1570071155,stephanie-saji,0,1,True,2019-10-02 22:52:35

The main element to tackle in getting System 002 out on the ocean is survivability, to design a system that can stay in the water in year-round conditions and for long periods of time, so the plastic doesn’t have to be harvested too often using vessels that cost money to send.

I work in environmental clean up and people are starting to make a run for it,"I'm not quite sure where to post this, but I have to get it off my chest. It is all so, so, so much more worse than people think. 

I work as a biologist/project manager for a large state agency. My (way too small) team oversees hazardous site cleanup, OPA and CERCLA, from the initial spill through remediation and monitoring. We partner with a lot of fed and state agencies, academia, and NGOs which means I get to work with some very smart people who know what they're doing. In many cases they are some of the original researchers. 

In the last three months, two of them have basically quit to move somewhere remote and become preppers. More and more of us are convinced that it's over. It's a trend I've noticed over the last few years. If you go to a conference you'll almost certainly hear someone talk about their bug out plan or land they're thinking about buying out in the middle of nowhere.

My friend, who has much more coding skills than I'll ever possibly have, just restyled his old project called ClimAPP.

This is it:  [https://climapp.info](https://climapp.info/)

It's based on this simple counter on the homepage that show some cool data of what's happening around the world and he also added a news aggregator that shows all the news from the major sources regarding pollution, fires, animals, global warming and climate change, and I think it's really helpful to have all the news together in the same place.

He decided to implement a donation form to raise money and split them for 8 non-profit organizations ( [/organizations](https://climapp.info/organizations) ) and yes, he explians why people should donate and also why he can't touch this money (basically, the website is supported by Google ads), that will go directly to the organizations ( [Here](https://climapp.info/about-us) ).

That's it, I would love to hear some feedback and report to him, as he might add something new or maybe implement more services on ClimAPP :)

What can we do about all the plastic,"Yo Reddit. I love going out and picking up trash as much as the next person, but it feels bad when I throw it out because I worry that it's going into the landfill to get cycled back onto the streets. What are we doing to get rid of it? Microplastic specifically? It's detrimental to just about every step of everyone's life cycle. 

I have read multiple stories about bacteria that are able to eat plastic, why isn't this a widespread technology yet? The planet needs a little elbow grease right now, I feel that if we got the plastic out of the environment, we would be better off.  I know it's not a single-solution problem, it's a multi-faceted issue with a thousand heads and like a hydra, cutting off a head seems to spout two or sometimes three new ones.

 We do have 7.53 billion minds and 15.06 billion pairs of hands. Babies born every second of every day, forever. It is our responsibility to do absolutely everything within our power to contribute to fixing the state of the planet. We owe it to future generations to do this because it is our fault. How, you might ask? How is it our fault that the environment is trashed, when we recycle and pick up trash off the streets?

Because we are sick. Humanity is sick. We are lazy, we are irresponsible. We shirk our work onto the next person without realizing we have just doubled our work for the next day. 

But we can get better; just like Earth is sick, but can get better.

Ferrochrome Plant proposal need more awareness.,"In the recent months a proposal has been granted for a new Ferrochrome plant to be build in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada. This plant will produce 110 tons of emission per year will be released into the air. These airborne emissions will contain chromium 6 (despite the measures employed by Outukumpu), as well as nickel, lead and vanadium. 20,000 tonnes per year of contaminated waste will need to be dumped somewhere. Probably it will end up in tailing ponds. Predictably these will leak and some amount of chromium 6 will end up in the groundwater, just a matter of how much. 167 trucks per day carrying slag, waste and Ferrochrome across the international border, over the St. Mary's river. This plant will be needing 24 million cubic meters of water per year. Which will most likely be getting that resource from the river and dumping it back out to flow into all of the Great Lakes. Sault Ste Marie is the main connection port for Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. If this plant gets built it will be devastating for the environment , and for the near 100,000 people living in it's shadow. 

Please share and spread awareness of the dangers of this plant.

I wrote a strongly worded message to Tim Hortons and hope sharing it here will help get their attention!,"Hello
My name is **** and I am a student at the university of Saskatchewan and have always been a large supporter of Tim Hortons. However, I have been witnessing a practice that has left me frustrated. Like many people today, I am trying to be more conscious of my carbon footprint and the amount of waste I am putting into the environment. One way I try to do this is by refusing plastic cups and using a reusable coffee cup whenever purchasing a drink. Over the past few weeks, I picked up on the fact that Tim Hortons employees use a plastic cup to make ice coffee, then dump it into the reusable cup and throw the plastic into the trash. I would assume this is to make sure that they are only pouring the correct amount, but for the consumer it is frustrating to see that even when using a reusable cup, the same amount of plastic is being thrown out. Since noticing this, I have seen it happen every time I attempt to use my reusable cup to get an ice coffee for the past 3 weeks. I would like to see a change in this procedure, for example using a measuring cup that is not thrown away and can be washed between uses. I believe that everyone has a part to play in reducing waste, and the practice of using plastic to dump into reusable cups is hindering Canadians ability to cut single use plastic out of a easy everyday purchase. Please make a change and help reduce the single use plastic that is ending up in our oceans.

"Tokyo's climate strike happened at 5pm, but at least it happened.","My friend and I happened to be in Tokyo during the climate strike and so we joined in theirs while we were there.  
It was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.  


Once we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.  


Mind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.  


It was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great!

We need to stop complaining,"Now don't get me wrong. The situation is dire. It's important face all of the factual information and not put our heads in the sand about it.

But complaining about Trump, complaining about Brazil, the evil oil companies, the billionaire oligarchy, blah blah blah. It's not helping us. There are so, so many people who understand the gravity of the situation and are ready to take action. If you're reading this, you're probably one of those people.

All of the complaining is just a distraction. It doesn't do anything. Do you think the oil executives have hurt feelings because a bunch of people are saying about how evil they are? They don't. Do you think the people running think tanks generating climate denialist propaganda feel sad at night because people are accusing them of destroying the planet? They don't. Do you think your average Joe Trump supporter is worried that you think he's stupid? He's not.

Here's what can possibly make a difference, if anything can. You have a circle of influence. Your professional network, social network, local, state and federal elected representatives, etc. Do whatever you can to create change within that circle. And also do everything you possibly can to expand your circle. Focus on the highest leverage, bang for your buck things you can do. Can you plant a tree and do meatless Mondays? Fine. Can you get your church or college to plant a forest garden? Even better. Can you coordinate a political campaign to unseat your apathetic congressional representative (or senator!) and replace them for someone who's on fire for the green new deal? Better still. Start where you are, do the best thing you can think of, and learn as you go.

Complaining is a low-leverage action. It takes up a lot of emotional energy and doesn't get us anywhere. So many of us care so deeply and yet we are sticking to low leverage responses to the situation ... it pretty much ensures our demise. It's what the oil executives are counting on. The propaganda isn't just to convince climate denialists, it's also to distract the rest of us and channel our energy into impotent rage.

Climate Change: Effect of housing or really growth in roof structures,"Can someone help me?  Has there been studies on the effect of roof structures on earth in terms of global warming?  To me, carbon and other products in our atmosphere is one thing, and may contribute.  But if you just look at these quick calculation and think about it in terms of common sense, it seems the number of people and covering those people with roof structures would contribute way more to global warming than anything else. Roofs are generally heat absorbing and building vast suburbs or housing from what once was trees multiplies the effect by remove trees and natural habitat that can deal with the heat from the sun (and trees that removed carbon).  

In 1970 the population on earth was 3.7 billion.  If they occupied 45 sq meters per person it would require 166.5 billion sq meters of roofing.  

In 2019 the world population is 7.7 billion.  And home sizes are larger so perhaps we now occupy 50 sq meters per person. that would be 385 billion sq meters of roofing! More than double.  

Now this doesn't account for multiple levels and certain places perhaps the homes are much smaller like in China  but still there is no doubt built structures occupy way more than it used to. I don't even account for additions for roofing in work places, grocery stores, etc all things that come with more people.  

You can cut carbon all you want if you don't deal with population explosion we're in big trouble.  Plus I noticed in 1950 the world population was 2.5 billion, so it took 20 years to go up 1.2 billion but from 2010 we were at 6.9 billion and went to 7.7 billion in just 9 years an increase of .8 billion.

Nanoparticles enter the body from breathing the air, or from eating food and water where they enter directly into the bloodstream, and also by passage through the skin. They also have the potential to penetrate the blood–brain barrier due to their small size. Nanoparticles can interact with proteins and enzymes, alter gene expression, and thus affect the biological behavior at the organ, tissue, cellular, sub-cellular, and protein levels.

Nanoparticles affect fish and move up the food chain. Scientists think that nanoparticles cling to certain types of proteins the fish need to transport fats through their bloodstream. They found clear indications of a decrease in the burning of fats in the fish, which supports this hypothesis. As seen with environmental toxins such as DDT, heavy metals and hormone suppressants, it’s long been known that toxins can be carried up the food chain and accumulate in animals atop the pyramid. This is the first study showing nanoparticles passing up links in the food chain in the same way.

After crossing the blood brain barrier, nanoparticles have a tendency to accumulate in specific brain regions, where they can access the neural cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.

The neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is usually caused by the extensive production of reactive oxygen species that lead to oxidative stress. Subsequently, the release of cytokines causes neuroinflammation, and finally, through apoptotic mechanisms, neuronal death. Many of the commonly used nanoparticles, including titanium dioxide nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and carbon-based nanoparticles, have been reported as potentially neurotoxic materials.

Iron oxide nanoparticles reach the brain by crossing the blood brain barrier, or through the olfactory nerve, which affects synaptic transmissions and nerve conduction, causing neural inflammation, apoptosis, induced neural antioxidant responses, and immune cell infiltration.

Gold nanoparticles reach the brain through the olfactory nerves and by crossing the blood brain barrier. In the latter case, gold nanoparticles might cause three types of severe neurological pathologies: astrogliosis, also known as reactive astrocytosis, characterized by an increased number of astrocytes that is caused by the death of adjacent neurons, which leads to scar formation and the inhibition of axon regeneration, increased seizure activity, defined as any change in the electrical activity of the brain, and cognition defects, such as attention, memory, and judgement impairments.

Silica nanoparticles can reach the brain intranasally and leads to cognitive dysfunction and impairment, but also to pathologies that are similar to neurodegeneration and synaptic changes. 

Carbon nanoparticle inhalation leads to accumulation in the olfactory bulb, inducing an inflammatory response by activating the microglial cells.

Are we framing climate change the right way?,"Since the widespread engagement of social media there has occurred a shift in how the anthropogenic climate change issue has been pitched to the general public. I think that isn't unique to this issue, but rather indicative of a more broad conceptual shift in civil discourse. A constant barrage of emotional triggers during our daily consumption of social media has resulted in moral conviction that I would argue was not as extreme in 1990s and early 2000s western society. Popular narratives are now given as absolutes. In my opinion, the assumptions we hold bout certain issues shape the outcomes of the solutions to those issues. It frames how we view solutions.

The climate change debate is interesting to me because the popular narrative has been highly politicized and highly propagandized. How the issue has been penned in modern discourse tends to espouse one, or all, of the following assumptions:

\- Antagonist: Fossil fuel companies who value profit over life.

\- Antagonist: Political figures who allow emissions to increase.

\- Antagonist: Rich people

\- Protagonist: Poor people

\- Protagonist: Environment

\- Protagonist: YOU - if you can help.

I think that this popular conceptualization of the issue is very smart, because it really encourages people to at least nominally support the narrative as an act of moral virtue. By framing this in terms of protagonist/antagonist - and by providing a face to the antagonist - peoples' voting behaviour in particular can be really influenced.

However, I think this is a fundamentally wrong way to think about the issue. Fossil fuel consumption is a reality in our world due to our current technology. Fossil fueled powered technologies have ushered in literally the most prosperous epoch in the entire history of humanity. In the last 15 years, global abject poverty has effectively halved. Global GDP growth in poorer nations are at full speed and inertia - agricultural output is up - starvation is at record lows.

Those fossil fuel companies exist to provide that cheap and available source of energy to people who want to buy them. Those political figures generally are very reluctant to put hard caps on emissions - or taxes high enough to encourage that - because of the inevitably enormous fall out from lowering the overall welfare of their populace. Poor people disproportionately benefit from fossil fuels - especially in the developing world where fossil fuel power is lifting them out of poverty. Therefore, emissions likely will not diminish to any meaningful degree so long as fossil fuels are the cheapest and most reliable option.

This opens up some legitimately important topics of discussion. Such as - what would be the perfect mix of a pigovian tax on carbon, and tax write offs for renewables industries, to provoke that change without lowering GDP? What are ways we can utilize market forces to encourage the change most expeditiously? 

I think that the popular espousing of a class warfare worldview, or an antagonist/protagonist narration, has politicized this issue to the point where it has become conflated with partisan politics. It has prevented people from working together politically to create a solution to the problem - which will almost certainly have to involve major corporations in conjunction with global governments. Far more would be accomplished if we focused on lowering the price point of renewables, than if we simply continued down the path of partisan politics concerning climate change, based on faulty assumptions. This goes for the left and the right.",environment,1569601851,SkippyMGee,4,3,True,2019-09-27 12:30:51
Understanding people,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing because I would like to understand people who say ""What difference does it make if I recycle my rubbish/trash if my neighbour don't do that and I am no one significant and it won't make difference""

I am not an activist or someone like that I am just a regular person with an ordinary life same job that most people hate. To be honest this is my ever first post anywhere on internet as I am generally interested why people think so.

So why I am writing this post you might think so here are some of the reasons why I'm writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not writing because I think we should start to eat grass or not use planes or any other technology what we have. That would be a ridiculous thing to say in this age and definitely not possible.

So I am writing this post because I do recycle as much rubbish/trash as I can, also I am not dropping any garbage on streets or forest or where ever in nature I might be. And there are some people who I just cannot get with their ideology on this matter.

I'm doing that because I have seen how much whether have changed in the past 10 years how it affects life and nature. How it has impacted the farmers, animals and biological environments in general.  
So I started to recycle as much as I can maybe I won't make a difference but maybe when I have kids and my kids have kids and so on I have made enough impact to allow them to live in a better and cleaner environment.  


My thought of it as follows and this is the reason I am recycling:  
When I have kids or they have kids will they have a planet to live on that is not so badly polluted so that they don't have to live in my waste because I thought ""Well I won't make a difference so what the hell"".

If through the history people who have driven our science, medicine and technology and so would have had the same thought maybe you and me would not be here also.  
It is not that if you can or cannot make a difference if no one is willing to take a step then there will not be a place for our kids or grandkids to call home as we will ruin it with our ignorance.",environment,1569611171,Undersatnd,2,0,True,2019-09-27 15:06:11

I'm a programmer who just graduated University and want to start making apps which could actually help have a positive impact on the environment. I've been inspired by the amount of young people who are starting to take the dire state of the environment into their own hands.

One idea I have could be an app which displays the nearest environmental projects to users and details how one can help, e.g. a tree planting session or strike.

Another idea is a fact-checking app which looks at the most impactful politicians in your country and uses scientific facts to start holding politicians accountable to their words. Issues like Trump and Brexit have become prominent due to large amounts of misinformation and in the US and UK, citizens have been turned against each other as a result. This bickering is preventing important issues like the environment from being properly addressed. Therefore, an impartial app/website which can be used as a fact-checking tool can help combat the rise of ""fake news"".

Should I drop my Master because I have to fly?,"Hi there!

I feel rather lost and trying to get differnet opinions to make the best decision.

I got accepted to a Master in International Nature Conservation recently. It seemed like a great opportunity to advance my career and reach my goal to protect our planet and the life it inhabits. However, since this Masters is international, it requires me to travel from Germany to New Zealand for a Semester. First, I thought: ""What a unique opportunity"" and ""I'll always wanted to go to New Zealand."". Now I am in doubt, however.

I am living vegan, use public transport and bike rather than car, buy board-games (one of my hobbies) mostly second hand, stick to sustainable brands, share a flat rather than living on my own, join protests and much more. After calculating the amount of CO2 I would emit, when flying to New Zealand, I was in shock. How could it be that one return flight emits more CO2 than one average person in Germany?

I decided to not fly for leisure or short distance anymore, a while ago. But now I am also starting to think: can I really do this trip to New Zealand? Isn't that hypocritic of me? Or does the long term benefit of my travel maybe outweigh the short-term cost? After all international experience is important in the conservation sector, it is my dream to protect our planet and wildlife, and I know what I do is important. I will also definetly get involved in conservation projects in New Zealand. I even tried to find an alternative way by land and sea to get to New Zealand. The costs are huge and there aren't many options. That I only have 7 days between my semester in Germany ends and the one in New Zealand starts, does not make it any better.

I know there are other Masters out there too. I spend the whole last year trying to figure out which one to do, and this one was the best option (back then I didn't think about the CO2 I would emit by travling to New Zealand). Not taking this Master would mean that I would spend another year delaying my education.

I am just so lost at the moment, and tearing up because of the pressure which comes from ever side. Being environmental, living my life, my career . I just don't know what the right decision is anymore. I know noone can decide for me. But having others opinion might help.

Protesting for Climate Change,"It’s great that school kids are doing protests but well it’s a shame the adults are letting them do all of it alone. I believe a lot of adults do want to do more but can’t because most people can’t take time off work to protest.

What if we picked a day for everyone around the world to protest by turning off their computer and mobile phone for two hours around 10am in their own country. If possible don’t drive either for 2 hours. You could still stay in work and do other things but just doing that by shutting off, it would have a huge impact alone. People at home could do it too, possibly even have the radio and T.V off too.

Maybe some people will be allowed to go outside and do a real protest for a couple of hours but for those who can’t, they can still make their voices heard. It is kind of like Earth hour but in the middle of the work day specifically for the purpose of protesting.

I'm talking about a World Wide protest that everyone would be able to join into and would be a huge disruption. Two hours stoppage of browsing facebook, Amazon, Instagram, texting on Whatsapp, Reddit, Youtube all at once. Two hours not doing computer work. Two hours not showing up at the gas station or shops. Two hours no radio play or T.V's. The impact on advertisers would be massive. There is no bigger protest than hitting the people in charge where it hurts most, right in their pockets. Everyone joining in together it could be a really cool event, even if it was only one hour. Everyone at once damn that would be huge. People could really tell them how they feel but not have to leave work if that is out of the question for them.",environment,1569098722,Constantly_OnYo_Back,4,2,True,2019-09-21 16:45:22
"Fires rage in Borneo, dedicated local firefighters need your help","With all the outcry over the Amazon fires, i think more recent fires are being overshadowed. This summer I was lucky enough to spend a couple of weeks is the Sabangau National Park in the Central Kalimantan on the Indonesian side of Borneo. We stayed in a research camp run by the Borneo Nature Foundation, a caring group of researchers and locals committed to protecting the peatland forest, its many endangered species and carrying out vital research on this vital ecosystem and the creatures that call it home. A heavy dry season and possibly slash and burn practices to clear space for oil palm have left fires raging through some of the most pristine habitat left in Borneo. The area at risk is home to almost 6000 endangered wild Orangutans and countless other vital species. But another issue lies in the fact that Sabangau lies on dense peatland, meaning that the Co2 levels released by the fires are significantly higher than other forest fires. As a human aspect, the local City of Palangkaraya is blanketed in smoke, causing horrible respiratory problems for locals who often struggle to afford healthcare. The local firefighters over there are incredibly friendly guys with a deep love for the forest and a solid commitment to protect it. But they are significantly under-resourced and lacking in manpower. A donation of just £25 could buy them respiratory protective gear, £100 could buy longer and more modern firehoses while larger amounts could buy fire patrol boats and other vital equipment. Every donation of even £2-5 could help greatly, i will include a link where you can donate and see what your donations could help to buy. Even spreading this message however you can would be a great help. The Amazon fires are horrible, but here in a smaller area donations could have a real impact and actually have a chance to stop this fire dead in its tracks. Thank you for listening and for any help you can give. Lets kick the shit out of this fire and save us some cute ass Orangutans and Loris.

Climate Change and Veganism,"**Introduction**

Climate change, despite still being denied by many, is a well established theory with overwhelming evidence to support it. Climate scientists have been warning governments around the world for decades to take necessary steps to reduce global carbon emissions to avoid climate catastrophe, but so far not enough has been done to combat this major problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Effects of climate change**

The destabilisation of the climate negatively impacts just about every area of life. Below are three areas of life that are being impacted due to climate change:

**1) Ecosystems**

* **Erosion of the coral reef** \- “experts project that 90% of the world’s reefs will be gone by 2050. Coral reefs are among the earth’s most precious natural resources. They harbor a million species and provide food for 500 million people around the world. But warming waters, pollution and overfishing have badly damaged these precious ecosystems; roughly 50 percent of the world’s corals have been lost in just the last 30 years. [http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/](http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/)
* **Species extinction** \- “Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.” [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change)
* **Toxic red tide** \- ""Florida is having a 10-month streak of toxic red tide. This so-called red tide has killed hordes of marine animals and is entering its 10th month of existence—making it one of the longest-lasting cases documented to date...According to Glibert, there are two key factors contributing to this worldwide shift: increasing nutrient run-off from farms, lawns, and other land-based sources, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns occurring as a result of climate change. [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632)

**2) Social**

* **Water** **shortages**: ""Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world in the decades ahead."" [https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/](https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/)
* **Increased** **nutrient** **deficiency**: “**Climate** **change** will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient. Crops grown in a high CO2 atmosphere are less nutritious, containing less protein, zinc and iron” [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient)
* **Increased** **risk** **of** **diseases**: “After West Nile virus kills 22 people in heatwave, experts warn of more mosquito and tick-borne diseases due to climate change...“ [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise)

**3) Energy**

* **Wind** **turbines** \- “Heatwave knocks wind out of onshore turbines” [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp)
* **Hydropower** **dams** \- ""African nations could face devastating blackouts as rising temperatures dry up their hydropower dams. Based on recent years in which extremely dry conditions saw electricity drop off in large areas, a new report by climate scientists has warned that the trend for dam construction may be misguided.” [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html)
* **Nuclear** **power** \- ""Europe’s heatwave, however, hasn’t just increased air temperatures but also water temperatures. Regulations protecting wildlife mean that the usual water sources drawn on by nuclear plants cannot always be used for cooling, leading to shutdowns. It’s not the first time this has happened: Heatwaves forced nuclear shutdowns or curtailments across Europe in 2003, 2006, and 2015. Worse still, scientists warn that thermal power interruptions will worsen because of climate change—not just because of heatwaves but also droughts. It’s ironic that human-induced climate change is threatening a climate-friendly source of electricity. [https://qz.com/1348969/europes-heatwave-is-forcing-nuclear-power-plants-to-shut-down/](https://qz.com/1348969/europes-heatwave-is-forcing-nuclear-power-plants-to-shut-down/)

&amp;#x200B;

**How can veganism help**

There are many things an individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint, including: have fewer or no children, recycle more, walk, cycle and use public transport more, use automobiles and planes less, use less electricity, and educate others.  
One of the best ways, that is often not talked about, is to go vegan and switch to a plant-based diet.

&gt;“Which diet is best for the environment? **According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change**. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth..."" [https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/](https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/)

**1) Less water use**

[https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable](https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable)

* About one-third of the world’s water consumption is for producing animal products.
* According to data from the Pacific Institute and National Geographic, a single egg takes 53 gallons of water to produce, a pound of chicken 468 gallons, a gallon of cow’s milk 880 gallons, and a pound of beef 1,800 gallons.
* Growing crops to feed animals killed for food consumes 56 percent of water in the U.S.
* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world.
* Because animals are so densely packed on today's industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water.
* Tyson, America’s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical.
* Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.
* One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce—the equivalent of two months’ worth of showers.
* A pound of chicken requires 71 percent more water to produce than a pound of soy.

**2) Less pollution**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones around the world in our oceans. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones…water pollution. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**3) Less environmental destruction**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* The meat industry is the cause of 85% of all soil erosion. [https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/)

**4) Less species extinction**

* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction…and habitat destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Up to 137 plant, animal and insect species are lost every day due to rainforest destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**5) Less energy waste**

* “In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic\_level#Biomass\_transfer\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency)
* “Th**e ten percent law** of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next can be attributed to Raymond Lindeman (1942), although Lindeman did not call it a ""law"" and cited ecological efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 37.5%. According to this law, during the transfer of organic food energy from one trophic level to the next higher level, only about ten percent of the transferred energy is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological\_efficiency#Ten\_percent\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency#Ten_percent_law)

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

Climate change is real, human activity has been proven to be a major cause, and there are several things you can do to reduce its impact:

1. Have fewer or no children
2. Recycle more
3. Walk, cycle and use public transport more, and use automobiles and planes less
4. Switch to a plant-based diet
5. Use less electricity
6. Educate others

Tree planting guide for beginners!,"Hello everyone, 
For many years I designed and built xeriscaped landscapes for residential and small business. 
With all these highly motivated and dedicated environmentalists planting trees these days I just wanted to give some suggestions for success.
#1- Plant native trees! Native trees require little to no irrigation. 
#2- Plant trees away from the foundation of structures and water/sewer lines.
#3- Trees need space! Make sure the type of tree you get, you can maintain. Some trees get really tall and you have to hire people to trim them or they become hazards. 
#4- If you can make sure rain runoff will collect at the base of the tree or the treeline, for better results in arid climates.

-	Eating more vegan meat (cutting most of my actual meat consumption to 1 day a week (not counting eggs), only eating chicken)
-	Buying anything I can locally, organically (I live in BC, Canada so this is fairly easy)
-	Recycling (my own recycling plus anything I can take from my job that’s recyclable (with managers permission)
-	I don’t drive, I walk or take public transit if I have to (don’t have a full license) 
-	BC gets 95% of energy from hydroelectricity
-	Impose my own carbon tax on myself when buying from Amazon or eBay (with carbon emissions)
-	I do not have AC in my house (I use fans) 
-	Using dish soap, laundry soap, and body wash that isn’t made with harsh chemicals)

"Face it, no matter what Greta Thunberg says or does, humans are incapable of change to better the planet","I can see the downvotes already, so go ahead and downvote. But if you are open minded, then read my thoughts on this.

As said in the title: HUMANS WILL NOT CHANGE

As long as we keep the same governments, same religions, same economic systems, same agricultural systems, same everything that’s human relation; nothing will improve no matter how many electric cars we drive no matter how many bikes we ride. Our entire human society is based on consumption and economic growth. As long as we keep growing the population and economy, we will see more deforestation, more resource consumption, more waste, more CO2, more wildlife extinction, etc.

It’s just the truth. No one will be willing to go full vegan. No one is willing to give up having so many kids.

One example that struck me was Chloe Kim. She was talking about how her children will not know what snow is. So if you know the environment is going to crap, why bring more lives into an already dwindling planet? So you don’t care what environmental problem they will face? Sure being child free is selfish...

Come on, Bernie is talking about it now too. We need to reduce our number. We will populate this planet to complete collapse.",environment,1569267225,NewAgePhilosophr,11,0,True,2019-09-23 15:33:45

Clare's toys,"In the late 1940’s, [Fisher Price](http://www.plastics-themag.com/applications/christmas-plastic-toys-in-vogue/plastic-shakes-up-the-toy-industry)  started producing plastic toys. Since then, the industry has  contributed an almost immeasurable amount of plastic waste to the world.  With 90% of all toys sold being [plastic](http://www.plastics-themag.com/applications/christmas-plastic-toys-in-vogue/plastic-shakes-up-the-toy-industry)  this leaves quite a big footprint on our planet. One that will almost  certainly outlast not just us, but also our great grandchildren.

Those toys manufactured by Fisher Price a slight 70 years ago will  probably all have come to the end of their ‘intended’ life. So, where  are they now?

It is likely that they are sat in a rubbish tip buried somewhere all alone, miles away from the grasp of their intended user.

Just take a moment and think about that….

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;90% of toys sold in the UK are plastic.  
 

### Plastic toy consumption – who is to blame?

There is no blame game here, other than perhaps consumerism. Some  things we need, some things we don’t. When it comes to our children,  their happiness often takes precedent and we tend to buy the plastic toy  without giving a second thought to the environment.

**Hand me downs**

Nearly all of us have received, or given or helped with the recycle  culture in some way. As good as getting the full life out of a product  is, the reality with plastic toys is that many of them only have one  use. Even if it is handed down (or across), that is still only a tiny  portion of the lifespan of a plastic toy.

It takes 450 years on [average](https://www.postconsumers.com/2011/10/31/how-long-does-it-take-a-plastic-bottle-to-biodegrade/)  for plastic to degrade. As it does, the pieces get smaller and the  toxic chemicals leak into the environment meaning and in that time it  goes through many bodies (yes you), animals and even plants – a hand me  down of sorts.

### Plastic is a wonder product!

Wait what…..

It is a product that can be used again and again, is waterproof, can  be turned into so many different things, is easy to clean and is  therefore is hygienic (although not so much for a certain animal  teether). It permeates so much of our lives, that it would be impossible  to stop using it. Plastic is clearly the sensible choice for a sippy  cup amongst many other things.

### So what are my alternative options?

We can hope that the [plastic eating bacteria](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6278/1196) becomes commercially viable pretty quickly **OR** we can look at other options of plastic and reduce our dependency on them.

**Option 1 – Stop using plastic**

&amp;#x200B;

* Wooden Toys – Well these are great and a favourite of ours, but they are just so expensive.
* Metal toys – Other than Mechano metal doesn’t really suit the mould  for a modern toy. It is hard, cold and just a bit brash without a lovely  plastic paint coat.

**Option 2 – Switch to better plastic**

&amp;#x200B;

* Recycled plastic
* Bio degradable plastic or Bio-Plastic

### Bio-plastic – the reason why we should keep using plastic

&gt;Bio-plastics currently come in two forms, plant based and petroleum based.  
 

**Petroleum based bio-plastic**

Is [processed by](http://www.ensoplastics.com/FAQ/FAQ-Alternative-Plastics.html)  adding metals of cobalt, magnesium and nickel and sounds horrible (It’s  not something we are keen on either) that sound like a lot of rare  earth just to detoxify something that didn’t need to be created in the  first place.

**Plant based bio-plastic**

Is made from a substance called PLA or Poly Lactic Acid. This is  compostable in the right conditions, namely, a very specific heat. If  sent to a commercial compost facility, it it will break up and turn into  natural enzymes in about [3 months.](https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/how-long-does-it-take-for-plastics-to-biodegrade.htm])

Throwing it out on your compost heap may mean it takes a [lot longer](https://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/how-long-does-it-take-for-plastics-to-biodegrade1.htm]) and throwing it out in the rubbish may mean it won’t breakdown at all. but WOW, what a product.

### Where can I find these bio-plastic toys?

It is not that easy but this is one area that is becoming much  easier. A Large number of companies and corporations are spending  millions on plant based plastic research. In the toy industry, [LEGO](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-tries-to-build-a-better-brick-1436734774)  who are renowned for their reliance on plastic parts are leading the  way and have just started their roll out of plant based plastic bricks  derived from [sugar cane](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus/news-room/2018/march/pfp/). Over time this is going to become standard, which, as slight LEGO enthusiasts,  we welcome with open arms.

Of course we couldn’t spend out time here and not mention our [own rang of bio plastic toys](https://www.clarestoys.com/product-category/bio-plastic/) from Bioserie.",environment,1569270421,rerium,0,2,True,2019-09-23 16:27:01

Read if haven't watched: Greta Thunberg's full speech from the UN climate summit," 

As I'm sure most of us know, Greta Thunberg spoke at the UN climate summit in New York yesterday. Here is a full transcript of what she said:

&gt;This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees \[Celsius\], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us — we who have to live with the consequences.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees global temperature rise – the best odds given by the \[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\] – the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan. 1st, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years.  
There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.

Why are we not discussing the per-calorie emission cost of food production?,"I was recently looking at some data about agg emissions and I came across [this UVM article about energy use in agriculture](https://learn.uvm.edu/foodsystemsblog/2014/07/10/meat-vs-veg-an-energy-perspective/) and when you look at the energy cost of producing/packing/distributing/etc meat OR plant based agg, there isn't a whole lot of difference between them.

 &gt;The energy intensity of fruit and vegetables in the US might surprise some, but it shouldn’t; modern fruit and vegetable farming systems are highly industrialized, relying on vast monocultures, fertilizers, pesticides, and tillage practices that require heavy machinery and plenty of fuel. While grain is less energy intensive than other foods, it is relatively devoid of easily absorbed nutrients and provides little more than empty calories. At the national level, there appears to be little meaningful difference between the energy intensity of animal-derived foods relative to fruits and vegetables.

This really got me thinking: why the hell are we not discussing the per-calorie ""cost"" of the food we eat? 

In theory, food A could be 2x as costly in terms of carbon to produce than food B, but provide 4x the caloric benefit. In this sense, food A would still be our better choice in terms if GHG impact.

Pay Attention to the Saudi-Yemen War,"A couple days ago Yemen's Houthis launched an attack on Saudi Arabia's biggest oil facility, potentially shutting down large parts of its capacity.  Trump's administration is now threatening war with Iran by citing this attack on our favorite tyranny's oil wealth.  However this specific episode plays out, Trump &amp; co's candor about the purpose of US involvement in the middle east should be illustrative of a much larger trend: for the past 3-4 decades, basically as long as climate change has been debated publicly, US foreign policy has been dedicated to protecting oil flows.  The Tanker War of the 80s and Desert Storm in the 90s were explicitly sold to the American people as being about oil; the post-9/11 wars, by contrast, did a good job of stigmatizing any mention of their oil connections.  Say what you will about Trump, but here he isn't bothering with the facade any more, and its long past time the environmental movement articulated the ecological costs of waging permanent wars to defend  emissions.",environment,1568618677,PinkoPrepper,2,13,True,2019-09-16 03:24:37
"Sumatran orangutan charity comes out in support of dam they previously opposed, following threats of deportation etc. of foreign staff","This is the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme which operates in Sumatra as Yayasan Ekosistem Lestari, and which is a subsidiary of Paneco, a Swiss charity.

SOCP until recently opposed the construction of a hydropower dam in Batang Toru, the home of the newly identified Batang Toru/Tapanuli orangutan (this species is geographically separate from the Sumatran orangutan). There are around 900 Tapanuli orangutans in the wild, and none in captivity. The threat posed by the dam is assessed here. https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.33

The dam is a large project and in May the opposition of the SOCP started getting attention.

This article is in Indonesian (try Google translate or something): https://waspadaaceh.com/2019/05/06/langgar-mou-aktifitas-paneco-bisa-dibekukan-dan-staf-wna-dideportasi/

and essentially says that nationalist rhetoric was employed against the foreign staff, describing them as conducting a 'black campaign' and threatening them with deportation.

In August they went to the Dutch and British embassies in Jakarta to complain. http://inilampung.com/2019/08/tokoh-adat-tapsel-menolak-intervensi-lsm-asing (Indonesian language again)

They specifically requested that the British national who has lived in Medan, Sumatra for about 20 years as head of the SOCP, and who has an Indonesian wife &amp; children be deported. 

Very shortly after this PanEco/SOCP deleted all criticism of the dam, and said they now support it.

* https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/dam-threatens-world-s-rarest-ape-why-are-some-conservationists-suddenly-board (English)

Points to note:

* the almost entirely Indonesian-run charity, Orangutan Information Centre, attracted no such nationalistic rhetoric, despite also opposing the dam
* as mentioned above, the British manager of the SOCP, Ian Singleton, is a legal resident of Indonesia through his marriage. He would be able to nationalise as Indonesian, but may not wish to give up his British citizenship.
* the named Dutch staff member has weaker ties to Indonesia and has left the country
* Paneco/SOCP has some projects in Sumatra, namely the Ecolodge hotel in Bukit Lawang (http://ecolodges.id/en/), the Orangutan Haven zoo project (under construction - https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/our-work/creating-new-wild-populations/orangutanhaven/) as well as the Jantho orangutan release site (https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/our-work/creating-new-wild-populations/reintroduction/jantho/) among others

Environmental impact difference between in-store purchase and online purchase,"My wife has been buying soap online and it has got me wondering, what is the environmental impact difference between an online purchase and one in-store. I was thinking the inputs here are in regards to how the product gets from the manufacterer to the end user. Here is what I see is the difference:

In-Store requires drive/public transit/bike/walk to the store to acquire the item.

Online purchases require a carrier to deliver the item to your door. 

However, what I don't know is the difference between the two as it relates to the rest of the supply chain. For instance, how does a bar of soap get to a store vs. how it gets to an Amazon warehouse. Are there extra steps in the supply chain in one or the other? If so, this increases the environmental impact of that single bar of soap.

How do you do this when paying a human to count the Styrofoam is costs too much? How do you measure the volume/weight ratio when the ratio is distorted?

"Environmental movement needs to be objective and scientific, less partisan and more solution oriented","Environmental movement is not just about human environment, it is also the environment of nature.  I think reducing our carbon usage and increasing clean technology is essential for the next century.   This means decreasing human population and not urbanizing rural areas.   There is a trend for environmentalism to be narrow in policy resolutions, but the need is a broad approach.  B. Owens author of half earth made a road map of how we need to reserve half of all the earth and especially key biological regions/areas as natural reserves.  Nature can not protect itself from the wants in desires of people.   Somethings I think should be obvious if this is going to be successfully implemented.  

1. Regions with low population density should not be urbanized, but protected.
2. Critical habits need to be scientifically analyzed and protected.
3. Pollution needs to be reduced.
4. Carbon usage needs to be reduced.
5. That we need to restore forests that were destroyed years ago.
6. Food production should be local and adapted to what is available of region.
7. Harvesting from nature should only be allowed after reserves are formed and a sustainable plan is developed.
8. Production needs to be local.

Looking at these issues, I have concluded some solutions may not be politically acceptable on different spectrum of ideologies.  

A. Reducing Carbon Usage is not supported by those who don't recognize our impact on Climate. 

1. Carbon reduction requires change in technology.
2. Reduction in consumption.
3. Increasing Energy Efficiency

B. Stopping Immigration to countries and regions with lower density populations.

1. Southwest United States has a severe overpopulation and water crisis.  This crisis is partly caused by immigration and migration to this region from other parts of the country.  This needs to be stopped in order to protect ecosystems and natural environment.  There are people fleeing countries because of violence.  A systemic approach of reducing poverty and crime where they currently live is a better approach then relocation.  Many species are endangered of going extinct, we need to look at protecting these species as a priority.

Reducing Foreign Trade and producing locally is not something that is generally planned for in United States.  

2. Currently the import of trade into United States is staggering, the American culture requires a definite adjustment to live a simpler for of living - using technology as a tool for our and natures environment - not a tool for over consumption.

One thing that saddens me in the current political climate is that people can not seem to talk both about the positive and negative aspects of an approach, there seems to be less flexibility in thinking and understanding.  My long range vision is having a healthy environment with half the earth dedicated to nature.

Plastic Bottle Consumption and Recycling," Single-use plastics, or disposable plastics, are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. These items are things like plastic bags, straws, coffee stirrers, soda and water bottles and most food packaging.

Out of all the plastic waste, single use plastic bottles have wreaked a havoc on the planet. Only 20% of single use plastic bottles get recycled while the rest end up in ocean beds or landfills, where these bottles slowly degrade into microplastics. These small particles can enter the human food chain when we eat seafood or drink water contaminated with microplastics. Research is underway examining the impact of microplastics on human health.

If strict measures are not taken right now, the whole planet would be become a wasteland, and it will impact every living organism. Recycling needs to be promoted on a large scale.

Here are some interesting statistics related to worldwide consumption and recycling of single use plastic bottles.

To plant trees and grow a forest,"Firstly my apologies, I know very little about the environment and the issues thereof.

But if it were possible to plant many many trees and grow a forest in an area of the world that needed trees and a forest, what advantages or disadvantages could there be from it?

In my limited knowledge it seems that if people could do such a thing they could at the very least provide a place for kids to play and for families to spend happy days outside. For pet dogs to run around.

I imagine that just by planting trees there could be an abundance of other plants and smaller trees that would grow. And after that a place for animals to make their home.

I think it could just brighten up a small part of the world at the very least.

Are there any disadvantages to this? Is it a foolish thing to do?",environment,1568262256,MinimumMechanic,2,5,True,2019-09-12 00:24:16

Death By Plastic: 1 kg Plastic = 6 kg C0₂,"Petrochemical Use Is Growing 7X Human Population
---
The Internet of Things requires 2 things, petrochemicals and minerals. Somebody has invented self-tying running shoes, which need to be charged. They invented a smart fork, I guess because they kept stabbing themselves in the face with dumb forks. We could make everyone use them to protect the clumsy. There is even something called Smart Garbage.

• The world-wide production of plastic is currently at 35 kilograms per year per person. On average, it is increasing by 3% per year.

• Most of the plastic is used for packaging (35%), followed by the construction sector and vehicle construction.

• About 40% of the produced plastic is being disposed within 1 year (primarily packaging material).

• The average lifetime of plastic is 12 years. The main reason is the relatively long lifetime in the construction sector.

• Recycling of plastic saves on average about 2.5 kg CO2 per kg of plastic. Thus recycled plastic produces about 3.5 kg CO2 compared to 6 kg of CO2 for new plastic (production and incineration).

• In 2016, the world produced 325 million
tonnes of plastic, a figure that is growing by 4% annually.
40% of the plastic we make is used just once. 

• By 2050, the expected production of plastic will have reached
1124 million tonnes. 8–10 million tonnes enter the oceans
annually—by 2050, the total mass of ocean plastic will
exceed that of fish. 

• In 1976, on average, each person used
2 kg of plastic annually. 

• By 2017, that figure had risen to
43 kg. 

• Every minute, human beings use 2 million plastic
bags and 1 million plastic bottles

• But of the total quantifiable marine plastic pollution, only 1% is floating on the sea surface and 5% is washed up on beaches.
The remaining 94% sits on the sea floor.

Is climate change effecting trees in the U.S. midwest?,"I feel stupid asking this.  Maybe this is all just normal stuff.  But I have lived here for 9 years and this is mostly just in the last 1 year.

I live in Southwest Ohio and our summers have been about normal, hot and humid, but lately winters have seemed wetter and warmer.  The suburb I live in was built mostly between 1870-1920 and we have a lot of very large old trees, especially Poplar, Oak, Maple, Elm, and Ash.  We haven't had any particularly close infestations of Emerald Ash Borers that I know of.

But we have lost part or all of at least 6 very large mature trees in the 8 blocks around my house over the past year.  They are coming down in chunks.  A 40 foot long branch fell off of our neighbor's huge old Oak tree a few weeks ago.  It looked and still looks perfectly healthy, just with a gaping scar halfway up. A house by my kids' school had a large tree, not sure of the species, that partially fell into the power lines and the road and had to be taken down.  A 100 plus year old celebrity tree on the local golf course just completely fell apart, like it just collapsed.  Every windy storm will leave branches everywhere, some as think as my arm.  Our own front yard poplar tree had its leaves go brown and fall off mid July, but apparently this is a known issue with hot summers after wet springs.

Why don't liberals/socialists mention care about other natural disasters such as solar flares? Did you know that in 2012 we missed a massive solar storm by about NINE DAYS? If that would have hit the earth we would have experienced trillions in damage and blackouts that would have lasted years.,"\&gt;fight this greatest enemy of humanity

&amp;#x200B;

How has climate change personally affected you negatively? Do you think Alex Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist for ""preaching doom and gloom?""

&amp;#x200B;

Why don't you care about other natural disasters such as solar flares? Did you know that in 2012 we missed a massive solar storm by about NINE DAYS? If that would have hit the earth we would have experienced trillions in damage and blackouts that would have lasted months or even years and tens of millions of people would have died. Why is that never mentioned by democrats that pretend to care about how the environment can negatively affect humans?

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_storm\_of\_2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012)

\&gt;The solar storm of 2012 was an unusually large and strong coronal mass ejection (CME) event that occurred on July 23 that year. It missed the Earth with a margin of approximately nine days

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Had the CME hit the Earth, it is likely that it would have inflicted serious damage to electronic systems on a global scale.\[2\] A 2013 study estimated that the economic cost to the United States would have been between $0.6 and US$2.6 trillion.\[3\] Ying D. Liu, professor at China's State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, estimated that the recovery time from such a disaster would have been about four to ten years

&amp;#x200B;

How come liberals/socialists only propose giving government more power and making energy more expensive as a solution to these problems? Why aren't space based solutions ever proposed that could also defend us from solar storms?

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us know someone who has been a victim of the war on drugs or the war on terror (my friend had his family killed in Iraq for example) yet you claim that climate change is the thing we should be more afraid of than government authoritarian violence? You are more likely to be imprisoned for a nonviolent offense or falsely imprisoned than you are to be a victim of murder or rape (about 1 in 150 vs 1 in 300 respectively.) So it's reasonable to be more afraid of increasing government power than climate change.

Proper Utilization of Fly Ash Can Save our Environment,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Fly Ash](https://i.redd.it/l3ps1enb1bm31.jpg)

We all know that the fly ash is a by-product of coal combustion in electric generation power plants, which poses a wide range of environmental challenges. Since industrialization is at its pace all across the region, fly ash is becoming unavoidable. That is why it is more than important to reduce fly ash in order to minimize its impact on environment as well as human well-being. In other words, efficient and sustainable efforts are needed to reduce the overall pollution.

&amp;#x200B;

***Fact –***

***According to latest Central Electricity Authority (CEA) data available for 2016-17, almost 169 million tonnes (mt) of fly ash was generated by thermal power plants (TPPs) in India.***

&amp;#x200B;

However, one of the most interesting things is that fly ash can be used as key material in many types of cement-based products, including poured concrete, concrete block, and brick.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Types of Fly Ash -**   

&amp;#x200B;

|  **Class F fly ash**|  **Class C fly ash**|
|:-|:-|
|The burning of harder, older anthracite and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. |It is produced from the burning of younger lignite or sub-bituminous coal.|

 

So, the question is how to reduce carbon footprint and make prudent use of fly ash? The answer is proper utilization of advanced technology, government and private sector initiatives. Also there is a need of newer guidelines, marketing campaigns, workshops, awareness campaigns, conferences as well as focused initiatives. Besides that, it is also important to promote ash utilization, spread awareness and product (products produced from fly ash) promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Utilization**

According to a report, cement and brick industry can use fly ash in multiple ways to develop its products. In other words, they can use the fly ash to produce concrete slabs, bricks and poured concrete. Beyond that there are many industries that can use fly ash.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Properties of Fly ash**

Since it is tough, efficient, durable, and robust, it can also be used in road construction, structural fills, railway sleepers, and much more. In other words, it has become a reliable source for end-use industries.  

A wide range of studies and researches are also underway to discover new opportunities and avenues for the proper utilization of fly ash. In essence, it is possible to reduce carbon footprint by the systematic utilization of fly ash. All we need is to take appropriate steps to achieve our goals.",environment,1568356083,vcare4environment,5,1,True,2019-09-13 02:28:03

Looking for help with my “going green” plan,"Hey all I'm trying to become more environmentally friendly and I thought I would post my current strategy. I'm definitely looking for constructive criticism so please let me know if you disagree with anything I say.

I'm starting this from the (possibly controversial) premises that:
* My personal contribution won't make a tangible difference without trying to encourage wider change (but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t try)
* Going green should be judge free and I shouldn't hold others to my personal standards (and vice versa)
* Avoid aggressive activism
* I shouldn't have to go over the top, everything must be fair and easy to do.
* If something isn't easy to do I should focus on fixing that instead of just punishing myself 

I've split what I can do into three parts:

Personal:

1. Reduce red meat consumption
2. Cycle to work instead of taking public transport
3. Buy attachment for fridge to slow down fruit and veg going off
4. Swap to green electric and gas supplier
5. Look for good quality second hand furniture/white goods/cars instead of buying new
6. Reduce buying clothes to less but longer lasting pieces
7. Avoid buying large electronics unless second hand or I really need them
8. Double check how environmentally friendly the major companies I use are
9. Try to eat out less
10. Try and document what I throw out and don’t recycle to see how to rectify it in the future
11. Contacted my water company and received a replacement piece for my tap to reduce water usage
12. Placed a timer in my shower to try to reduce my shower time
13. Roughly calculate my carbon footprint and donate to causes that offset my carbon footprint (estimated at £5 a month but I'll probably try and pay more if I can)

Government/charity:

1. Identify green charities (that focus on advocacy) to donate to. Am currently thinking:
    * WWF
    * UN projects
2. Write to my local politicians and the local council asking for their positions and impressing mine
3. Write to my favorite companies asking them the same

Investments:

1. Move long term savings into ethical funds. Vanguard has one for the European market I'm going to use for the moment
2. Try to identify some interesting environmental start ups that are crowd funding and I can invest in

Energy Consumption in the U.S.,"Did you know: \~40% of our country's energy is consumed by buildings/homes? It takes a TON of energy to heat, cool, and power the spaces we inhabit. We NEED to reduce this statistic if we are to have a sustainable future, and it must begin with a radical revamping of modern construction practices.

 Luckily, there are things we can do to reduce this statistic AND improve our quality of life--all at a competitive price.

When you decide to build, consider sustainable strategies such as Net Zero design, Passive design, The Living Building Challenge, LEED, and more. These strategies focus on increasing a building's efficiency and reducing the need for electricity. The result--less energy consumption. 

What's more, sustainable design ALWAYS promotes healthy living practices. Building occupants are forced to participate in operating the building, learning about sustainable practices that will spill over into other aspects of life. People are more likely to bike to work, take the stairs, or get outside and develop a sense of community. Simply put, building green creates the opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle.

 So let us live our best life. Let us inspire our children with the places we inhabit. Let us move toward a better future, a more sustainable future.

40% is far too high.

Looking for advice on how to reduce waste at my place where I host pickup basketball.,"Hey all, I hope this post fits this sub.

Basically I host pickup basketball for friends/family/anyone else who wants to join about 2-3 times a week and every time they come I provide plastic water bottles. I was wondering if there is an alternative to this which would reduce overall waste while still having enough water for everyone.

I was thinking about something like (https://imgur.com/a/P4fDbrh)

However that would require me to fill it with water and put ice in it every time which is more work than I want to do.

If anyone has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated.

Is being began really that green?,"I generally support environmental efforts, especially in emissions control and low/no emission energy generation. However, a a friend of mine staunchly defend veganism and mentioned that it is greener than eating red meat. Cows produce methane and CO2. To eat red meat we need to maintain a stock level and transport it to be processed and sold. Here is what I was thinking as a devils advocate supposing we did suddenly stop eating red.

If we ate just plants to meet our nutritional needs, would we like current vegans fart more?

Wouldn’t the now safe unslaughtered cows still produce the same amount of methane?

Wouldn’t the agricultural process for plants require lots of fertilizer (organic or not) which would either produce methane and CO2 as it decomposes?

And as far as everyones poo... Wouldn’t the undigested fiber of everyones high plant diet have to be pooed out, ferment in a bio reactor at a water plant only to be sent to compost and drying beds also producing green house gas?

What about the highly nitrogenous waste discharge water? Wouldn’t that find it’s way to water ways causing toxic algae blooms in an already stressed and overfished warming ocean?

Those were all my concerns. This is something that I would want to see a peer reviewed study on. The problem is I have not found any put together this way. I have found truth to all of those questions, but nothing that compares sum total emissions. This seems to be a common problem, like calculating the carbon emissions to build a nuclear powerplant, solar panel, or wind turbine. luckily these energy sources do pan out in the long run now that studies asked those questions. Eating vegan, I do it out of enjoyment from time to time (not as a full time diet), I have nothing against it, but, just some things I have not yet seen anyone ask.

I made a video on how anyone can help to save the planet,"[The Video](https://youtu.be/TXvmBG-A4Dw)

Today I made a very important video for me. Recently scientist have said that we have less than 12 years before the effects of global warming are no longer reversable. This means that we have to get information out on how people can help or contribute to save the planet.

I know that it can be hard to implement new things into an everyday life, that could potentially change the way you do things. For example eating less meat is very important to not lose the stability in earth's animal life. But at the same time, you eat what you are used to eating. This is why it is so hard to implement thjings like this in your everyday life.

Luckily in this video I provide you with ways you can help save the planet that don't take long time and you do help massively. This is why it is important to spread this type of information, so if 100 people do these things, the world will completely change.

I hope you now see why this is important for me. As one of the newer generations, I would like to live on a healthy and stable planet. I would rather travel 40 years to the next best planet then live in the literal hell that would be earth.

I think Trump or Biden would be worst case scenario and Warren would be best case. 

This is vital in this election because The elections will effect how climate change is fought and if it will be fought in time so we have to think who we’re voting for 

A vote for a bad candidate eats up 4 years of out 10 year deadline at best and 8 at worst. Even if that candidate does only last a term it’s likely a republican will get elected who doesn’t care about climate. That leaves us best case 2 years left and worst case -2 years left. 

We need to vote for candidates that have promised climate action, have policy and have a climate action track record

Brazilian Amazon on fire: a rundown of what happened so far,"First of all: I read on this sub a lot but don't post often - if my post violates the rules I apologise to the mods - feel free to chuck me out.

**This includes:**

*Why the forest is on fire, how France and Brazil got into a big argument over it, why the biggest global sources of fires are technically in Africa but we should still keep focusing on South America, and how we as everyday citizens can help support to Amazon.*

I would love to have feedback from all you environmental enthusiasts (professional or not) if I can do anything better in my videos and what your opinions are.

**This is NOT a post to fish for engagement.** I spent the last 10 years in Academia only but it's time we scientists stepped out of our bubble and engaged with the real world to spread real information and help create change. Not once did I have a single class on communication, video production etc. but I believe **as scientists we need these skills today to surpass the big news/governmental channels and reach the public directly.**

I am so happy about this sub, so if anybody wants to help me (and my fellow scientist friends) with feedback on the video, content, what I can improve I greatly appreciate it. If you don't want to leave a comment on the video or on this post, shoot me a PM. Any help is appreciated.

There are *multiple* reasons to be upset, but one point I want to discuss is the park's reasoning for the selection:

I don't understand why the bull couldn't have been separated instead of put up as a trophy under this permit system. I understand that any one of the rhinos would have had to be killed and there was a certain allotment of permits that allows the horrible act to be put in place in the name of 'diplomacy' or 'conservation', but it just seems like a terrible practice to kill a 29 year old bull on one of the grounds of it harming its own population growth.",environment,1568053030,WilliamGoodwin33,1,7,True,2019-09-09 14:17:10

5G = No Bees No Trees No Kids,"Never before have so many humans been so cleverly induced to slowly exterminate themselves. We are exposing ourselves to radiation that will wipe out our own species.

If you are 20 years old, you spent your whole life cell zapped by radiation.

The damage to your cells is cumulative, irreversible, causes sterility, mental illness and damages offspring. This radiation kills on the cellular level in all plants and insects. It kills bees and trees. Nothing is immune, it's irreversible and it adds up to make you sick and will destroy your offspring.

This radiation causes cumulative irreversible brain leaks that will make you and your children sick and stupid. The radiation also damage the stem cells which you need to get old. The radiation causes irreversible cognitive impairment, and will only get worse going forward. 

The cell phone safety studies are complete bullshit. The evidence is over fucking whelming. This is not a conspiracy theory, it's a conspiracy for real. We are conspiring to collapse our own species and all life on earth because of our lust and greed.

This radiation combined with blue video light screws with your melatonin, which you need to stop from going crazy. Nano particles cause brain blood leaks. Magnetic nano particles from combustion go up your nose straight to you brain. Plastic and mineral nano particles in the air eat at your brain and organs. Micro plastics chemicals and metals are in our air food water fabrics and materials.

I think human driven climate change might be a fraud. please set me straight.,"I have a slight scientific background. I am in school for engineering, I have taken low level environmental classes and I have read and watched lectures from people on the topic. Recently I have encountered some very persuasive lectures that convincingly counter the CO2 hypothesis. I am hoping someone can correct me because I do not want to be a conspiracy person or someone who has wrongly become a climate hoax believer. Here are some of the data they present that is difficult to account for. 

1) the most extensive ice core study humans have done shows that temperature rise precedes CO2 increases. 

2) if you look at temperature variation from 10k years and before that you will see fluctuations in temperature of 18 degrees F. This is FAR beyond what we are to being told is catastrophic. 

3) CO2 levels are on low side in terms of Earths history. The graphs Ive seen show that CO2 used to be closer to 1000ppm. we are currently in the 400ppm level. 

4) Solar cycles or cloud formation could completely change our hypothesis but do not have accurate models of these phenomena. 

5) we don't have anywhere near a complete understanding of climate. Climate is EXTREMELY complicated and our best nerds at MIT cant even model clouds let alone global climate changes. yet we are supposed to believe they are certain CO2 is the cause of warming 

6) the ""97% of scientist agree humans are cause global warming"" claim was done with some tricky statistics. they looked at roughly 12,000 journal article abstracts. of those abstracts  \~30% wrote about human causes of global warming. of that 30%, 97% claimed human caused global warming. that means 60% of those articles did not mention anything. its a fairly political statistic that misleads most people.(why the need to mislead?)

I genuinely hope to be set straight and I hope to god people have answers and I have been listening to quacks. I don't want to be a hoaxer. I don't want to believe I am being lied to. someone set me straight.",environment,1567305275,opinion192,65,0,True,2019-08-31 22:34:35

If there is one thing I've learnt about architectures of software systems, it is to never rely on a one single central entity, a single point of failure that weakens the whole system. If it is brought down the whole system is brought down. Our single point of failure here is the Amazon forest.

"All this spreading awareness to save the earth is great and all, and to make a change. But if I’m being honest, I think it’s too late for us now..","There are plenty of amazing people out there making change, though not enough of us are. And if you looked at even just this years events, it’s crazy to think we got this far without making a proper impact to benefit this earth that we’re living in. And frankly, most of us can’t bother because they think they won’t live long enough to experience these future catastrophic environmental changes, and in this situation, that’s not the case as these changes and indications of climate change are coming at us faster than we can ever cope and deal with. Out of all the things in this world right now, the most important thing we would have had to prioritize is this place, earth, our only true home. There’s no point in hoping to have a breakthrough in space exploration because if we don’t do enough to help save earth, we’ll be gone before it happens. Not enough influential people such as our leaders are even on board with any of the negative changes that is happening to our world as too many of them, including us are too fixated in economy, rivalry, and everything else apart from the sole environment we stand on. The fastest rates of environmental change recorded is in our current stage. We as a human race, the smartest living beings on earth were the only hope in restoring our home, yet we are the ones that caused the destruction of it. Because of our greed, and selfishness. Now again, I don’t think we can reverse most of what we’ve done to revive this planet, if so, it’s very slim. And if this is how we die as a society, we have to live with it. We deserve to be ended by our own choices as a whole. And if everything else is able to thrive again, then I hope it doesn’t get to this point.

So i have this plot of land and i'd like to plant a small forest,"We own a plot in the Romanian SW Carpathians in the Semenic National Park area, the altitude is about 800-900 meters. The plot is about 2800 square meters. It's on both sides of a small valley, with a little stream running through it. There are a few trees, other than that about 1/2 is well kept grass, about an 1/8th is slightly swamped and the rest  is very very dense grass(as in you need a freaking tractor to cut it down). Both sides have an incline of about 5-10 degrees.

The area naturally has  large beech forests and fir forests. Birch flourish there too.

The plan would be to create a forest, a forest to fight climate change and deforestation. I could just head out into the countryside and excavate some trees and replant them, but i feel like just moving trees around is besides the point. I'd like to grow them from the seed up. I'd like to make the forest look natural, not perfectly lined up. This will take decades, since everything seems to grow slower there. 

Does anyone have any tips about reforestation, websites that can help? I've participated in some reforestation events and they used to plant some bushes next to the actual seedling, so that the bush creates a shadow and stimulates the seedling to grow faster.

Once any of these 3 tipping points are triggered, then that event becomes unstoppable and irreversible, and then proceeds to trigger the other two. We are already deep into mass extinction, and there's nothing we can do to stop it, period. The very best we can even hope to do is to slow it down.

Did you ever see a scientist go out of a limb? Of course not, if he did, there would be 3 other scientists cutting that limb to take him out.  Scientists are trained to be reticent about alarmism, and are no different than media personalities -- if they don't tow the line, their ass is grass. But being alarmist is essential now. The time for cowardice is gone.

The only thing that can destroy this planet faster than us is an asteroid about the size of Greenland, or multiple hydrogen bombs. Did you know cement use tripled in the last 20 years, and it's set to double again by 2050? Did you know 4 billion flights are had each year, and we expect 8 billion flights per year by 2050? Did you know that we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid runaway hothouse climate chaos? 

Drought, starvation, war, famine and mass poisoning are spearheading these 3 major tipping points, and each are bad enough, in of themselves. They act like the thin edge of the wedge that forms the sharp point that pricks the balloon of life on earth. The recovery of phyto- and zoo- planktons will takes several millions of years.

**The world is deep into the sixth mass extinction event, and may be “too late” to change.**

- At least a million species are now in serious decline or facing extinction. 

**The next mass extinction event is already underway**

- Population sizes of vertebrate species have, on average, dropped by more than half in 40 years,"" while human population has nearly doubled from about four billion to 7.3 billion.

**Plants are going extinct up to 350 times faster than the historical norm**

https://qz.com/africa/1694276/plants-are-going-extinct-350-times-faster-than-normal/

- If we were to condense the Earth’s 4.5-billion-year-old history into one calendar year, then life evolved somewhere in June, dinosaurs appeared somewhere around Christmas, and the Anthropocene starts within the last millisecond of New Year’s Eve. Modern plant extinction rates that exceed historical rates by hundreds of times over such a brief period will spell disaster for our planet’s future.

**Climate change is killing off Earth’s little creatures**

Our Planet: Our Business.,"I recently watched the following video posted by WWF and thought its important to share it with everyone.

[Our Planet: Our Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdWQJq2OkJs)

  Some hard-hitting facts from the video:

* Right now, we are in the midst of the Earth's sixth mass extinction. One every bit as profound and far-reaching as that which wiped out the dinosaurs.
* In the last fifty years, the number of people on Earth has more than doubled.
* Just over the past fifty years, we have embarked on an exponential rise of unsustainable exploitation of resources, unsustainable pressures on the planet, which has now reached such magnitude that science concludes that we have become our own geological epoch.
* Welcome to the Anthropocene - The Age of Humans. We are now the dominant force of change on the planet. Three quarters of the land surface and two thirds of the ocean are impacted by our activities.
* Our poles are losing their ice. In the summer, there is forty percent less Arctic sea ice cover than there was in 1980.
* Many of the world's great rivers and lakes are drying up. Lake Chad, fifty years ago, it was twenty-five thousand kilometres square of water. And now, 90% of the water has just evaporated.
* Almost half of our planet's forests have been felled for their timber, and to make space for ourselves and our livestock. About 60% of global deforestation of the tropical forests of the planet is to produce beef. About 30% is to produce crops.
* Mangroves, full of colour and life, are being cleared to make way for shrimp farms and beach resorts.
* At sea, our extensive over-fishing is leading to the collapse of key fish stocks. We have already lost ninety percent of large oceanic predators, like tuna, sharks and swordfish.
* We have replaced the wild with the domestic. We and the animals we raise to eat make up ninety-six percent of the weight of mammals on Earth. Just four percent is made up of wildlife.
* Half of the fertile land on the planet is now farm land.
* Our takeover of the natural world has been so successful, that in the last fifty years, populations of wild animals have declined on average by sixty percent.
* As the planet warms, weather systems are becoming less predictable. Deadly storms, fires and floods are all becoming more frequent and more severe.
* Over ninety percent of people on the planet breathe dangerously polluted air.
* The services that biodiversity provides for us are estimated to be worth twice as much as the entire globe's GDP. The destruction of our natural world is already costing us trillions of dollars every year. Suddenly, the costs of the Age of Humans are outweighing the benefits.
* We are at risk of entering a danger zone where we could trigger irreversible and self-amplifying change which could push the whole planet ultimately away from the desired equilibrium.
* If we continue with Business As Usual, scientists predict that a baby born today could barely be in her twenties by the time the soils of the frozen north thaw, releasing their locked methane, and any chance of controlling the climate is lost. She could be in her thirties when the last of the coral reefs collapse as a result of ocean acidification and warming. By the time she is sixty, overuse of fertilisers and pesticides could have killed off soil microorganisms and pollinating insects. There would be no more fertile soil. The weather becomes increasingly unpredictable, leading to a global food crisis. Supply chains in multiple sectors may have broken down. As she reaches her eighties, our planet could be four degrees warmer. She may have lived through the extinction of countless species. Large parts of the Earth may be uninhabitable. And global peace, an impossibility. The cost of dealing with this future, if even possible, is estimated to be over five hundred and fifty trillion dollars. Almost double the entire wealth in the world today.
* The Anthropocene has both a negative and a positive side. Thanks to the fact that we are now so clever and so dominant, we can use our own intelligence and our technologies to become positive Anthropocene engineers, Anthropocene stewards. So it's up to us. We are in the driving seat, determining the future for the whole planet.
* We have just ten years to drastically alter our path before it will be too late to avoid catastrophic changes to our planet.",environment,1567445320,zero_emission,0,2,True,2019-09-02 13:28:40

IMF estimated in 2015 that Fossil Fuel Energy is subsidized with 5.3 trillion USD,"  

[https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sonew070215a](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sonew070215a)

Old, but still very relevant. In 2015 the International Monetary Fund published a report on subsidies too fossil fuels. They estimated that fossil fuels receive 5.3 trillion dollars in subsidies, or 6.5 % of world GDP.  

How is this even possible? “Only” 490 billion dollars are direct subsidies, the rest are so called externalities. For those unfamiliar with externalities, here is an example:

You can’t have a music festival in your backyard. Even if you, the musicians and the attendees agree on a price. Why? Because your neighbours are not getting compensated or even agree to the noise and other damages.  
 The same applies to fossil fuels. When you burn coal (or natural gas, petroleum etc.) there are a lot of pollutants that have a wide number of effects, for example health damages and damages due to global warming.  IMF tried to estimate the price of these effects, but be aware, these numbers are uncertain. 

So, what are these externalities

*  Global warming - 1,268 Bn
* Local pollution – 2,734 Bn
* Congestion – 359 Bn 
* Accidents – 271 Bn
* Road damage – 24 Bn

Coal is the king here, receiving 3.14 Trillion of the 5.30 trillion dollars. This is mostly because it is extremely damaging to local air quality, causing diseases and early death.

Sure, some of these externalities seam a bit strange like congestion, because this would happen with electric cars to. 

So, we have an economic system where you don’t have to pay for the damages of fossil fuels. We have made coal, petroleum and gas artificially cheap. The least we can expect is that we must pay the REAL price for the energy we use. 

If someone tries to say that renewable energies only work when subsidized, well this is true for fossil to. Especially some of the more extreme forms like tar sand.  

A 2010 study by Global Subsidies Initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources. Results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 US cents per kWh of energy they produce (the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-OECD countries), nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents / kWh, renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) receives 5.0 cents / kWh and bio-fuels receive 5.1 cents / kWh in subsidies. But 0.8 US cents are only a tiny part of the real subsides. If we assume that this is only 10 % of the real subsidies then fossil fuels are up to 8.0 US cents per kWh, which is more than renewable! Take this conclusion with a bucket of salt, I have not found any similar studies for externalities for renewable. But these forms of energy pollute much less, so one would assume that the externalities are way less than fossil. These two studies are also 5 years apart, and thigs can change a lot.     

[https://iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative\_energy\_subsidies.pdf](https://iisd.org/gsi/sites/default/files/relative_energy_subsidies.pdf)

TL;dr fossil fuels are heavy subsidies because they do not pay for the negative effects on local and global environment. We should have a broader understanding of what subsidies are to encompasse damages to health and the enviromente.",environment,1567504336,AndreJulius1,0,7,True,2019-09-03 05:52:16
Invest For Green Future of Kids and Planet - Plant a Tree! @42 INR/Tree (@0.59 $/Tree),"# - [CauveryCalling](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling) - RallyForRivers Movement - To Save Rivers of India -

The initiative is to covert the paddy cultivated Cauvery River Basin to agroforestry farming.This will provide enough green shade and catchment in basin area which is crucial for replenishing the river water level and also avoid severe floods ,which is a direct effect of it.

**The Business side :** augment farmer income through agroforestry, proven to multiply **farmers’ incomes 3-8 times in 5-7 years.**

**The Ecological side**: Revives the river and groundwater levels by increasing water retention in **Cauvery River basin by an estimated 40%.**

Hence **as investor** , you can support these farmers to ge through the transition by sponsoring trees at a **cost of 42 INR/ tree (@0.59 $/Tree)** . For full disclosure , the total cost of planting one tree is 50 INR/tree but rest 8 INR/tree will be incurred by the farmer as to affirm his commitment to this project.

Cauvery Calling Campaign will support farmers to plant **242 Cr (2.42 Billion) trees** to revitalize Cauvery River Basin.

The company (local farmers) is burning the forest down to raise cattle and grow feed crops to fatten farmed animals for food. The best thing to do is to not support them by buying animal products which they supply feed for the world. The best thing is (by going vegan) by doing so you are saving 20 pounds of CO2, 1,100 gal of water, 45 pounds of grain per day. With of course the added benefits of saving indigenous land, endangered species, and 1 animal a day from the slaughterhouse.

Five countries that generate electricity without fossil fuels - all of them use hydro and 3/5 use nuclear,"I parsed electricity generation data from 2018 to figure out which countries/regions are the most efficient at generating electricity without fossil fuels. It turns out that only five countries generate more than 90% of their electricity from non-fossil sources: Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and France. I thought it would be interesting to know how they do it. It turns out that all of them use significant amounts of hydropower. Three out of the five also use significant amounts of nuclear power. The exceptions are Iceland, which instead uses a lot of geothermal energy, and Norway, which relies almost completely on hydropower.

Unfortunately in the source data some countries are grouped together as a region. Crucially this is the case for ""Other South America"" which as a region generates 88% of its electricity from non-fossil sources. This region includes countries such as Paraguay which, if counted separately, would also make the top list of countries that generate more than 90% of their electricity from non-fossil fuels. The region as a whole principally relies on hydropower.

How do you think global warming / climate change / earth changes / whatever will impact YOU / your area? Within 15 years...,"Forget about other countries, continents, states, and regions. Heck, you might even want to forget about other counties. Forget about the big media stories - Amazon and Siberian rain forests for example (unless you live there or have some sort of measurable impact from there that you can expressly quantify).  

Forget about animal extinction / coral bleaching - unless you work in tourism for example or your economy is supported by tourist dollars. Or you fish for a living and it is affected by damaged coral nurseries in your area.

Yes, everything is connected and there are chain reactions...but ...the purpose of this thread is to talk about how you think you, neighbors, your immediate area, and work environment, will be affected by the changes going on - keeping it localized as much as possible. If you wish to conjecture, fine.  No thought is too outlandish. If you want to give a short recent history - that's great. Weblinks are nice if you can make the extra effort.

If you know about something in an area that somebody is already covering but that isn't listed...please comment and add.

I'll go first...

\---

I live in the **Seattle-area of the Pacific Northwest, USA**.  The **Puget Sound.** The Northerly latitude and wealth of area means realistically, there hasn't been too much day to day life change here. There haven't been any flash flood nor significant hail events (Did notice a tiny amount one day - very very small pellets). No hurricanes here either, of course. With that said...

**2017 and 2018** \- Was a wake up call for this region. Forest fire smoke from British Columbia - Canada, California, Oregon, and within Washington State combined to create toxic air in most of August, and part of September for 2 years in a row.  Summers are semi-precious in this area, so it was a body blow for those who enjoy the outdoors / summer sun.

2017 - [https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ash-falls-like-snow-in-seattle-as-wildfires-rage/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ash-falls-like-snow-in-seattle-as-wildfires-rage/)

2018 - [https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/8/21/17761908/seattle-air-quality-haze-smoke-wildfire-health](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/8/21/17761908/seattle-air-quality-haze-smoke-wildfire-health)

**2019** \- While this past August / September has not been like 2017 nor 2018...it has been different.

Replacing forest fire smoke was more cloudiness and rain in late June / July, and August has been different too - more early clouds - lingering the whole day in August on some days, though not as much as July. Not everyone notices - due to working indoors, not paying attention, short term memory, etc...

Mid-July news report - [https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/july-has-been-cloudier-and-rainier-than-average-but-summer-sun-is-on-the-way/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/july-has-been-cloudier-and-rainier-than-average-but-summer-sun-is-on-the-way/)

What has been different this July versus the last  5 years in July? One of the big differences is the amount cloud cover.  Here is the average sunrise to sunset cloud cover in Seattle for the  last 6 years in July.

2019 **79% - abnormal. 20% increase over 2016 high! That's huge! But not everyone notices!**   
2018 36% - ""anomaly""  
2017 36% - ""anomaly""  
2016 59% - more normal  
2015 46% - more normal  
2014 44% - more normal

Not snowy relative to Mid-West, but for Seattle it was notable.

**The future - 15 years:**

**-** Bark beetle will make major in-roads to PNW forests. The system is already becoming imbalanced...though not anywhere as bad as California.

2018 - [https://q13fox.com/2018/08/08/bark-beetles-attacking-drought-stressed-douglas-fir-trees-across-washington/](https://q13fox.com/2018/08/08/bark-beetles-attacking-drought-stressed-douglas-fir-trees-across-washington/)

Nice **Forest Service Story map** \- can see bark beetle affecting interior California heavily. There are dedicated pages for that...lots of articles / websites for dead trees in California.  Looks like Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington (Hotter and drier) are getting affected more...but haven't found an article / video for those places - nor have I visited.

[https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE\_DOCUMENTS/fseprd573081.html](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd573081.html)

This will cause more forest fires - hence, more forest smoke in Seattle area (Western Washington)

\- **#1 issue will be food shortage.** As drought / floods / cold snaps / wild weather affects places where Seattle-area food comes from.

These charts (crudely) show how reliant US States are for imports from other states.

[http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2017/11/1/how-much-does-your-state-rely-on-other-states-for-food](http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2017/11/1/how-much-does-your-state-rely-on-other-states-for-food)

In the grocery stores here are imported foods from other areas of the world. Rice from Thailand and California. Beef and cheese from middle America and New Zealand. Of course, vegetables from California. Just what comes off the top of my head. And since interior California will get much warmer, and with groundwater running lower.... Also, all the products made from corn (junk food / soda) - and those corn producing states are having issues. Whether it be flood / drought / cold snaps. Olive oil is imported from Spain / Italy - those folks are having problems. Seattle is a coffee capital...those areas are having issues...

Canned vegetable shortage already at Walmart / Kroger / etc... in the news. What's next?

[https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/europe/italy-extreme-weather-olive-oil-harvest-scli-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/europe/italy-extreme-weather-olive-oil-harvest-scli-intl/index.html)

Australia - usually a wheat exporter - is now wheat importer...last year anyway.

**#2 issue (could be #1, probably #1) will be a killer flu. Worse than Spanish Flu of 1918?  -** granted  this doesn't appear to be climate related, but it is. But that's another story I don't want to expand on at this moment. But if you pay attention to the rise of various diseases thought squashed (measles being just one), Bird Flu - which is going on big time, but just doesn't get reported well, and now Swine Fever....100 million dead pigs in China alone...that's just the official # - in 1 year - you might realize something else is going on....

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 issue - possibly water restrictions / (seasonal) water shortage.** Don't have exact figures for Seattle water supplies (Cedar / Tolt) at the moment - but I do have a link to reservoirs of a place I went camping recently...and noticed seriously low water levels. Lake Cle Elum. Less snow pack, lower water levels.

[https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hydromet/yakima/yaktea.html](https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hydromet/yakima/yaktea.html)

**#4 issue - possibly more landslides / sinkholes**

While this occurred in 2014...landslides / sinkholes are happening / opening up all over the world. (See resources link in the beginning). Whether they will start happening more in the Seattle-area...that remains to be seen. (See Earthquakes below) 

[https://www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/](https://www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/)

**#5 issue - Meteor / fireballs** \- a la Chelyabinsk....shock waves causing damage. Go to American Meteor Society to learn more.

**#6 issue - Earthquakes**

if climate change is such a big deal why dont activists target 'x pollution'?,"first of all let me be pblunt and short.

1)climate change isnt going to stop suddenly.

2) why not target air pollution, water pollution etc this sounds much better and everyone can agree on it.

3)people fear that in order to save climate we have to pay additional taxes hence the consipracies. which is plausible considering western countries wont be affected much.

4)why no activism in eastern countries which are going to affected the most. 

5)if people are blaming outsourcing for poor country pollution. what would happen if it is reversed. isnt india already polluting environment without being much of western countries 'slave worker'?

6) how does raising taxes help the environment? also i read many reports and in books that co2 isnt contributor to  global warming other toxic gases are so whats the big problem with it if everything is getting efficienter.

7)if raising living standard increases carbon footprint then china and india are going to severly mess up the environment.

Imo climate activism is overblown and highly exaggerated atleast in western countries because tgings run efficiently there. If climate change has to be prevente please consider activism in china and other countries for norms and regulations.

i live in india. here heavy vehicles are old there is too much pollution, life standad is increasing so everyone is buying new vehicles,there is increase in water consumption, increase in factory production, increase in chemical release in water. there is no official guideline to check and prevent even if there are people are easily bribed. there are no of  regions   causing cancer to people. 
western style of living has made mass consumers which in turn has ill effects both on society and environment.  i am not saying its bad but there are no strict rules and even if there were most people here are uneducated and to whatever they want.

To all of you mad at people hurting the environment by purchase -- I implore you to rethink your mindset.,"This may fall on deaf ears but I feel as though I need to say this. At the end of the day we are, and always have been, creatures of habit. When something comes down the pipeline we love we see it and have to take part in it because it releases chemicals in the brain we enjoy. Many of you have fixed lifestyles where you live balanced lives, and you think, well why not them? Why don't they eat vegan, or drive eco friendly cars, or go without plastics? What assholes!

Here in lies the problem with our thinking in how it stops at this point. 

Have any of you every had the displeasure of dealing with a drug addict as a friend or even in your family? Addicts are predictable once they fall deep into the world. They care about little more then the next high. That's what endless materialism does to people in this society. It teaches them to marginalize themselves and spend endless ours pursuing a fleeting feeling even at the cost of the world. And I don't expect them to overcome it, just like we don't just expect addicts will as well -- We take them to rehab.

See, the problem isn't these people you can't empathize with and want to hold accountable for the destruction of so much. But we all seem to forget that the dealers pulled them in and kept them coming for more. The dealers do much out of the call to more materialism, and their own addictions, but at a more conscious effort and greater lengths. When the Brazilian government burns down the forest for farm land much of you said, ""We need to stop buying meats!"" That's how we stop this market. But why shouldn't we just stop the people burning down the forest? These people go to every length to design something you get hooked on, and make you think it is morally justifiable, and when we find out they make minor adjustments and wait for the next thing to suck dry so they can get a little more materialism. And they'll keep doing it regardless of how woke and level headed you are. And they will continue to not need to even slither for people who are even less in tune with the world.

The  responsibility needs to be at the source. These people need to be fought. If they aren't they get power. And at the end of the day the only thing that can stop a horrendous philanthropist is people demanding they won't choke in factories, and that the system and that people who take advantage are outed. 

We need to build something they can't take advantage of and retain a fair amount of our freedom. That is is the only way forward. But it's not getting mad at simple people who fell victim to something they had no control over and that was DESIGNED to ensure they can't stop it from influencing them.",environment,1566883688,ToInfinityAndKlingon,1,0,True,2019-08-27 01:28:08

"Is it possible to live a rich, lavish and luxurious life while still being environmental?","I have always cared about the environment and the planet and the animals, and I have always cared about saving money as well.

I am fairly frugal. I try to take public transport and ride my bike. I live with my mother to reduce the construction of new property. I don't travel much. I will never have children.

As such, I save quite a bit and invest it in just about everything eg stocks, property, gold, bonds, and crypto. Mostly now I simply invest in ethical ETFs.

Something I do like though are the finer and more elegant things, eg nice clothes, a nice bike, nice food, and it is not just the functional aspects I like eg the aerodynamics of a bike or how healthy or organic food is, but also the aesthetics. I like to buy nice, expensive clothes with organic vegan fibres. In every purchasing decision, there are aesthetic, functional, and social and environmental considerations considerations.

However, whenever I indulge in these aesthetics or luxury, I feel cautious because I understand consumerism drives environmental degradation. 

My question is is such a lifestyle hyoocritical? Furthermore, if there is an environmentally friendly luxurious lifestyle, what does it look like? I imagine I'd rent in the city in a high-density apartment where I can walk everywhere and have a bike to get me places further away if they are on or near bike trails.

"Ecological myth-buster: ""more cattle in Brazil means more pastures to degrade environment"" WRONG!","This graph from EMBRAPA (""EMpresa BRAsileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria"" or Brazilian Agricultural Research Agency) shows in this video (which I suggest you to set english tranlation) that along time the amount of cattle increased from 150 million to 190 million heads (red), while pastures fell from 215 to 167 million hectares (blue). 

That means in 1990 every cow consumed 1,43 hectares, while in 2018 every cow consumed 0,87 hectares, or 60% less pasture per capita, thanks to technology.

video also shows that 50% Brazilian territory is protected by regulatory laws in such a way rain-forest is untouchable for any purposes, being it agricultural, mineral extraction, roads, railroads or whatever things, and that Brazil uses only 7% of territory to agricultural production, compared to more than 10% in most of industrial countries. 

These protections are because national parks, indigenous lands and many other reasons detailed by EMBRAPA, and so protected land is bigger than entire Europe (Ukraine included). That is, an entire Europe of untouchable forests.

Sustainability labelling for food packaging,"# Sustainability labelling for food packaging

The food we eat not only has an impact on our health, but also the health of our planet. Climate change, water shortages and plastic pollution are just some of the global problems food production contributes to. But when we buy our food, we aren’t given any information about whether a product is bad for the environment or not. [Food packaging in the UK has nutritional information](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-read-food-labels/) printed on it to help consumers make healthier choices. Why not also have sustainability information, so it’s easier to make eco-friendly choices too?

There are many factors that affect how sustainable a food product is, meaning there are a variety of ways you could present this information to consumers. From only focusing on one element; such as a product’s carbon footprint, to a detailed breakdown of every way the environment is affected during a product’s life cycle. To give an idea of how food sustainability labelling might work, here are 3 different designs that could be implemented.

**Please note, the statistics and figures displayed in each design have not been rigorously researched, so should not be considered accurate. They are purely for illustrative purposes.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Product's carbon footprint label

Here are 3 variations of the carbon footprint label and an explanation of the information they contain:

[Product's carbon footprint label variations](https://i.redd.it/2j36tppjwyi31.jpg)

This design would only provide information about a product’s carbon footprint. As climate change is the most pressing concern we collectively face, increasing awareness of how much carbon dioxide emissions are caused by different food products is paramount and should be our main priority when considering sustainability labelling.

**Carbon footprint:** The CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of the product.

**Colour:** A traffic light system is used so consumers can quickly identify if a product’s carbon footprint is low (green), medium (amber), or high (red).

**CO² in kilos:** The total carbon emissions caused by the product are displayed in kilogrammes. This would include emissions created during the farming, processing and shipping of a food product.

**Percentage of daily emissions limit:** Each person should have a daily carbon footprint target, or allowance. Much like the daily reference intakes displayed on food nutrition labelling in the UK, making it easier to work out if your diet has an acceptable carbon footprint or not. The target would be calculated based on a level of CO² emissions deemed acceptable for each person.

&amp;#x200B;

# Product's overall sustainability label

Here are 3 variations of the overall sustainability label and an explanation of the information they contain:

[Product's overall sustainability label variations](https://i.redd.it/7zsbqdccxyi31.jpg)

This design would combine a variety of different food sustainability factors and condense them into a very simple explanation of whether a product is sustainable or not. Helping consumers make a more informed purchase, without bombarding them with lots of information. This could include elements such as:

* CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of a product
* Land required to produce a product

**Categorisation:** An obvious classification of whether a product is sustainable or not.

**Colour:** A traffic light system is used so consumers can quickly identify if a product is sustainable (green), unsustainable (amber) or extremely unsustainable (red).

**Explanation:** A simple explanation of how much the food product impacts the environment.

# Product's sustainability breakdown label

Here is an example of the product's sustainability breakdown label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label](https://i.redd.it/cdotgrssxyi31.jpg)

This design would identify all of the major elements of a food product’s life cycle and their individual impact on the environment. It would also provide an overall indication of whether the product is sustainable or not. It closely mimics [the standardised nutrition labelling format already used in the UK](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/fop-guidance_0.pdf), making it easier for people to adapt to this labelling system. While it is a lot of information for consumers to digest, it would allow consumers to make well informed choices about what food they eat.

**Sustainable daily consumption quota:** this is a guideline limit to how much one person can sustainably consume on a daily basis. Each resource shown (carbon footprint, water usage, etc) would have an independent percentage, relative to what our planet can sustain. 

**Resources:** 5 different aspects of food production would be scrutinised:

* **Carbon footprint:** the CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of a product
* **Water usage:** the total amount of water required to produce a product
* **Land usage:** the total amount of land required to produce a product
* **Single use packaging:** the amount of non-recyclable packaging used for a product
* **Chemical waste:** the amount of chemical waste created during the production of a product

 **Carbon footprint**

Here are 3 variations of the carbon footprint portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: carbon footprint variations](https://i.redd.it/ovouqxx9zyi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if a product’s carbon footprint is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **CO² in kilos:** The total carbon emissions, displayed in kilogrammes, created during the farming, processing and shipping of a food product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily CO² emissions limit is used by the product.

**Water usage**

Here are 3 variations of the water usage portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: water usage variations](https://i.redd.it/3nvl92bvzyi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of water required to produce a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Water in litres:** The total amount of water required to produce a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily water consumption limit is used by the product.

**Land usage**

Here are 3 variations of the land usage portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: land usage variations](https://i.redd.it/lmb6p1530zi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of land required to produce a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Land in metre squared:** The total amount of land required to produce a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily land consumption limit is used by the product.

**Single use packaging**

Here are 3 variations of the single use packaging portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

&amp;#x200B;

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: single use packaging variations](https://i.redd.it/8l5tstag0zi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of non-recyclable packaging used for a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Percentage of single use packaging:** The total amount of single use packaging used by a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily single use packaging limit is used by the product.

**Chemical waste**

Here are 3 variations of the chemical waste portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

https://i.redd.it/s7fo90yr0zi31.jpg

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of chemical waste generated by a product’s production is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Chemical waste in grammes:** The total amount of chemical waste generated by a product’s production.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily chemical waste limit is used by the product.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

It is clear that implementing any kind of sustainability labelling system would be a complex endeavour. Not only would the life cycle of a product need to be rigorously researched, but the proven sustainability of a product would have to be heavily policed. An independent body would be required to refine and govern such a scheme, as it is unlikely that food manufacturers could be trusted to do it themselves. 

Some may say that sustainability labelling is too complex and laborious to introduce. But the fact is, [there are numerous independent studies](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full) that detail how sustainable different types of food are. The information is available, which means that sustainability labelling is possible. If consumers are being expected to make more environmentally conscious food choices, it is only fair that we are given clear information on food packaging that helps us do this.

Without government oversight and participation, sustainability labelling is unlikely to be implemented, so pressure from voters is needed to get governments to act. If you agree that the introduction of a sustainability labelling system would be a benefit to consumers, show your support by signing one of the petitions I have created. There is a UK petition and an EU petition. If neither is applicable to your country of residence, create your own petition to your government!",environment,1566906244,AugustusCP,0,2,True,2019-08-27 07:44:04

Runaway Mass Extinction = Inevitable + Inexorable
---
According to the University of Michigan, the U.S. cut 90% of its forests since 1600. See link:

http://resilience.earth.lsa.umich.edu/units/deforestation/image006.jpg

The U.S. wiped out anywhere from 50-100 million buffalo in a matter of decades in the 1800s.

There used to be so many passenger pigeons in the US, that their annual migration would block out the noon day sun, turning daylight into dark.

There used to be so many cod off Cape Cod that early explorers were afraid they would lift the ship up out of the water and capsize them, and the noise of their bodies scraping against the outside of the hull terrified the sailors.

There used to be so many sea turtles in the Caribbean that the weight of all their bodies totalled more than the weight of all the buffaloes that once roamed the great plains.

There used to be so many insects, people had to wash them off their vehicles every few hundred miles during road trips.

Nowadays, humans and livestock consume 40% of the green stuff that grows on all earth's land each year.

Humans and livestock are 97% of the weight of all the land vertebrates on earth.

Our crops are so poisonous that nothing else can grow or live for miles around. Even the germs in our soil can't stand it. The fish, frogs, birds, insects and mammals can't survive anywhere near our croplands. Our farms are lifeless green deserts. The only thing that can withstand all this poison are modified crops.

Neonic seeds are so poisonous you have to wear gloves to handle them, pets are warned away from them, and just 3 neonic seeds will kill a bird.

Our oceans are set to wipe out most all the plankton on earth, as ocean acidification primes itself to go supernova. While explosive ocean acidification die off events have happened before, they have **never** happened at today's breakneck speed. Even the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs didn't have so explosive and complete effect on the oceans as we are having now.

We are fundamentally unable to grasp how hopeless things have become. We keep thinking we can prevent this. We keep thinking we can ""do"" something about it. 

The upcoming mass extinction is inexorable and inevitable. It cannot be stopped or reversed. This guarantee is 100X stronger than any guarantee Elon Musk and Bernie Sanders promise you.

"Treating the root cause, not the symptom.","A century ago, economies debated the benefits and disadvantages of  Capitalism versus Socialism. Their conclusion was, Capitalism acted as a motivator to progress with the promised monetary reward and Socialism inhibited the human need to produce since he was cushioned and guarenteed basic services. So, a Monkey does tricks, it will get a banana versus it does or does not, a box of bananas will always be there.

Though we are not monkeys, and people do evolve even if we still have primal genetics. The world today, sure made its remarkable advances but at what cost? 

The blindly persue of capital is destroying our humanity and our only home. Wars, disease, pollution, dictators, ignorant politicians. All in the persuit of the same thing. Money. 

Without that monetary gain, we will lose access to health, education, shelter, clean food and water, clothing, etc.. In this time of ours, the fight to guarentee these essentials is becoming more competitive and aggressive. We humans are compromised of many characters, one of which is greed. But to each character, exists a balance. Too much of anything is an imbalance and results in a specific pathology. Greed has become a wide spread cancer, pushing people to do what it takes to guarentee any of those basic essentials.

The fires of the Amazon; The waste in our water; the chemicals in our food; All have a route cause. The fight to gain capital to buy essentials of survival and also pleasure.

I would like to believe that we are evolving to take pride in our work and our advancement. But let us think for a minute, how can we abolish the monetary system or what would it take to control our pathology that is massacering our humanity and our only home. What would it take for us to create a world similar to the federation of Star Trek. 

Elimination of poverty; Essentials are guarenteed; The recouperation of our environment; Our pride and reward results from our advancement and progress of our specialized work or studies; Elimination of wars; A new system of governance based on all of the above.

Be ready to do this Sep 20, and be ready to continue to do this for years to come, we have the biggest battle of our lives coming up and no one is going to fight for us, no one is going to send us help, we have to fight climate apartheid with our bodies.

The leaders we have took us hostage and are driving us off a cliff, I'm talking the billionaire class, the CEO's and executive boards and the politicians, the consultant class, the war profiteers and slavers and almost the entire upper 3%, and they are showing absolutely no signs of slowing this train down, they are profiting more off the destruction of the environment than ever.  Instead of being proactive to address the carbon output problem, they are being reactionary, they are looking out for themselves personally,  [The government of Indonesia has a solution](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/indonesia-move-capital-jakarta-borneo-1.5259686)!  Move away from the ocean and say goodbye to all those who can't afford or aren't aware to move from Jakarta.     
 I suspect many governments will follow suit, they will abandon all the coastal cities and leave the people there to fend for themselves.

In public the billionaires and the corporations and governments express skepticism about climate change, and therefor don't put any money into solutions to stop it, in private however, they all know the truth, Exxon knew about climate change since 1982, they published an internal document that predicted we would break 415ppm of carbon in the atmosphere by 2019 with warming of 0.9 degrees, we achieved both of these wonderful goals this year and in 2017 respectively, that same report predicts we will hit 3 degrees of warming by 2080, yet, Exxon and the rest of the oil companies still pumped billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere.

""The Event"" is the moment when climate catastrophe truly strikes us and there is no stabilizing of the rational order; the oceans have risen enough to push most or every coastal city into absolute chaos, worldwide trade breaks down(after all, how do you trade when all the ports are underwater?), billions of people migrating away from the coasts, droughts, floods and melted glaciers will lead to food and water shortages, this in turn could cause internecine civil wars, hundreds of millions of people are at risk of being starved to death or murdered, governments will commit genocide and set up concentration camps to figure out who gets fed and who doesn't, and the people that will suffer this tragic fate will be the global poor.  Oh, I shouldn't forget, possibly nuclear war over water and borders, lets hope Pakistan and India and China have rational leaders in 30-50 years.

They drove this human experiment off the cliff on purpose for money and power and they destroyed every opportunity we had to stop this train so that they could eek out a few more dollars, they did this knowing it could lead to the deaths of billions of people and possibly destroy all life on earth and now they feel entitled to hide away in their bunkers and use their money to fund mars colonies and space arks while telling the rest of us to die in the streets.  Fuck them, they can't get away with this.  before we are finished fixing this mess, we need to imprison every person that has a hand in disinformation campaign about climate change, the billionaires and millionaires who profited off climate change and all the politicians who let them skate and probably took payments for doing so.  These people don't deserve their freedom after what they've done, it's quite possible that a future world will regard Oil and Gas companies as the worst mass murderers in human history (given that they've used the US military and mercenary armies to prosecute genocides to ""open up oil and gas markets"" I already give them that designation).   To be clear, the average Joe working in coal or in O&amp;G doesn't deserve any punishment, they are just average people trying to feed their families.

"So, how do I travel in an environmentally friendly way?","I just flew back from my home town into my last year at college and now, I realized how bad it was to fly. 
I used to do greyhound, but the trip via greyhound was 18 hours and I just didn’t like riding on that bus anymore.  They are always late. My last trip had a three hour layover.  
  
The problem is that, I am already trying my best for the environment, being vegan, living minimalist, (I am trying to go zero waste, but it’s been a struggle since well, I only have $19 dollars in bank account right now as I am posting this.) etc. I don’t own a car because I am broke. So, I mainly carpool my way around campus because of friends. 

There isn’t a subway station here. It’s not a big city like New York. 

I thought about taking a train, but Amtrak is not in my neighborhood or near my city. 

The thing is that, how the heck do I travel around in an environmentally friendly way?

What do we do?,"For context, I'm American. Living under the Trump administration, and I'm not a fan, but I also havent been terribly impacted by his political decisions either. My viewpoint is ""hes not a good leader. We should replace him"" that's about it. This isnt meant to be a trump discussion, but for transparency, I figured I'd put it out there.

What do we have to do to save the planet for future generations? As an American, I feel that we have a responsibility to, at the very least, play an important role in this. Not because i have an American flag tattoo on my ass, or that I have a pet bald eagle, but because this is a global issue...and globally, we have quite a bit of influence in how this planet is run. We also have quite a few people that want to take a crack at this ""save the planet"" perspective...like Bernie Sanders. Even if we were theoretically to go with a plan like Bernie's (and disregard how this might negatively impact the average US citizen; as someone who lives  in a low income area of the US, (yes....depending on the region, we can be very uneducated) best case scenario, the US goes green. It doesnt stop any country like China or India from continuing their massively  environmentally destructive way of life.

I guess my whole opinion is that (shocklingly) the welfare of our planet...involves all humans...regardless of borders, race, gender, or financial wellbeing. And at the current state the planet is in, we are letting short term success dictate the future of an entire species.

The Amazon not only provides oxygen for a planet that currently deforests at an alarming rate. (Yes I know there are movements to reforest, and I think they're amazing humanitarian efforts. However, those trees will take decades to grow to maturity. So without them being fully mature, how does that impact our current environment?  (genuinely asking)

So at what point do we (in theory) pitch the idea of a global council. Every country that cares about the future of the human race, decides to participate. If you dont, then you are assumed to be an enemy of the planet. I realize this sounds quite radical, but try telling this to a generation of children that dont exist because our environmental negligence prevented them from being born in the first place 

I'm sure this post will be looked over. I dont claim to be the first person to say this. I'm certainly not a scientist. I certainly dont have the answers. And that's my point. How long do we wait for BS like the amazon completely burning down before we, as a planet, decide to care not only about the state of our country's borders, and instead the state of our entire species?",environment,1566966683,Senarin21,0,3,True,2019-08-28 00:31:23
Making the Supply Chain Greener Within the Electronics Industry," 

This article informs readers of the negative impact the electronic supply chain is having on our planet and how you can improve it.

According to www.thebalancesmb.com only 15-20 percent of e-waste is recycled which is extremely low. Over the past decade there has been an increase in environmental concern worldwide. This concern has grown due to regular environmental protests, social media trends such as ‘trash tag’ where people collect as much rubbish as they can, environmental activists obstructing day to day activities and video campaigns showing the damage that pollution has done to our planet.

It would be an immense favor if you could donate to my fundraiser. If you really can't donate, don't worry, there is a way that you could help me. By sharing my post or the link to my GoFundMe, while asking people to not only donate, but to keep sharing this link so we can reach the most people possible.
I started the fundraiser with a goal of 1,500.00$, but of course we all aim to surpass our limits. I will be donating myself and will take care of the fees so that every dollar you give, will reach One Tree Planted NPO.
This non-profit organization has made it as simple as 1$ = One Tree Planted!
I really hope everyone can help me reach my goal and to go even further beyond so we can be able to save the world!

Food Wastage &amp; The Environment,"One of the biggest problems facing mankind is that food wastage. This problem can be solved by being conscious of what we buy and also by using products like [FRESH PAPER](https://www.buyhomespirit.com/fresh-paper). 

**An Ongoing Endeavor:**

Did you know that 33%-50% of all food produced globally is never eaten? The value of this amount is about $1 trillion dollars. This amounts to 1.3% of the total GDP of the United States. This is a giant inefficiency that is not seen in any other industry around the world. 

**Morally Wrong:**

800 million people around the world go to bed hungry every night. That amounts to 1 in 9 people around the world. All 800 million can be fed if we fed them less than a quarter of the food that is wasted in the UK, USA and Europe each year.

Hunger is not something that only developing countries are facing, rather in the UK there are over 1 million people that need food and over 40 million Americans live in food poverty. 

**Environmentally Wrong:**

If food wastage was a country it would be the 3rd biggest emitter of greenhouse gases behind USA &amp; China. It would have a land mass that is larger than China and accounts for 25% of fresh water consumed worldwide.

**The Culprits:**

The shocking reality is that 50% of food wastage takes place in our home. Only 2% of wastage takes place in retail stores. We must take personal responsibility to ensure that we protect our planet and save our environment.",environment,1567020431,Kali21x,3,0,True,2019-08-28 15:27:11

Permission to Fight For Earth,"Permission
By: Walid N. Hakim 

We try to live our lives with rules, laws, and personal codes of conduct. Invisible lines that become all too real when crossed. These rules and laws have, for the most part, been essential to maintaining order in growing civilizations. Without such order, advances in agriculture, science, language, and the arts would have never flourished, and any discoveries would be lost to time, never again to be seen or used by humankind.  With order, poets wrote songs and sonnets, doctors shared healing remedies, artists ignited social movements and created masterpieces that have lasted millennia, influencing future artists for generations.

Rules, laws, codes and order do not however, run in concert to justice and peace. In fact, they seldom do.  For generations, people have subjugated entire cultures, religions, and ethnicities to satiate nothing more than greed. Unchecked human greed has no bounds, no limits, no restraint, and no morals.
These atrocities are often codified into law. Every atrocity was legal at least to one party. Genocide, slavery, invasion, annexation, occupation, theft, all of these atrocities were committed under the laws of nations. Laws are not designed for justice or peace, just order! An Obscene Order.
 
What is Obscene Order one might ask? It is the trade off when a society relinquishes its demand for justice in exchange for peace and order. Under this arrangement; slavery, discrimination, theft and war are necessary tools to preserve order, as long as the victims are never one of us. That, is Obscene Order. 

Under Obscene Order, depleting the oceans and land of all of their resources is necessary as long as there is a positive cost benefit, and zero to minor reperocussions to self. Under Obscene Order, destroying the eco system, the planet, was necessary as long as the current powers never had to experience any blowback. As long as the problems could be passed on to the future, this order has been deemed necessary by world governments and corporations alike. Obscene Order, Capitalism, must end. 

This relinquishing of destructive power and wealth will not end voluntarily. The nations most benefiting from Obscene Order have no incentive to relinquish any of their luxuries. The millionaire class will have to lower their standards, to middle class, so that future generations may live outside of water wars, and fights for farm land. They control the corporations, the corporations control the elections, the election winners control the government, the government sets rules for the corporations. They all depend on each other for survival and would never turn on each other jeopardizing their symbiotic relationship.

Nations will not give permission to end themselves. Corporations will not give permission to end their ways. We must not ask permission to save our planet from the very ones responsible for its destruction, but from others. The Earth will not deny permission to anyone that acts on its behalf. The Earth needs defenders to protect life and the ecosystems that support us. Therefore, permission is granted to those that wish to save our beloved planet, and to take action against those that would do it harm. The Civil Defense Corps has answered the call to defend the Earth from harm, and we have a plan.

Jerking Off Crows To Save Them From Extinction,"Elizabeth Kolbert's book The Sixth Extinction ends with one of the more bizarre stories I have read anywhere.

At the San Diego zoo, during the ""breeding season,"" a woman conversationist Durrant jerks off an endangered male Hawaiian crow for his semen. The book goes: ""Crows do not have phalluses, so Durrant stroked the area around his cloaca."" The bird is currently extinct in the wild, so conservationists are trying to rake up their numbers in private zoos and labs before reintroducing them in the wild. As of one of the last remaining males of his species, this particular crow is in the rather unique position of getting handjobs from a female of another species, who, of course, doesn't love him at all, but only cares about a ""high-quality ejaculate.""

Before this story, every time I thought of conservation, I thought, perhaps simplistically, of hordes of people planting samplings in the ground. After this story, I will never be able to think of conservation without thinking of a crow, sitting in a cage, getting jerked off.

The Amazon Rainforest Has Been Burning For More Than 16 Days," 

Brazil's Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of forest fires but the one that is currently blazing acres of land is said to be the biggest forest fire on the planet. The damage done by this fire is so massive that the smoke can be seen from space! **Nasa** recently released images of the fire and its impact from space. The Amazon rainforest is the biggest rainforest on this planet and it is responsible for producing large quantities of oxygen. As the wildfire spreads, it will drastically increase the global temperature of the planet over time. There has been a tremendous loss of flora and fauna in the Amazon rainforest and a number of species of flora and fauna are endangered by this blaze.

"Amazon rainforest, pls help","So, I left my home country (which happens to be Brazil) and I see that the Amazon Rainforest is on fire for about 3 weeks and I was not aware of it, I just knew yesterday. What do I do? I cant sleep, if I happen to read about it or I start to cry or I get SOOO angry that I only want to cry (I always cry). So I need some advice on what should I be feeling, actions that could help amazon (we, brazilians, r very connected to nature and I feel our nature, what mother earth gave us, os going away n never to return). 

Then I remember, that it'll never grow back, bc the same location in Africa, burned (they also had a rainforest there) and never returned.

I hve no 1 to talk to, my only option is my mom: she'll think that I'm overreacting or that only bc she loves the rainforest ""more"" than me, that means that I don't love the rainforest.

And the worst part is that the Forest gives us oxygen!!!

So my question is: is there any way to make the ppl n our super shitty president know that this should be stopped? Or any meditation or something like that to help me live while our most important rainforest is one fire? Or maybe try to talk to my mom (shes having her on breakdown right now)?

So, while writing this post, I hve a solution for half of my problems (pls respond all my questions above) when school starts again, I'll talk to my science teacher or English teacher (I'm in a country that speaks english) about it, and I'll se if I can do projects to present to the school regarding it.

It’s time to end the myth that “third world pollution” excuses high income countries’ inaction.,"I found a reddit post about how “India and China and a multitude of African countries” (seemed racially biased but I let it slide) were responsible for climate change and that holding individual “Americans and Europeans” responsible was wrong.

Here was my response because I don’t want to write everything again:

Sorry, that’s just absolute bs. China sure. India? They don’t even create half the carbon emissions of the US, and they have 4x the population.

The EU emits significantly more carbon than India with less than half the population.

Who is next? Russia Japan Germany South Korea Iran Saudi Arabia Canada Indonesia

I could go on, the only country in Africa even close to the top of the list is South Africa, and I get the sneaking suspicion that its demography precludes them from the countries you were thinking of but I would be more than happy if I were wrong.

“But per capita...”

1.	⁠The climate doesn’t care about per capita emissions. All that matters is net emissions, and per capita emissions are only relevant for assigning responsibility geopolitically, or in your case, trying to abandon responsibility.
2.	⁠Also, you would just be wrong again were you to make this argument. China is below New Zealand in per capita emissions, and I am not going to count 40+ countries down the list to find exactly how far down they are.
3.	⁠African countries? None in the top thirty. The highest in per capita emissions in Africa is South Africa, and I really don’t think that was a country you were referring to.
4.	⁠India is nowhere to be seen in terms of per capita pollution.
5.	⁠High income countries lead per capita emissions by a strong margin.

Carbon emissions are not all that matter of course. Methane and other pollutants are also relevant. You can guess how the American agricultural/chemical industry affects our numbers on those fronts.

Individual Americans and Europeans aren’t to blame. I agree, with exception for the political structures that we vote for which enable industrial environmental carelessness and exploitation.

It’s not about who is ‘technically marginally more responsible for climate impact’ even if that were the case, which it isn’t, it is about what we have power to change, and as the second most co2 emitting country, that is a lot to be changed.

Since hybrids are more fuel-efficient, it is largely agreed that they are a better environmental choice than traditional gasoline. However, since hybrids create more emissions during production, and gasoline vehicles are becoming more fuel-efficient, it raises some questions.

Norway stops Amazon fund contribution in dispute with Brazil - More countries need to follow their lead!!!,"Norway has stopped all future payments to the Amazon fund ($1.2B fund in total - its majority has been contributed by Norway). Germany has also suspended its payments to the fund (payments will be on 'pause' until Bolsonaro changes his policy towards the Amazon's deforestation). 

The fund was primarily used as an incentive to preserve the Amazon and to reward Brazil for responsible behavior. However, since Bolsonaro has taken an aggressive step in the opposite direction, Norway and Germany have halted future contributions (for now) to the fund. 

More countries, *especially* those privy to the Paris Agreement, need to speak up and shift future economic investment away from Brazil because MONEY TALKS. 

Norway and Germany are ahead of the curve, and are leading by example.

The more economic pressure put on Bolsonaro, the more likely that he will **not** be re-elected in 2023 (he can be renewed for one more 4-year term). This is the goal.

**Please voice your opinion**, and focus to keep this news ALIVE - the more people that google, like, comment, and share posts related to the Amazon and its deforestation the more profitable it will be for the media to pick it up.

2. As an employee/ employer, I would take the opportunity to promote food purchasing decisions that are environmentally low cost.

3. If my employer were making food choices environmental cost, then I would consider making similar choices in my life?

4. If an organisation were certified for food environmental impact, I would support and promote their brand?

5. I will choose food if it is ecologically responsibly source?

Plan for Ending Beef (permanently),"So cattle ranching is the main driver of amazon deforestation, and climate change. The solution here is to cut beef consumption, but people are too lazy to do that. 

I propose we band together and put our funds towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that would then be used to transparently fund pathogen research to create a killer disease that will wipe out cows selectively. The pathogen should spread quickly, and be harmless to other forms of life. The pathogen should be humane in that it will sterilize the cows rather than kill them outright. After pathogen research, creation, and testing the DAO would fund export of the pathogen worldwide, and launch a worldwide kill strike against the entire beef industry. 

People will moan and cry, but the economic realities will quickly take over, and the only beef left would be lab grown meats. Yes, I am proposing extincting a genus of animal, (including water buffaloes and wild cows) but the alternative is too terrible to bear witness too.

The first step of launching a DAO like this is to hire a developer who can write a smart ethereum contract that will govern the DAO funds and fund allocation, and place full control of funds to voters. I think community discussion on the mechanics of the voting and governance models are of utmost importance here. 

The second step of launching our DAO is to publish the smart contract to the blockchain, and attract investors. Ideally, we could get every single member of /r environment to chip in $10 or more. The goal here is to get enough funding to buy a lab, lab supplies, and equipment. We need infrastructure. We will also need to hire a few genetic engineers, the initial group should probably be cheaper students who can direct us on what to buy for equipment, and where to direct our focus.

The third step is to use the remaining funds to advertise our DAO, and get enough funding for hiring a team for 3-5 years of research and development of the pathogen. We will have difficulty attracting scientists who are not woke on climate change reality because our goal is fundamentally destructive in nature. That is why we will either need a large warchest, or good connections or both. At project end, all unused funds should be distributed proportionately back to each contributor. This is a not for profit.   
For the first step, I would like to use a multisignature ethereum wallet that requires sign off by multiple parties for any transaction. Ideally, signature holders would be leading members of the community such as mods, or well respected forum members. I think that this effort would best take place in a separate thread where people with older accounts high karma, and many posts in /renvironment are the ones to make nominations. I think nominations of worthy signature holders should have a number of secondary ratifications by high karma high posting redditors. Figuring out how we are going to distribute trust in a democratic nature is very important. The signature holders would become a sort of board, as they have the power of the purse. I have a few ideas on how a seperate power structure could modify the boards voting power such that deadlocks don't occur, but that is for another thread that would come after a whitepaper is written. If you want to contribute to this discussion, please nominate an outstanding community member, and second community members you think are worthy of being signatory holders.",environment,1566604027,Leftwing_agitator,9,4,True,2019-08-23 19:47:07
I'm Just Sad At This Point,"I didn't know where else to put this, so if I'm in the wrong place, let me know. 


Everything seems to be getting worse and I don't think we'll be able to stop it at this point. I want this planet to be here for future generations and it saddens me to think that they'll have to inherit something from a dystopia. 

I also feel a huge pressure to undertake the task of fixing all this and I feel like I'll fail. I'm 18, and I feel like this represents a feeling shared by a lot of people around my age. 

For any older people reading: When you were younger, especially in high school, did you ever get pressure from adults that you were going to be the generation to ""fix things""? 

I get that we're not the first generation to have this problem. CFCs, pesticides and possibly asbestos (shaky on my decades here) were huge issues in the 70s and 80s. You probably felt huge pressure to fix that. 

No one has told me specifically ""your generation is going to save the planet"" but I get that feeling from people. I don't feel like we can fix all the crap we need to fix. By the time we're old enough to be politicians and fix all the environmental protections that were knocked down, it'll be too late. I just saw something that said if another fifth of the Amazon burns, we'll lose it all beyond human intervention. We don't have the power to fix that.

I don't know, sometimes I just think ""What's the point?"" We think we might be able to salvage this mess and then somebody goes and burns a forest down.

Why The Blue Glow Of Chennai Waves Is Bad For the Environment," 

The visitors at the Thiruvanmiyur beach in Chennai were in for a surprise last week. Known for its clean and picturesque beaches, the people of Chennai were given another reason to flock to the beaches. The newfound reason?  Over the past week, the waters at the beach have gained a blue, almost magical glow. 

Last week, as soon as the news of blue, sparkling waves hitting the shore went viral, so did the social media posts and videos. Bioluminescent waves along the shore were spotted on Sunday night by the visitors at the beach. 

After the initial fanfare regarding the Bioluminescent waves died down, the reason for its occurrence came to light. Caused by a phytoplankton type named Noctiluca scintillans, bioluminescence occurs when they convert their chemical energy into light energy on being washed ashore. As the waves hit the shore, the energy conversion takes place causing it to emit a blue glow on the face of the waves. The phenomenon is commonly also known as 'sea sparkle'.

Should we choose a different topic to focus on? If so, which ones and what activities can we do that will make somewhat of a difference? Last year's topic was marine debris, and we made absolutely no change. But this year, I am very determined to make a pretty meaningful change.

Siberia forest fires,"I appreciate  the attention reddit and some governments have shown the fires in Amazon rain forests. But I would like to remind everyone that Earth has 2 great lungs. One is Amazon the second is Siberia. 

Siberia has been burning almost all of this summer. Areas where there used to be permaforst are starting to disappear. While in the spirit of Chernobyl the Russian government has been trying to hide it and refused outside help. 

This problem has arisen due to global tendencies but that is not the only reason. For years deforestation has been going on in Siberia not only by the local Russian industries but by them leasing huge swaths of forests to the Chinese who cut them down for their own needs. 

By this post I am not trying to give any political statement or demean what is happening in Brazil, but to at least bring some attention to our planets second great lung - Siberia.

I am very inclined to believe humans are greatly accelerating global warming by modifying the atmosphere, however I am also naturally suspicious of all information due to all the self-promoting celebrities, people saying that it's overblown to raise taxes, etc.

I really just want to learn the truth of the severity from an unbiased source. I have had some very bad experiences with activists, so I'm just hoping for some calm direct explanation on the topic without any ""media frenzy""

Is there a place with compiled all the information like what methods are used to determine causation between CO2 emissions and climate change, predictions, how much we contribute vs. how much natural factors like the sun contribute, etc?

Basically the fact that I'm not a climate scientists means that any side of the debate can fool me, so I decided to ask here since there are a lot of people on the sub, so I might get a lot of different sources that are supposedly unbiased.

Difference Between Frogs And Toads,"A lot of people wonder how frogs and toads differ. Well, the surprising answer is that they don’t really differ that much!

Frogs and toads differ and tend to be [amphibians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian), meaning they’re able to live in and from water. They both vertebrates and fit in with the class which includes salamanders. But while salamanders look a lot more like lizards with long bodies and tails, both frogs and toads are short-bodied and tail-less, hence their Greek name “anura.”

They also develop just like, from being mostly born as eggs, living under water as larvae or tadpoles, then living on both water and land as adults. They both have vocal cords too and will even make sounds under water. Plus, both must breed and lay their eggs in water.

But this is where the similarities end. The most obvious way frogs and toads differ is by using their skin. Frogs have smooth, wet, and velvety (or slimy) skin because they usually stay quite near the water. The toad is much more adventurous and travels from the water, leading to dry, warty skin.

Frogs tend to lay their eggs in bodies of water without fish. These eggs form a rounded shape. Toad eggs taste nasty and may come in inhabited bodies of water. They usually undertake an extended chain-like shape.

20 Facts about Sir Isaac Newton What Leave You a Flabbergasted! 😲," 

[Source: Infoqwiki.com](https://i.redd.it/b3n8fl51h4h31.jpg)

Sir Isaac Newton is that a name who singlehandedly changed the definition of science. He was a mathematician, an astronomer, an author, a historian, a theologian as well as a philosopher at the same time! Today he is considered one among those greatest scientists the world has ever seen so far. And here we are going to unveil 20 facts about him, which people hardly heard of before! 

 **1.** We know the story of the discovery of Gravity. But scholars think the story to be tale made famous by the French writer Voltaire. However, a group of scholars think the story to be partly true.

**2.** There was Newton’s sketch in the first-ever logo of the Apple company. The sketch was about the moment when Newton sat under an apple tree and an apple was about to fall down on him and he was going to have ideas of gravity.

**3.** In the year 1665, the plague was spread out in the various parts of England. Newton was then studying in the Trinty College in Cambridge. The college authority sent him home along with his mates. Fortunately, the period turned out to be very productive for Newton. He discovered Calculus and some laws of physics which we call Newtonian Physics today.

**4.** In the early years of discoveries, Newton was somewhat introvert about his works. He used to hide his inventions lest people thought him wrong and things went adverse.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: Infoqwiki.com](https://i.redd.it/oytjq8t5h4h31.png)

**5.** Despite being a scientist he was a religious person. And it is proved where he himself wrote, “Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.”

**6.** Though he was theist he never believed in the existence of satan, ghost or spirit.

**7.** Newton was seriously fascinated by the Bible. He immensely went through the Bible. However, he wrote about religion and history much more than science!

**8.** After reading the Bible, Newton predicted that Jesus had been crucified exactly on 3 April 33 AD.

**9.** He firmly believed that the universe will not destroy before 2060.

**10.** It’s said that Newtone foretold that the Jews would again regain their land. And it has proven true!

**11.** His interest in the Bible made him learn the Hebrew language so that he could realize the profound meaning of the religion! Surprisingly, he spent almost half of his working life on deciphering religion!

**12.** Sir Isaac Newton was born in the year when Galileo Galilei passed away!

**13.** Newton was born prematurely. His size and weight were so less that he could be placed in a mug! Chances of his survival were very uncertain at that time.

**14.** The father’s name of Sir Isaac Newton was also Isaac Newton.

**15.** Newton’s father died 3 months before his birth.

**16.** Newton remained unmarried in his entire life.

**17.** Newton was born to a farmer’s family. His mother wanted him to be a farmer. But Newton did not like farming at all!

**18.** Newton was the first among those scientists who told the earth is not round but Elliptical.

**19.** The descendant of the apple tree in which the idea of gravity came from is reserved in present England. However, the original tree was ruined between 1815 and 1820.

**20.** A piece of wood of the apple tree along with Sir Isaac Newton’s photograph has been sent to space as a message to the aliens!",environment,1566097121,infoqwiki,1,0,True,2019-08-17 22:58:41

amazon,"yesterday the brazilian city of são paulo and a lot of citys in its surroundings at 4pm were covered by a cloud from the burning of the amazon rainforest in rondônia. it looked like it was night.

são paulo is far from rondônia, more specifically 3300km or 2052 miles. it's pretty far. imagine the size of the fire that did that.

ppl could feel the smell of burning in the rain.

this is embarrassing for brazil.

everyone knows fires are common this time of the year, but rondônia has been burning from 16 days and we are only talking ab this rn bc we could see some the effects of it and still some ppl still don't believe it.

in my opinion brazil should explore the forest but in a sustainable way, allowing the future generations to take advantage of the things the forest can offer as well.
they aren't doing this, the way the government is exploring the forest doesn't benefit anyone but the ppl that are currently overusing the resources (like loggers). the future generations won't have resources or water provided by the rainforest and rn ppl are already paying the cost of this bc for example the smokes from the fires cause breathing problems and to be treated a lot of ppl will go to public hospitals and everyone will pay for it, and that's one example.

i really hope brazil wakes up and understands they should preserve their forest. if this continues they will have to be punished and forced to change.
several european countries give funds so that brazil makes a sustainable and smart exploration, if they don't change, and they probably won't bc their president supports all of this, this funds shouldn't exist.",environment,1566315090,the_starksz,0,4,True,2019-08-20 11:31:30
A job determines a person's role in society. Is your job helping or harming the environment?,"&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ""***A job****, employment, work or occupation,* ***is a person's role in society***.""  - Wikipedia

Your occupation is not only what you do, but also what the company you work for does. What I am trying to say here is that your current job is determining your role in society. 

Pretty important, right?

Many of us are aware of the climate and environmental crisis we are going through, and we know that the economical system as it is now, is not sustainable and it is destroying our planet, our home. This is why many of us eco-conscious people are trying hard to keep an eco-friendly lifestyle by changing the way we consume. The idea behind this is that by changing the demand we will change the supply. Not bad, however, this it is not enough. The next thing we are also doing is supporting ecological projects around us or even going into digital or physical activism. 

Conscious consumers and activists are great and necessary, but I think we are still forgetting something.

Before I  carry on, I would like to ask you employees or contractors a few questions: 

1. Who do you work for? What does your company do? What is their mission and what are their emissions?
2. Have you ever considered changing jobs and spend your working day helping to build a more sustainable world?
3. If you have tried to do that, how hard did you find it? If you have not, do you believe the process will be long winded and hard work?

As I was trying to say, leading the change by example is key, but it is not enough if we do it only as end consumers. As workers we are also producers, and with our time and talent, we are contributing to our employers success. If these companies are big polluters, then we are serving the enemy, not fighting them. 

I will give you a few examples:

1. *PersonA* embraces a ZeroWaste lifestyle. This person works as an accountant for a disposable cups manufacturer. They are producing, on a large scale, what they are trying to stop on a smaller scale.
2. *PersonB* is concerned about the plastic in the ocean. They work as a waiter in a beach bar where they serve everything in single use plastics and make use of straws. Smoking is also permitted but there are not enough ashtrays.
3. *PersonC* is conscious about carbon emissions and tries to use public transport to commute to work. Everyday they  share articles on social media about environmental issues and car pollution. This person is a flight attendant.

Employees are one of the biggest assets of a company. Without employees, a company cannot grow, nor succeed.

Everyday I imagine a world where we conscious consumers stop buying from big polluters AND we workers also stop working for them. 

That thought hit me a couple of years ago, right after I started hitting rock bottom due to an existential crisis and something I like to call EcoAnxiety. I promised myself that, although I didn't know what to do, I would only work for an ecological purpose. I knew my role in society was going to be helping ecology win the battle for the good of humanity and Earth. I knew what companies I did not want to work for, and I knew that if I failed in my decision, I would feel miserable.

I then started my hunt for a job within my skill set which agreed with my environmental values. It ended up being impossible. I found sustainability job sites, but most of them were only offering jobs for environmental scientists or engineers. Job offerings on these kind of sites were very focused within the water and energy industries. 

I kept trying, and I kept learning. I read a lot about our current economical system (which is my field), I discovered Circular economy, Green economy, Blue economy, Ecological economy and many alternative ways to thrive in life without putting our planet on risk. 

&gt;*""The* ***green economy*** *is defined as* ***economy***  *that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities,  and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the  environment.""* \- Wikipedia

This economy is a transversal area within all industries, and there it offers a big variety of jobs for all kinds of companies participating in the green transition. I recently started researching and discovering projects and organisations that are really making a change and I'd like to encourage all you eco-conscious people to have a look as well.

Following my dream of a sustainable world, where people would consciously choose what to consume and who to work for, I started this new project called **EmploGreen**. It's a job board which aims to help companies and professionals find each other in the complex world of green economy and sustainability.

 

    P.S.: If you find EmploGreen interesting, subscribe for updates.

Help save a depleting river," This is for Indian  users only.

First of all, I created this throwaway handle to avoid people using my history as an excuse to not contribute.

Here, I am asking people for contribution towards Cauvery Calling campaign which is aiming to shift at least 30% of farmers in Cauvery river basin towards agro-forestry which will help farmers, soil health, and ground water level.

Entire project will be managed by eminent citizens such as retired Supreme Court Judge, ISRO chairman and such. Details can be found [here](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/board-members) .

I would request this community to contribute to this cause. It takes just 42 Indian Rupees to plant one tree (which include s taking care of sapling and planting it in farmer's field). Go through this small 3-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHwdveBGQk) to find out how this money will be utilized. This campaign has backing of many countries and [UNITED NATIONS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I77yHcKA1eo).

Though you can donate directly, but I would like some of you to donate through this [LINK](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-1429?action=2) . It will help this one particular volunteer reach the pledged goal of 1000 trees. Volunteers or fund raisers **DO NOT** get anything from it, money goes directly to Campaign's account handled by above mentioned committee and audit report will be published. Donating through this [link](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-1429?action=2) may just help a volunteer reach their personal goal.  

India's firs female IPS officer and current Governor of Puducherry [Kiran Bedi](https://twitter.com/thekiranbedi/status/1163812509712695297?s=19) also supports this campaign.

Class struggle and climate are related?,"Recently I saw a video in which while talking about global warming and climate change they claimed that the war against this environmental issues could somehow be related with what we know as class struggle, and I believe it would be interesting to see what people think about this. 

They gave a series of explanations to support this idea:

\-Those who will suffer the consequences of living in a warm and polluted planet more drastically are the same people who at this moment live in the most underdeveloped regions of the world (Africa, South America... etc) both because of the fact that here the effects will be more visible and because of the lack of resources to deal with this. At the same time, in other countries where the economy is more prosperous, those who live in precarious conditions (lower classes) will find it harder to adapt to living in a warmer environment where food could get more expensive, having an air conditioner could become a must, and working outdoors while suffering this extremely warm weather would be a new obstacle for people like farmers or laborers to overcome. Meanwhile those with more money and a ´´comfortable´´ job (higher classes) won´t suffer as much.

\-Both governments and owners of the means of productions have in their hands the chance of taking decissions that could make great changes in this situation. It is mainly because of their actions in the past that we are now living this plight, and their actions in the present and future will be crucial to get out of it. Therefore citizens and consumers should cooperate and fight to alter the choices governments and owners take in order to survive in the future. Sadly, this means that we might be comming to the point where ´´fighting the power´´ could be a neccesary step if fighting for survival.

\-Last but not least I would like to highlight the fact that people who lead a lifestyle of unnecessary consumption and excesses and are thereupon more guilty of this things happening will not suffer the consequences of their own actions as much as those who probably did not have anything to do with the global warming.

A call for action in response to the Amazon fires,"&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As most of you know, the amazon has been on fire for the last 3 weeks. The impact on the environment is enormous. We NEED trees to remove c02 from the air and to create oxygen. In fact, scientists have very recently stated that more trees would slow down climate change.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately there isn’t much we can do for the Amazon right now. But there is something we can do to offset the damage – plant trees. If you’re like me and do not own land, what you can do instead is write your local representatives, colleges, businesses, and push them to prioritize reforestation (government) or to even plant trees.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If we can get this movement viral and trending, we absolutely can make a positive difference. Every tree counts, who knows how else this can evolve?  We have to try. we as a generation NEED to take action and do something. forget the corporate elitists who don't give a shit about the environment, they won't do anything for us.  
&gt;  
&gt;we can make a difference. We can start the Green Wave.

I've done very well for myself financially speaking, and have come into ownership of a large sum of money.  Recently I thought of the possibility, of buying a plot of land, and growing plants in it.  Similar to a small park or something.  I want to make my life style carbon negative, or at least carbon neutral.

However, unfortunately I have not studied this field very much.  

I was wondering just how realistic of a goal is this?  How much land would I need?  Are there other considerations I'll need to consider?

Also what plants should I try to grow?  I have read that bamboo is the best option for this kind of goal, due to how quickly it grows (absorbing more carbon).  But I live in the United States, and I do not believe bamboo can grow in most of the country.

Admittedly a part of me feels a bit naive about all of this, but I'm curious what others had to say.

Editorial:

The Wealth Dividend
---

Big tech is trying to greenwash society. It's the ultimate mind control. Monsanto makes GMO seeds which destroys both soil and intestinal life. The microscopic life in the soil feeds the microscopic life in your guts. GMOs destroy both of them. They do this so they can spray bug and plant poison on them that destroys insects, birds, fish and weeds. The only thing that lives in a green field is the plant modified to survive extreme poison. Monsanto paid Google to derank those poisons. For every story they smother, there's another story they promote, for more money. They're like information brokers, they get paid win or lose, even if it's lose-lose for us.

Germany and northern Europe are the green energy white collar mafia. They burn plastic and paper and call it recycled energy. Their cap and trade carbon credits are a racketeering fraud for fossil fuel corporations and banks. Solar and wind power are 100% fraud. Germany is calling Greta's treehouse gal pal a terrorist. Germany uses solar wind power to build diesel cars that burn palm oil. Germany is razing its own villages and old forests to burn dirty brown coal, to run their solar and wind power. They get 50% of their renewable electricity burning forests imported from around the world. We give them trees, they give us cars. Germany's Bayer bought Monsanto and Deutsche Bank is a $50 trillion dollar time bomb. Northern Europe is the green energy equivalent of Peter Pan with a Hitler moustache.

If we continue with 10 more years of this fraud the earth will die. It won't be better off without us, unless we're subterranean bacteria. There's a 3% chance this won't happen, at most. They tell us we have a 60% chance, but they're ignorant liars. This is because we allow the wealthy to make up the rules that enslave us for their greed. IMO, only a 100% private wealth dividend will prevent total civil chaos. If I were a credentialed expert in civil chaos, I would get paid to calm you down and de-escalate the situation. This is what Google gets paid to do. Google news is the same size as the 5 media outfits that own 90% of our news.

Greed is motivating us to use money to outsmart ourselves. It's another denial projection. It's like when a woman pounds on the protagonist's breast in rage before she kisses him -- like in old movies. It's the outrageous rage of denial wrapped up in the sanctity of race and class. I recommend a strong does of 100% private wealth dividends, with a 100% universal basic income worldwide -- before civil chaos strikes the land of machine guns. Both sides are greedy and power mad, and victory is never without total and absolute consequence. Just sayin.

The top greenwashed product in the world is your mind, what we used to call our soul.

I often see statistics and statements like “the meat and dairy industry have a much higher environmental impact than other non-animal reliant industries.” While this is absolutely true, this is also probably because there are way more people in the world who consume these products than there are people who do not. So if we did completely cut out this industries somehow, wouldn’t that just place more stress on soy/bean/substitute sources? Maybe even enough to completely replace the impact?

Secondly, I see many other vegans arguing that although the soy industry is detrimental to South America, only a small amount of it is actually going to soy products, while the rest is being used to feed animals to be slaughtered. Ok, true. However, as I previously stated, there are many less vegans than non-vegans in the world. If we stopped consuming animals/raising soy for animals, our consumption of soy might rise high enough to completely replace the impact.

"EPA Proposes new Rule to Streamline Section 401 of Clean Water Act, Fast-Tracking Natural gas Pipelines and Limiting State Power","https://www.natlawreview.com/article/epa-proposes-rule-to-narrow-streamline-cwa-section-401-review

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows local authorities (e.g. state governments) the ability to certify (or fail to certify) that their water quality will not be impacted by a federal permitted project. This rule is aimed particularly at states and Native American tribes that have delayed or blocked gas pipelines using this Section, using indirect arguments that fracking causes added risk of groundwater contamination, the use of natural gas leads to worsened climate change and subsequently harm to water resources, erosion during the construction phase leads to sedimentation and pollution of water bodies, and several others. The new rule will allow only direct “point source” pollution from the pipelines to be considered, effectively stripping the power from entities like New York or various tribes that have blocked pipelines, and preventing consideration of some very real water quality threats posed by pipeline construction. 

Additionally, it will only allow a one-year period to issue a water quality certification, meaning there will now be less time to conduct a proper study of water quality impacts by a proposed project, among other problems.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is supposed to regulate pipelines for the effects of climate change per NEPA, but that commission is currently dominated by Trump appointees. Section 401 of the CWA was a measure that allowed local authorities some measure of voice in protecting their water quality.",environment,1565651360,Thunderblast,0,8,True,2019-08-12 19:09:20

Are the Feedback loops as bad as they say they are?,"I'm honestly terrified by those, since it means that the warming will accelerate to points where any effort to lower or mitigate it will be impossible and that there is no hope anymore.

Even the cloud loss scares me, if it's as bad as people say it is.

This has led by to give in and accept that all of us are going to look forward to a future similar to ""The Road"" in or lifetime and we will experience it. I mean many of us have a lifespan that goes as far as the 2080's.

Though then again someone here said that those lops were debunked and disproven. 


/u/ClimateNurse had this to say about them:


- Not exactly. Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova &amp; more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


- The aerosol masking effect is a big cluster of a...Mess, really.


Some predict .4C, but the most common one I see thrown around on Reddit is 1C, but people never seem to note that it is by 2100, and under a specific RCP scenario, rather than what is currently masked. A majority of models indicate lower levels, or around .5C. Various comments from climate scientists also say this.


However, aerosols aren't just black and white like most people say they are- and they're not all from fossil fuel emissions. Some are from agriculture, others from fires, others from fossil fuels (not counting the natural ones). Some also heat the world, rather than cool it, but the variety of places that they come from make it unlikely that we'll see them vanish rapidly.


- Not a good thing, for certain. But it wouldn't be an instant one either, as a reminder.


Dieback (which would happen at ~+3-5°C anyway), would happen over decades (if not longer), but this isn't accounting for deforestation in addition to this. It's important to realize it wouldn't just explode out a lot of carbon!


Forest dieback is defined as trees losing health, and is the decline of a forest after a point has been reached. A lot can go into it, such as pests, disease, etc., but it's nonetheless a progressive or premature loss of trees. They can be in specific areas, elevations, perimeters, etc.


Likely, it would eventually become a net source rather than sink over time, as weve seen with other dying forests, then start to fade away into a Savannah, as predicted. CO2 release due to this would be gradual, rather than instant.


...But the capacity of it isn't nice.


Edit: I'm going to do some more research as OPs links say that it could produce 140 years of human emissions (sounds off to me, even if is from the rainforest trust. But there's a lot of factors at play so im gonna check what others say! I could be wrong.) Also, edited my figures.


PREPARE FOR MATH.


It turns out the Hothouse Earth paper covered this a little, too! (from 2018) So, this paper estimates by 2100 that the Amazon rainforest dieback will add .05°C, under 2C of warming. It has a range of .03-.11°C, BUT is based on extrapolations of observed changes in diebacks and model projections. The total CO2 estimate released by 2100 is also around 15-55 GtC.


2014 articles from Journal of Ecology (posting on mobile, reading on desktop, will post articles here eventually) and the sources used for the Hothouse Earth paper line up with this. So, this seems to support the idea that it will be VERY drawn out. The worst case scenarios run with 24-40% biomass shrinkage by 2100. (15-25 GtC).


I ran some conversions on the claims by rainforest trust as well, w/ 140 billion tons being 127 Gt. I'm...Confused but also bad at math, so someone correct me if I'm wrong here. For reference, humanity releases ~42 GtC per year. Their math lines up with the Hothouse Earth paper w/ how much carbon is stored (they estimated 150-200 GtC).


A rough calculation of GtC to ppm is about (from the IPCC)


1ppm CO2 = 2.12 GtC = 7.76 GtCO2.
So: 1GtCO2 = .127ppm CO2
1GtC = .47 ppm CO2.
1ppm = 0.0046875C.


We see about a 3ppm rise per year, but this also is on a delay. So even the warming released from this would be delayed for a LONG while. It'd add in the end about ~90+-5 ppm, so it'd be in the current roughly 31 years of human emissions by ppm per year, but a bit over 3 by our total emissions per year. (a lot of our emissions are absorbed by the ocean primarily!) This warming would be delayed by a good bit and vary in the end, as we also have a delay in our emissions (.2°C/decade), so this is a lot of complexity, and this also presumes it'd be instant release -and- all released.


So, if the Amazon were to poof and release all of its CO2, it'd end up warming us by around .45C! (used 95 ppm as a reference).


However, this assumes all of it would be in the atmosphere and not in the oceans/vegetation/etc. Humans still will release far more, nonetheless!


Nonetheless, the dieback would likely be due to the fact that the rainforest is a self sustaining system, and after a certain point it would probably start to struggle. Combine that with a changing climate and you've got this. It'd be over a long period, but be irreversible.

Okay, having to rewrite this as I closed the page clicking to a paper to link. Whoops.

To quickly summarize (by 2100)
Permafrost + Methane = .15-.5C (.5C being RCP 8.5, methane hydrates ignored because they're not quite a threat)
Forest fires (boreal forest) = .02-.10C
Amazon dieback realistically = .03-.11C
Land sink change = .13-.27C

Carbon sinks also vary greatly depending on where they're at, what they are, how they'll be affected, what warming we'll hit, etc. So that is also too tricky to put into a singular post. The ocean is also one of our biggest carbon sinks, and absorbs a -lot-. Most of our emissions go into it, rather than vegetation.


I can't cover the carbon cycle much (if at all), as that's a bit out of my depth. I'll bug a climate scientist for sure, but I imagine it'd be similar to other feedbacks- over time, relatively small compared to human emissions.


- Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova &amp; more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) 


The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


-  I've had the 1.6C claim thrown at me recently, so I was curious if it was from the same source. (It was from the temperature anomaly + estimated aerosol masking from the current date, though I've also had other baselines used, vs. what is commonly used- 1850-1900). The IPCC has gotten ice sheet melt wrong by a good measure, but observed warming has been incredibly accurate to date (with minor deviations above average). There's always going to be some deviation in predicted warming, which could also have added to this (they estimated .8C to 1.2C, with an average of 1C warming in the AR5 report.)


For temperatures to rise that high, we'd have to be far beyond...Well, any understandings of the climate, and forgo our observations to date (as our observations are very in-line with CMIP5 modeling), and presume that the climate ECS is far higher than what it is observed to be, or could be- even with the new model estimates.


For presuming averages, we have to take into account land &amp; sea changes, and for the IPCC/Paris Agreement '1.5C', it must be an average of 1.5C over a certain period of time, rather than the average hitting this. (There's a lot of factors that go into consideration of the average, will dig it up when I can!) The average on some years -has- breached 1C repeatedly (the average from observations in 2017 was 1.2C!), but this was expected due to anomalies.



- A: GMOs can and will bridge the gap eventually.

B: Current biodiversity decline is largely due to horrible management of agriculture and pesticides. Those 2 stop we will see significant drops in species dying. Climate change is still an issue obviously but it's not the reasons species are rapidly dying. And just so you know *we are not in the 6th mass extinction*.


Not sure if i should feel better or event rust this at all. because me, like most people concerned about this believe we will see this on our lifetime, are depressed by it and feel hopeless about it. Thinking of the horrible deaths as well as the utter grief of seeing society collapse before our very eyes. Many of us are contemplating suicide even as they are unwilling to live long enough to see that happen.

Heck even much of us accepted and resigned that as the future as governments and corporations do nothing about it or oppose action against it in the face of activism and mounting public concern. Even the people guilty of inaction as they are unwilling to change their lifestyles or are unaware of the concern or even straight up deny  or dismiss it. either saying it wont affect them or having swallowed up the climate denial junk being generated by the right wing and the corporate propagandists. 

I dont know if if they are really as bad as what the articles, and people (including scientists) say but I feel that I will live to see the collapse of society and the extinction of Mankind within my lifetime or even earlier (either in the 2030s or even as early as the 2020s) thanks to the feedback loops. I'm even anticipating the Water Crisis (Nothing is being done to address the drying wells) as well as the collapse of the agricultural system and the famines it will produce thanks to bees going extinct and land becoming unusable as predicted in the IPCC report recently.


Given AR6 report is to be published this December 31st. I'm merely expecting more bad news or straight up ""The window has closed and any attempt now is impossible and the 2030 deadline has shortened"". Especially since this time around. Feedback loops will be taken into account. i can only imagine the disappointment these activists and all of us will have once its stated that it's either impossible at this point or it's too big to even handle anymore. The distraught and grief of them having to face a post apocalyptic world in their lifetime as there is nothing they can do anymore I hope we all accept what's coming and hope we at least die as swiftly, quietly, and as painlessly as possible. we al fear death dont we? And many of us fear a death from disease, starvation thirst and ehat stroke from this. or even getting killed by other survivors when society collapses. I'm even having nightmares of aimlessly wandering around a post apocalyptic world and then dying from hunger, thirs, and the intense heat from the  uncontrolled warming.

Those feedback loops don't make climate change like boiling a frog. It's more ike dying from a terminal sickness that rapidly gets faster.

It's hard if not impossible to have hope and make a difference when the thing you are fighting against increasingly accelerates faster than expected to the point where the deadline is going to hit you like a brick wall.",environment,1565727354,Newman1651,1,3,True,2019-08-13 16:15:54

Well, in terms of CO2 emissions, I bet a single american or european person accounts for an entire family living in a third world country. Sure, not having kids reduces your carbon footprint by **a lot**, but we are still consuming more resources than the planet is capable of.

"What Lies Beneath: The understatement of existential climate risk | David J Spratt, Ian Dunlop + More","Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required
---
Human-induced climate change is an existential risk to human civilisation: an adverse outcome that will either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential, unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced.

Special precautions that go well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts — known as “fat tails” — are to be adequately dealt with. The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact, events would be devastating for human societies.

The bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks, and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach. 

Climate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend toward reticence and caution, erring on the side of “least drama”, and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes. Whilst this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower-probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely. 

This is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points — passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system — such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels), and permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge. 

However the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent, justify strong precautionary management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible,  contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change. 

If climate policymaking is to be soundly based, a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is now urgently required. This must be taken up not just in the work of the IPCC, but also in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge. 

**Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required.**

100 years ago, after the oil banker barons took over public credit, they took over public education and healthcare and corrupted them completely. Nuclear power was corrupted at least 60 years ago. The Rockefellers and Carnegies were the robber barons who started it with eugenics research and public libraries way back when books were a thing. Academics don't like to discuss academic fraud, so they call it a conspiracy. How much more proof do you need that we are destined to collapse if we don't disabuse the pigs proles and plebes of greed.

Nuclear power could have saved earth from us, instead all we got are depleted uranium bullets everywhere. We don't have time for inclusive points of privilege. We gotta do something that's real. We gotta stop believing in trips to Mars, transhumanism, 5G etc or earth dies.

There are 10,000 studies that say wifi and cell radiation harm life, yet we are putting 5G stations every 300 feet in cities. It's harming birds and bees. You don't need to be a scientist to know this, but you'll be labelled a conspiracist. To all my knowledge, this stuff is true.

Hear me out: Anti-science rhetoric needs to be publicly shamed the way socially unacceptable behavior is now shamed,"Ok this is easily the longest thing I've ever written in my short time on Reddit. No edits, just a brain-dump of thoughts. Happy to reconsider / revise with constructive input.

Here in the US, at least, I feel like we've done a fairly good job in recent years with effectively shaming away socially unacceptable behavior: ""gay"" can no longer be used as a synonym for ""lame"" or ""uncool,"" while ""body shaming"" is actually recognized as a thing. Racial/sexual/etc prejudices, while decidedly still sadly commonplace, are at least called out and reprimanded with far greater frequency -- and amplitude! -- if only thanks to the reach of social media: people absolutely need to think twice before they talk or share material on their social accounts, or they literally risk losing their jobs, and a permanently tarnished reputation in the public eye.

So while we obviously still have a long way to go to a truly civil, equal society, these seem to be steps in the right direction. And so my suggestion is that we start to do the same thing with decidedly anti-science rhetoric, too. Simply put, when people/journalists/news outlets make anti-science claims about, say, climate change, they need to be vehemently called out on it and publicly shamed for the world to see. When people/journalists/news outlets perpetuate flat earth / moon landing / anti-vax garbage, they need to be mercilessly reprimanded in the public eye.

Simply put: If a simple comment can get somebody fired from their job because it's now deemed offensive/racist/sexist/etc, then somebody should be fired from their job for perpetuating false/fake/anti-science.

The purpose of this is two-fold:

(1) We have a civic duty to upholding the integrity of science inasmuch as we have a civic duty to upholding the integrity of society's well-being; and

(2) To ensure that non-scientists (i.e., laypersons) can have no further influence whatever on science-based law/policy/etc. (Stated rather differently, science must drive policy; not the other way around.)

If it sounds like I'm suggesting something a bit drastic, a bit draconian, yes, I am: I think that it should effectively be ILLEGAL -- or at least invalidated or socially unacceptable -- for non-scientists to have any direct influence on matters of law/policy that require, or are otherwise dependent upon, rigorous scientific study.

In simpler terms: Unless somebody is a scientist, then they should have no right to influence matters of science or policy dependent on science; meanwhile, those who interfere with, disparage, or otherwise impede science, or help to perpetuate the dissemination of anti-science rhetoric, should lose their jobs and risk potential legal action for interfering with a scientific matter as readily as they would for socially unacceptable conduct.

Crazy? Maybe... but then, nobody thought saying ""dude, that's so gay!"" was offensive even just 10-20 years ago (depending where you lived). It was a pretty common phrase even at my high school in the super-liberal SF Bay Area. But say that at your workplace today, and you will indeed likely lose your job. As you should.

The state of our environmental crisis to too severe to tolerate anything less than an absolute eradication of such complete and utter scientifically illiterate poppycock which at best will hinder the drastic measures needed for our world's survival, and at worst, condemn us to a world crumbling under the stresses of mass population displacements; climate catastrophes from biblical flooding to decades-long droughts and excessive heatwaves; species eradication; crop failure; crime; and, likely, an eventual military state where countries resort to martial law to keep what modicum of society can be maintained.

Just as wearing a seatbelt in a car was once ""uncool,"" today it's just plain brain-dead stupid not to wear seatbelt. Similarly, what was once the realm of ""tree hugging hippy"" mentality to ""save the earth, man,"" is now an indisputable, decidedly real thing already affecting us today, and it must be dealt with accordingly.

"Climate change denying politicians are losing power, lets pull their supporters away from them!","[https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/](https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/)

It is imperative that we speak with conservative and independent voters about just how dangerous climate change is, because the evidence is becoming less and less deniable and the politicians attempting to deny it can no longer use the same arguments they did years ago. Their greedy motives are becoming increasingly obvious to the conservative voters that were once loyal to them. We need to take advantage of this!

What we need to realize is most republicans that didn't believe that climate change was real in the past 50 years held that belief because the media and politicians they listen to hid and still hide the truth for them. Now climate change is becoming increasingly undeniable with the overwhelming visual evidence. We need to approach conservative voters and give them the grim truth about climate change. Tell them their children's future is in danger if they keep voting for these climate change deniers. Tell them that the politicians know that climate change is real, they just pretend it's not a problem because they're just greedy old men. Climate change is an issue that has the power to break many conservatives loyalty in the politicians and media they once listened to. Even if you don\]t convince them to vote for someone who will take action, you may break their faith in politics enough that they don't vote at all, which still takes away a vote from conservatives.

More importantly think of it this way, if only 5% of the 64% of those republicans care enough to take action, that 5% could be very important in convincing the other 59% to take action.

For example think of a mostly republican neighborhood, it's sort of an echo chamber where the same opinions are held throughout the community. You're friends with one of those neighbors, you respectfully debate with them about climate change and you win him over by talking about his clild's future if we don't take action. Without ever entering this conservative neighborhood, your words created an advocate for climate change in a place where nobody cared about it. The man you talked to has the respect of the rest of the neighborhood, therefore they can spread the news about climate change in a neighborhood that once refused to even talk about the environment because they thought it was a ""liberal only"" issue. This neighborhood was once 100% conservative and didn't believe in climate change at all. Your friend managed to convince many of his neighbors that climate change was at least real. Before he talked to the neighborhood 90% of them were ready to go out and vote for trump and other climate denying politicians, but now only 50% are passionate, 25% are indifferent and 25% no longer have faith in them.

This example was simply a hypothetical. Obviously not every person we convince will be this effective at convincing others, but that being said there is also the chance you can convince somebody that climate change is important and that person becomes an extremely active advocate for the cause.

TLDR ;

This is a topic that I will continue to talk about to my fellow climate activists throughout the 2020 elections because I feel that many of us tend to ignore our conservative neighbors. When advocating for climate change action, it is imperative that we do not limit our discourse to just fellow progressives and environmentalists. Conservative voters are becoming increasingly aware that climate change isn't fake. We can use this fact to our advantage in taking down the climate denying politicians who are losing their influence due to the evidence of climate change!

Use Trump and other climate denying politician's policies against them when talking to republicans voters about climate change. Tell them that their clildren's futures are in peril due to the denial and inaction of the politicians they once were loyal to. Tell them that they never intended to make america great again, they just wanted to kill it and milk it for all it's worth. Trump doesn't care about you, he only cares about himself. Tell them that his charismatic rhetoric was only to win them over, and that it's not too late to reverse the damage he's done.

San Francisco International Airport to Ban Use of Plastic Bottles From August 20,"There is good news when it comes to sensible use of plastic. [San Francisco International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport) is  going to ban the use of single use plastic bottles starting from August 20, 2019.

Airport Spokesman Doug Yakel is hoping vendors will adhere to the move and that penalty would not need to be levied on them. However, it is worth noting that approximately 4 million plastic water bottles are sold per year at the airport. 

Thank fully, SFO vendors have already been using compostable single-use foodware, including to-go containers, condiment packets, straws and utensils.

This is a holocaust but they are also forcefully impregnated over and over again.

we should do all we can. Eating everything else is so easy to do, and it's constantly getting better and easier. Think about it as part of the solution instead of thinking it as the only solution. The more measure we take, the better.

Some people just cannot be bothered to research about climate change, not to say it is not important but because it's not directly effecting them just yet. 
I personally try and educate myself about climate change, but majority of the time all I keep hearing/ seeing is the effect of climate change on our planet and not a lot of, do this and do that if you want to help. There's a lot a finger pointing and not enough of ""I'll do my bit to help"".

We don't have enough time left in the world to convince everyone that global warming is a real issue, but at least if we can get as many people on board by taking action voluntarily/ involuntarily - I think it would be much better.

To be clear, research should be accelerated in fusion should the government in the next budget, to the tune of at least NASA's budget(but raise that too). Fusion is the ultimate answer but it needs some time.

Would you be interested to know which restaurants around you are environmentally sustainable?,"Hi Reddit, I have recently launched a competition and a website ([Athenum.io](https://athenum.io/) ) to understand how restaurants can be more sustainable for the environment and support local economies. And when I say restaurants it is in the broadest sense, including cafes and takeaways too.

As a company we want to evaluate businesses by how sustainable they are to the environment using data, and we are starting with restaurants as that includes complex supply chain that can be hard to see as a customer. I believe that simply changing the individual habits will not be enough to solve the pollution and climate change issues, but the businesses need to be accountable and do their part as well. Creating incentives for the businesses to adopt sustainable practices could help more than just shaming them. And I am sure that many people would care about having lower impact on climate and chose to purchase sustainable services and goods especially if that doesn't compromise the quality of experience.

There is no end to climate change. We need to re-think the problem.,"There is no end to climate change. There are no engineering solutions for that. People advocating for a stop on climate change are doing this because they are uneducated about the issue, they know nothing about power production and consumption, and what is worse of all: they're bad at physics. They don't know, how ""solutions"" for the problem work. And because of this, they don't know, why those ""solutions"" would not work. They only do this because of fashion. You are automatically considered a bad person if you're not an advocate for environmental protection. They are often hypocritical, either not caring about nature by themselves, or not donating anything to environment protecting organizations. They paint all the critics as the environment hating nonscientific bigots as if critics are enjoying wasting more of their money on fuels, because well, they just hate the environment, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Now that is bad for an environment. How about wasting 5 million euros on a solar roadway, which is actually bad for the environment, but very-very fashionable ""green new thing""? Nobody listened to the engineers.  

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a way to go. We need to face it: global warming will continue, sea levels will rise, developing countries will produce CO2 more and more, and protests will not stop it.

There is simply no engineering solutions for that. Ignorance about how power generation works will not help the matter. Hysteria will not help the matter. Reducing emissions in first world countries by even a significant amount will not help the matter. Especially if we do this by moving production to developing countries.

PSA: Companies will not meet goals to go plastic free or use all recycled plastics by 2025,"I work as a plastic pollution activist having worked for large public and private organizations internationally tackling the plastic pollution issue. Companies are freaking out about this problem due to consumer and media push back about all of the non recyclable plastics they are constantly pumping out and which we (for the most part) have no choice in participating in everyday resulting in a scary cost to our environment. 
Consumers have had it and have made it known that we want to see these corporations make changes. Ive worked with these companies and some of them do care and want to change most think the solution is to make bold claims that they are going to reduce plastics in their packaging or make their products 100% recyclable by 2025 or divert all their wast from landfill, etc. (you catch my drift) without understanding the implications of these statements. 
This is the thing, they don’t realize (I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt) that this is not possible at the moment in our current landscape. Recycling is about profit and currently there is no market for non recyclable materials and because the majority of products created today aren’t curbside recyclable and the ones that are have a high contamination rate, the amount of recyclable material for purchase is pretty small. Therefore, it can’t be scaled for use in 5 years like all of these large corporations like Unilever, Nestle, PepsiCo, P&amp;G, etc. are excitably claiming. 
SO what is going to happen is 2025 is going to come around and people are going to realize these companies have made no true progress and their commitments were all just a marketing ploy. 
My point in all of this is to say, to make REAL change companies have to commit to using less complex material components (I’m talking mono layered plastics) and there has to be a HUGE investment in recycling by our government and the private sector. Right now most plastics used are in flexible packaging that has ZERO value. The value of that material does not offset the cost of collecting and recycling it so the only way it can be recycled is by having a brand pay a premium for it to be recycled, So companies need to invest in simpler materials that can be curb side recyclable. 
Remember folks anything, and i mean ANYTHING, can be recycled, it just boils down to economics and what the value of that material is.",environment,1565063647,Jennypotatoe,1,2,True,2019-08-05 23:54:07

If You Want ‘Renewable Energy,’ Get Ready to Dig
Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of plastic.
By Mark P. Mills
Democrats dream of powering society entirely with wind and solar farms combined with massive batteries. Realizing this dream would require the biggest expansion in mining the world has seen and would produce huge quantities of waste.“Renewable energy” is a misnomer. Wind and solar machines and batteries are built from nonrenewable materials. And they wear out. Old equipment must be decommissioned, generating millions of tons of waste. The International Renewable Energy Agency calculates that solar goals for 2050 consistent with the Paris Accords will result in old-panel disposal constituting more than double the tonnage of all today’s global plastic waste. Consider some other sobering numbers:A single electric-car battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Fabricating one requires digging up, moving and processing more than 500,000 pounds of raw materials somewhere on the planet. The alternative? Use gasoline and extract one- tenth as much total tonnage to deliver the same number of vehicle-miles over the battery’s seven-year life.
When electricity comes from wind or solar machines, every unit of energy produced, or mile traveled, requires far more materials and land than fossil fuels.

 every unit of energy produced, or mile traveled, requires far more materials and land than fossil fuels. That physical reality is literally visible: A wind or solar farm stretching to the horizon can be replaced by a handful of gas-fired turbines, each no bigger than a tractor-trailer.
Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of nonrecyclable plastic. Solar power requires even more cement, steel and glass—not to mention other metals. Global silver and indium mining will jump 250% and 1,200% respectively over the next couple of decades to provide the materials necessary to build the number of solar panels, the International Energy Agency forecasts. World demand for rare-earth elements—which aren’t rare but are rarely mined in America—will rise 300% to 1,000% by 2050 to meet the Paris green goals. If electric vehicles replace conventional cars, demand for cobalt and lithium, will rise more than 20-fold. That doesn’t count batteries to back up wind and solar grids.
Last year a Dutch government-sponsored study concluded that the Netherlands’ green ambitions alone would consume a major share of global minerals. “Exponential growth in [global] renewable energy production capacity is not possible with present-day technologies and annual metal production,” it concluded.
The demand for minerals likely won’t be met by mines in Europe or the U.S. Instead, much of the mining will take place in nations with oppressive labor practices. The Democratic Republic of the Congo produces 70% of the world’s raw cobalt, and China controls 90% of cobalt refining. The Sydney-based Institute for a Sustainable Future cautions that a global “gold” rush for minerals could take miners into “some remote wilderness areas [that] have maintained high biodiversity because they haven’t yet been disturbed.”
What’s more, mining and fabrication require the consumption of hydrocarbons. Building enough wind turbines to supply half the world’s electricity would require nearly two billion tons of coal to produce the concrete and steel, along with two billion barrels of oil to make the composite blades. More than 90% of the world’s solar panels are built in Asia on coal-heavy electric grids.
Engineers joke about discovering “unobtanium,” a magical energy-producing element that appears out of

 nowhere, requires no land, weighs nothing, and emits nothing. Absent the realization of that impossible dream, hydrocarbons remain a far better alternative than today’s green dreams.

Buying a house on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska," Hello,

I'm an Alaskan who lives on the Kenai Peninsula, an area popular for salmon and halibut fishing. I absolutely love it here and have chosen this as the place to raise my family.

As I shop for houses I can't help but wonder: ""what's going to happen here over the next 30 years?"". As far as I can tell rising water levels aren't a huge concern but the increase in water temperature and potential damage to the fisheries will be. Obviously signing a 30 year mortgage in a place where the economy is tied to a natural resource might be a risky move.

I'm wondering what this community's thoughts are around this? On one hand I think: ""if all the fish in the ocean die then we're going to have some pretty big problems in the world and Alaska is probably the place to be when that happens"". On the other hand I worry about investing in a home and literally getting stuck with a house I can't sell as the fisheries start to die and then ending up in financial ruin towards the end of my working years.

Charting Collapse: How Fast And Complete,"The Potsdam Institute recently said that if our carbon budget were to increase 50%, we would only gain 10 years time to reduce emissions. Conversely, if our carbon budget were to shrink 50%, we would have to reduce emissions 10 years sooner than we hoped.

https://youtu.be/poHNsxbgHig ( 5 min )

Then, a few days later, Michael Mann came out and said that our carbon budget for 1.5 C has just shrunk by 40%. But, Michael Mann will turn around and say we still have hope, nothing could be further from the truth.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-heatwaves/think-the-heatwave-was-bad-climate-already-hitting-key-tipping-points-idUSKCN1UN065?il=0

Below is a chart showing how fast we must cut emissions to 0% to stay under 1.5 C. As horribly unbelievable as this chart was, it was produced in 2014, before we found out our carbon budget was shot all to hell. What this means is that we must reduce emissions at least 50% in 10 years, and 100% in 20 years. This is impossible because our energy supply has never varied from economic growth by more than 3%. We are essentially asking people to destroy the world economy. This will never happen, 100% guaranteed.

For a visual aid depicting how impossible it is, I've included a chart showing where all our energy sources come from. That little tiny green sliver at the top of the chart is renewable energy. It represents roughly 3% of total world energy use. In other words, it would have to displace the other 97% of energy use in 20 years. This cannot be done, and is literally impossible.

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/energy-sources.jpg

Our fossil emissions in 1990 were about 22 Gtons/yr, by 2000 they were about 24 Gtons/yr, by 2020 they will be about 40 Gtons/yr. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emissions2.jpg?w=696

By looking at the chart above, you can see if you are 30 years old, fossil emissions have increased nearly 100% in your lifetime. We've been pretending to fight climate change since 1990. 

Since 1990, we came up with 4 world treaties to combat climate change. Those treaties are not worth the paper they're written on. They are lies used to stall real action. If we had started real reductions in 2000, we wouldn't be facing the horrible collapse we face now.

In the most under-reported story of this century, Hans Schellnhuber says that runaway hothouse earth gets triggered anywhere between 1.5 - 2.0 C. Runaway hothouse cannot be stopped or reversed once started. The previous sentence is the visceral essence of complete and total collapse.

In the last 10,000 years, humans and livestock have destroyed 98% of land vertebrate species biomass. Our green crop fields are so poisonous, they kill all birds, fish, frogs and insects that come within miles of them. There are so many poisons in the biosphere that all vertebrate species are rendered biologically emasculated, feminized and infertilized.

Mass extinction is preceding runaway hothouse chaos. Within this century our oceans will become super saturated with carbon and destroy most of the plankton on earth. In other words, earth won't be fine without us.

This next chart will vividly show you why the US and Europe do not matter anymore. What this means is that AOC, Bernie Sanders and socialist fantasies in America will have as much effect on emissions as renewable energy, which is to say none. I would like Tulsi Gabbard to be president, and Bernie Sanders to be vice president. I'm just saying while it may matter a great deal to you, it won't matter to earth. We can always make things worse than they are, but we won't make them better than they are. That time has come and gone.

https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/potn-pao120518.php

&gt;A study suggests that as temperatures rise future climates could be analogous to past climates from Earth's deep history. Climates from Earth's deep past may provide analogs for possible near-future climates, but past and projected future climates have not been quantitatively compared. Kevin Burke, John Williams, and colleagues compared mean summer and winter temperatures and precipitation projected for 2020-2280 CE to those from two historic and four prehistoric warm periods spanning the last 50 million years. The authors found that Mid -Pliocene climates, 3.3-3 million years ago, replaced historical precedents as the best analog for future climates after 2030 CE. Under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stabilize by the mid-21st century, Earth's projected climate stabilized at Pliocene-like conditions. Under an unmitigated emissions scenario, global climates began to resemble those of the Early Eocene, 50 million years ago, by 2150 CE. In the latter scenario, up to 9% of projected climates had no close analog among any of the past climates examined. Both Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerged initially in the continental interiors and subsequently spread outward.

So what exactly was that climate like then for earth?

&gt;The heat and humidity of the early Eocene epoch made it a heavenly time for dense jungles and rainforests, which stretched almost all the way to the North and South Poles (the coast of Antarctica was lined with tropical rainforests about 50 million years ago!)

https://www.thoughtco.com/the-eocene-epoch-1091365

Basically the tropics moved north and took over entire continents. It was hot hot hot everywhere, even in the north. The thing is though we have cities where in the past these jungles took over. So instead of tropical jungles taking over, many cities (especially close to the equator) will simply become unlivable. 

I think going UP is smart, as in living above 5,000 ft or so as that will give relief from the heat and the flooding.

Air conditioning is set to boom. The global stock of **room** air conditioners will rise by an additional 700 million units by 2030, and 1.6 billion by 2059.

Better energy storage + renewable resources model shows significant reductions in both carbon dioxide emissions AND energy lost from solar and wind--new study that could help states reduce their impact on climate change,"Interesting: The researchers looked at the power grids in California and Texas, then modeled the ways in which energy storage might make better use of energy from renewable sources — and the ways in which storing energy from renewable sources might affect the amount of carbon dioxide the energy grid pumps into the atmosphere.

They found that in California, without energy storage, one-third of the renewable energy could be lost or never collected in the first place. And adding energy storage technologies — batteries and the like — could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90 percent.

Under the study’s models, holding energy from renewable sources also made the system much more efficient: Just 9 percent of renewable energy was lost.

In Texas, a state that generates a smaller percentage of its energy from renewable sources than California, the researchers found that adding energy storage technologies to the grid could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 57 percent. Under that model, just 0.3 percent of the renewable energy in Texas’s system would be lost.

We plan to hold ANIMAL AGRICULTURE and FISHING INDUSTRY accountable for the immense environmental damage they cause,"It is time for the **animal agriculture and fishing industry** to MAN UP and call it as it is - they **destroy nature** at a scale no other human activity is even capable of. **Ecocide, deforestation, desertification, biodiversity annihilation, soil erosion, extinction of species, reckless land grabs, depletion of oceans** \- all of these are caused by destructive agricultural and fishing practices that are incompatible with any aspirations to bring human existence on this planet to a sustainable level (*as a reminder, planetary overshoot day happened two days ago*).

We are a new decentralised volunteer organisation, **ANIMAL REBELLION**, based on the principles of Non-Violent Direct Action and we are planning to lead over 10k of volunteers and activists to a major action in London, UK (*in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion*) to challenge animal agriculture and fishing industry in the UK and after that other countries.

This is a one of a kind opportunity for environmentalists and animal rights activists to work together (overcoming any differences) to strongly challenge the governments to redefine the current food production system (*e.g. end animal agriculture/fishing industry subsidies, slash agricultural impact on climate change, stop oceans depletion*)

 

**WHAT?** We will go out on the streets and exercise our human right to a peaceful protest and civil disobedience (*think Suffragettes, civil rights, Gandhi*). We will demand the system change and we will educate people about veganism in the process.

**HOW?** By joining forces with about 20 animal rights organisations and also influencers and celebrities and in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion - a successful environmental movement that attracted a lot of attention to the issue of climate crisis and obliteration of biodiversity. It is acknowledged that fighting climate change and reverting biodiversity loss is impossible without changing agricultural system on the land and fishing practices on the sea.

**WHERE?** Initially in London, UK, but other countries have also expressed interest in aligning their actions!

**WHY?** Because these are the most destructive activities on earth you can think of.

**WHEN?** 07 October will be the start of our two weeks of protest.

“She spreads her wings and laughs at the horse”, penned over 4000 years ago regarding the ostrich running into open spaces faster than an equestrian. Sadly, the Arabian ostrich went extinct in 1973. What else occurred in that year pertaining to animals, and what possibly hindered many creatures? The U.S. under Nixon compiled a list and created the Endangered Species Act in 1973 (which excluded animals used for space exploration). Unfortunately for our environment the dollar dropped in value significantly, experiencing an inflation rate of 3.93%. A space station was launched and sadly dogs were killed, in addition to cats, mice, fruit flies, monkeys, turtles and rabbits. Has anyone researched the study of space exploration and the impact on the environment and its biodiversity? The Yom Kippur war was fought and this resulted in the rising gas prices especially in the U.S. What happened in 1973 was compacted by the declaration of peace in 1975. What happens when people feel peace is upon us? They become more complacent, relaxed, they let their hands rest at resolving major global issues like healing the environment. I am looking for a list of species added to the Endangered Species list in 1974 and there apparently are ZERO that were added that year. In conclusion, I am saddened, yet, not surprised that when there was a start to something wonderful it got thwarted the very next year. “‘There is peace! There is peace!’ when there is no peace.” Jeremiah wrote.  What are the odds that whenever we declare peace we have none? It appears that this verse is most true, in this, people, governments, and religious entities declare solutions to harmful conditions and we find ourselves smothered in failure and disappointment that can compress our bosom like a pulmonary embolism.

Kick-starting my career in the environmental sector!,"I'm reposting this from r/GetEmployed because I didn't get much feedback, I'd be so grateful for any advice you have to give me !

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

I (24F) am seeking advice on how to kick-start my career in the environmental sector. I have an international bachelor's degree in political science and a masters in political sociology. I would like to dedicate my career to the transition towards a more environmentally friendly society. Currently based in Paris, I'm struggling to get a graduate job because of how the system works here. France offers a wealth of super specialised and varied courses preparing you for specific careers. I'm struggling to enter the French market because I studied abroad and have a more unusual background than other applicants. My dream is to move to the south of France but jobs are more scarce so that project may have to be put on hold for a while. I'm open to moving abroad and will consider any opportunity.

I've been looking for a graduate job for over a year now (I've been working a temp job in the meantime), and realise that perhaps the problem is coming from me not knowing *what* type of positions I should apply to. I lack the scientific background to work on the technical aspects, but have many other qualities. I best see myself working in advocacy but do not know *where* to apply, despite countless hours of researching and dozens and dozens of applications. I am a good writer, have strong administrative skills and am a hard-worker who genuinely cares about our planet. I'm literally open to any position that is intellectually stimulating and will help me evolve in the environmental sector be it in sustainable energies, conservation, corporate social responsibility , waste management etc.

I would love to hear anyone's experience and how they got their foot in the door and any advice you have to give!

Have a lovely Monday,

Runaway Mass Extinction + Runaway Ocean Acidification + Runaway Land/Sea Methane Emissions + Runaway Human Population,"10,000 years ago, humans and livestock were 0.02% of land vertebrate biomass, today we 98%. Humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinction during Holocene, most of it in the last 30 years.

http://www.futureearth.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_blog_image/public/articles/great-acceleration.jpg?itok=-11Nrb2U

The oceans are acidifying 10X faster than in all earth's history, and when they reach a ""critical threshold"", ocean acidification will explode 100X faster than now, killing all sea shell creatures in its wake. These micro-shelled creatures form the basis for food on earth. Life on land depends on life in the ocean. Ocean acidification makes it harder for phytoplankton to absorb nutrients. We need phytoplankton to breathe.

http://news.mit.edu/2019/carbon-threshold-mass-extinction-0708

http://www.planetexperts.com/ocean-acidification-toxifying-phytoplankton/

Micro-plastics in the ocean are killing the plankton that produce 10% of earth's oxygen.

https://futurism.com/the-byte/plastic-killing-bacteria-oxygen

And that's just the oceans. On land we have destroyed 98% of the mega-fauna on earth and replaced them with cows. There are 25 billion chickens on earth.

Germany's green energy miracle is so completely fraudulent as to defy description. Here's just one example: They burn over 60% of their recycling refuse. They like about car emissions. Their forests are dying, and they're moving whole villages to get at some the dirtiest coal in the world.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/germany-recycling-reality_n_5d30fccbe4b004b6adad52f8

The Insurance Journal recently said we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 3° C by 2100. Claire Fyson of Climate Analytics says the same thing. Stefan Rahmstorf says we have to cut emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2° C.

Here's the problem, 2° C on earth is the equivalent of the critical threshold danger for our oceans. Hitting 2° C will trigger five major feedbacks, which will trigger 8 other major feedbacks, leading to runaway mass extinction and runaway hothouse climate catastrophe. 

Here's the really, really bad news: even if we managed to increase our carbon budget 50%, we would only gain 10 years to cut emissions. But there's a flip side to this because arctic methane emissions are not modelled, and will likely cut our carbon budget by up to 50%, meaning we will have 10 years less to cut emissions. Arctic methane from sub-sea clathrate and tundra thermaklasts will combine with unreported human methane emissions and sink the boat

But it gets worse still, because we are slamming headlong into runaway mass extinction *ahead* of runaway hothouse climate change. Both runaway hothouse earth and runaway mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once they tip past that critical threshold. There's no guarantee earth will recover. But it gets worse.

We have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to save the planet, otherwise ocean acidification will go into overdrive and reach mass extinction escape velocity, but China will not even begin to **significantly** reduce emissions until 2030 at the earliest. But it gets worse. Emissions have to go down **significantly** now, not 10 years from now. China has recently cut solar production 40%.

**If the IT sector were a country, it would rank 3rd in energy use, after China and the USA**

The 4 main sub-sectors to IT are: 1. devices 2. networks 3. data centers 4. manufacturing.

Data Centers: Used 21% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Google uses 16 data centers to run 40,000 searches/second.

- Data centers used 320 Terra Watt Hours (TWHs) of energy/yr in 2012.

- 320 TWHs of data center energy use was 2% of total energy use in 2012.

- Streaming video is projected to increase data center energy use from 2% up to 13% of total energy use.

Networks: Used 29% of total IT energy use in 2017.

- Network energy use increased from 219 TWHs, in 2007, to 354 TWHs in 2012.

- 354 TWHs could power 32 million US homes for 1 year.

- Network energy use is growing 10% / yr.

- Steaming will grow to 80% of internet traffic by 2020.

Devices: Used 34% of total IT energy use in 2017.

Manufacturing: Used 16% of total IT energy use in 2017.

**The Potsdam Institute on the IPCC Special Report:**

https://youtu.be/poHNsxbgHig

To stay below 1.5 C we have to cut emissions 100% by 2050.

To stay below 1.5 C we can only emit 420 gtons C02 total.

Even if we managed to change the 420 gton budget by 50% up, or by 50% down, we only get 10 years more, or 10 years less time to cut emissions 100%.

If methane emissions increase enough to  shrink our carbon budget to 220 gtons, then we have to cut emissions 100% by 2040 they say.

Mass extinction not included.

I think this means if we don't cut emissions 50% in 10 years, we'll never make it. Emissions will go up between 10-15% in the next 10 years.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

After 30 years trying, solar and wind are &lt; 3% of total world energy use.

How much plastic garbage does humanity produce?,"Every year, mankind throws 300 million tons of plastic waste. How to understand a lot or a little? Let's try to compare with something well known.

One ton of compressed plastic waste covers an area of ​​247 cbft, from the total volume you can make 74.1 billion garbage cubes of 1 cbft.

To transport these cubes, all trucks in the United States (there are 2.47 million trucks in the United States) will need 10 times.

If you build these cubes in a line, it will warm the earth 563 times and pave the distance from the earth to the moon 58 times.

They can completely cover the surface of Manhattan 8 times and fill 2000 Empire State Building.

If this continues, ordinary plastic packaging will destroy us.

Add your comparisons in the comments. When typed enough I will make a large trash gallery of humanity.

"Wow, it's a real scorcher out there!","Wow, it's a real scorcher out there! 

&amp;#x200B;

Guess what? Every summer, for the rest of our lives, is going to be the hottest summer its ever been. Eventually, most of the winter will be spent trying to figure out how to survive summer. And then, some day, we won't.

&amp;#x200B;

As I understand it, there are difficult technical problems we must solve to stop global warming. These are not easy problems, and may not have solutions. If we were able to dedicate humanity's resources toward solving the technical issues, then, maybe, we'd be able to solve it and stop it. It's hard. It would take a lot of work. But, possible.

&amp;#x200B;

But we don't have all of humanity's resources behind it, and there's a good reason. The reason is fascism. As Madeline Albright describes in ""Fascism: A Warning,"" fascism thrives in an environment of uncertainty and fear.  She writes that, for example, in the early days of Hitler's rise to power, when he was the head of the Nazi political party but not yet in government, as the German economy improved, the fascist party lost support, and when the German economy then started to veer back into depression, the fascists gained power. Fascism thrives when there is fear and uncertainty, because that is when people are most open to a strong leader with simple answers who defines enemies who can be made to be the fault of all hardship. When times are tough, fascists gain support.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, there is no better environment for fear and uncertainty than global warming. It's going to cause increasing amounts of disruption, death, and destruction everywhere: the perfect environment for a fascist. If you're a fascist, you want to help this along, not bring it to a close.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the state of play, then, as I see it: the fascists are in power, and unless we stop global warming, it will only get worse, which makes an environment better for fascists. The fascists don't need to do anything to make global warming worse, they just need to run down the clock.  When the effects of global warming become obvious, instead of ignorable as they are today, the fascists have a new threat to rally their troops against: Look at what the immigrants or leftists or elites or gays or whatever are doing to us now, they can yell, and solidify support as it gets worse.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it. Checkmate. They win, we lose. All that's left is to tip over the king, say ""good game,"" shake hands, and fold up the board. We're not going to survive this.

Activists Block Montpelier Intersection in Show Against Enbridge," 

Hoping to call attention to the subject of today's Public Utility Commission hearing, members of Extinction Rebellion Central VT early this morning blocked a State Street intersection (at Taylor Street/Governor Davis Avenue) as part of their efforts to get the PUC to reject a petition by Noverco Inc. to acquire a controlling interest in Vermont Gas Systems, Green Mountain Power Corporation, and subsidiaries of Green Mountain Power Corporation. 

**A multi-layered corporate structure is at the heart of the issue.**

Noverco, Inc., which operates as an oil producer based in Montreal, indirectly owns 71% of Énergir, L.P. , the main distributor of natural gas in Québec. 

Énergir, L.P. is involved in developing renewable, liquefied and compressed natural gas, solar and wind power and hydroelectricity. Formerly known as Gaz Métro and a diversified energy company, Énergir, L.P. also, through its subsidiaries, operates in nearly fifteen states, where it produces electricity from hydraulic, wind and solar sources. It's also the leading electricity distributor and sole natural gas distributor in Vermont. In 1986, Gaz Métro acquired Vermont Gas Systems, which distributes all the natural gas in Vermont, and, in 2007, it acquired Green Mountain Power, which distributes 70% of the electricity in Vermont.

A complex restructuring in 2010 resulted in Énergir, L.P capital being held primarily by Noverco, a private company controlled in part by investment firm Trencap, public pipeline company Enbridge, and the public energy company Valener.

**Activists reject the idea of a pipeline company having greater ownership in local utility companies.**

The ""regenerative culture"" activists want the PUC to ""reject the petition to buy out the public shareholders in Énergir, increasing Enbridge's ownership stake in in VGS and GMP to nearly 40 percent."" They hope to ensure Vermont remains less reliant upon fossil fuel and note that Enbridge is being sued by the Michigan attorney general, who called its dual oil pipelines in the Great Lakes an ""unacceptable risk.""",environment,1563899736,LocalVermontNews,0,2,True,2019-07-23 12:35:36

Hi everyone.

I'm a bit nervous to post to such a huge audience.

*Why bamboo?* Bamboo grows faster, can **absorb more carbon, create more oxygen, and yield more hardwood** than an equivalent stand of trees *within 10 years*. And you don't have to kill it when you harvest it, so it's great against soil erosion. 

Grow more trees and leave them be, but as a lot of you know, we  don't have the time to wait 40-70 years for them to mature. We can grow bamboo quickly and to replace construction materials, plastics, fabrics, charcoal and more in less time and **without the damage of deforestation**.

*Why an app?* I recognise that a lot of people want to make a change but just don't know what to do, or feel they don't have time. So I thought about how I could turn an easy everyday action (how many times do you open a new tab every day?) into a powerful tool to do good. *I know ads suck*, but not compared to 4-6º degrees of warming, right?

It's read to [add to Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bambeere-%E2%80%94-the-browser-ta/hdiiakgcahadnmkfhhbbjeaiibhocena) and I've *almost* got the Firefox version ready and working.

*How much does it cost?* 

**The app is free.**

I'm currently making working out details with sustainable ecologically-focused bamboo plantations in South America and North Africa and roughly put it's about €6,000 per ha for a 5 year managed growth that pays fair wages to local worker and within a year I want to have at least 10ha in the ground as a pilot scheme which means **€60,000/$70,000 needs to be raised fast**.

If **10,000 of us ad this extension**, in one year we will *just about* reach 10ha. If 100,000 of you do it, we'll be there even quicker.

Once the [bambeere.org](https://bambeere.org) website is finished, I will publish transparent reports about money raised and how it's spent.

Value of Water,"  
How water gives meaning to life  
A thirsty thought understands the need for water, when we are born, all we know is to drink water, let the water flow through our eyes, in the form of tears. Tears are a medium to represent our life’s most exciting moments, be it joy and happiness, or love and sorrow. Starting from having a bath in a tiny tub of our size, to our luxurious showers, we haven’t learned the fact that with our current approach we will either sink in it or will die looking for it. Science may have taught us the life cycle of condensation and evaporation but didn’t teach us how to ride that cycle, how to have a piggy bank for it and keep it in our basket. H20, is just a formula for water, for us now. Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water and all major cities are sooner or later will join the quest to doom 

  
Have you ever kissed the droplets of dew, and try not to drink it?   
It is said that one should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, to be healthy and fit. But have you ever wondered the thirst and need of our mother earth for pure water to accommodate all of its children per day? Per week and month?? And so on! We used to get punishments in school when we didn’t do our homework right? Exactly, the same situation is right now. We forget to do our homework, to water the plant, to see it grow. Where is the excitement? To water, the plant is to nourish our mother nature. In return of doing nothing, natural disasters are the punishment, not for just us, but to other innocents too on our behalf. Imagine a world, where we get an instant return for what we do. Forex. We plant a tree; we get the fruit the other day. We water a plant; it rains at the same moment. It would have been a blessing, right? So, patience is what, we are losing. Being a mother is a feeling, which everyone says only a mother can understand. But I say when you plant a tree, and water it daily, watch it grow, who will the most hurt person, to watch it die one day? The love for nature has no birth and expiry date. It's free, it’s an elixir for life. When our eyelash falls on our cheeks, the first thing we do is take it carefully on our hand, close our eyes and make a wish. And blow it in air, but have we ever thought what if our wish stays with us, and lashes got just carried away by the wind, what if the receiver never receives the message? The same way a lot of people are wishing for a healthy planet, silently and it’s our turn to open our eyes and let it happen. Imagine a home of fish, or a crocodile or a turtle, they are nearly homeless these days,   
In textbooks, we came across to “water water everywhere, nor a drop to drink”; isn’t it’s becoming true?   
Okay now let me take you back to the time when elites had the giant pools, and queens had the most luxurious bath of the time; and when their gardens were flourished, their ponds were full of fishes and many more. You might have a question now; when they never thought of saving water, then why should we?? The answer lies in the stories itself, what they took from nature, they returned it in an acceptable form to it, and what we are doing is, we want the purest form of water, use it, spoil it, make money, and never care where does that water go.

"Educational: I'm an MD and I've developed a free mobile app, to allow my patients to calculate their personal risk of cancer, which includes the links between cancer and various environmental factors. If any of you are interested, feel free to try it.","I'm a radiation oncologist, so I obviously get many questions about all aspects of cancer. I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes numerous environmental factors and pollutants. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

This is our only hope..,"B the title I might come off with an excessively nihilistic vibe, but I must admit this is weighing heavily on my mind lately. I understand it is extremely difficult to change anyone’s beliefs, but time is running out and we simply cannot afford to give up. I know a good amount of my friends and family at this moment do not believe in climate change, but I will not be apathetic. We have to try. This is the most important issue we are facing on earth and we are running out of time. I’m just here to say this so if all else fails, I can rest knowing I tried. So here goes...

Everyone I know personally who believes in climate change doesn’t talk about it. Maybe we are scared. Maybe we don’t want to think 20-50 years into the future. My question is how much does it hurt you to educate others? How much have you actually researched into this topic, apart from people’s opinions that share your same viewpoints? I am guilty of this. We need to educate others, but also empathize and understand them. We need to donate to research. We need to commit to changing the entire way we consume energy and food. We need to reduce, reuse and as a last resort, recycle. Once it becomes common, it will be normal. We just have to start changing the way we live today.

Climate change can no longer be a taboo topic based on your political beliefs. We must be able to discuss this at work, at home and with friends and family. We must set the influence. Pick up after others, talk to our city officials about what can be done to help locally, but do not give up.

I am a firm believer of altruism being a powerful influence. If we can empathize with others we may be able to persuade them. We can’t expect to change minds by fighting with them. We MUST set a positive example. No more us and them. We are all humans and this will affect us all. It is only about what is most important: Our future. Generations ahead will thank us. Imagine how proud they will be when they read the history books and see how we solved certain extinction. If you have kids, do it for them. The world needs to hear our voice of concern, but it must be heard with the best intentions. And it MUST be relentless.

 Please share this or share your own thoughts. Share on your social media. I don’t care, just put it out there, guys. It doesn’t cost anything. Let others know that believing in climate change does NOT put into question whether God exists or not. It does not make anyone less of your political party to believe in this. It just means you care about this planet and every human, plant, animal and drop of water on it.

Is it too late to do anything to save our planet and restore it? What can we actually do?,"Come on. In the next 10-15 years, 35% of our coral reefs will be gone. We have already lost 20% of our coral reefs, meaning within 15 years we will likely have lost half. Big deal, its only coral right?

Two thirds of the air we breathe is produced from coral reefs, more than the rainforests, and it takes hundreds of years to grow, under specific conditions. It is extremely sensitive to changes in pH and heat, which an increase in CO2 does - increases ocean acidity and temperature, meaning the ocean can absorb more CO2. It is being lost at twice the rate of the Amazon rainforest, takes longer to grow (mm a year) and produces more air.

A huge amount of marine species rely on them for life and so do many land organisms, yet they're just being destroyed. 9 of the last 10 years have been the hottest on record. Today in Britain it is expected to hit 39, hottest day on record. On average 200 species go extinct EVERY DAY, 1000x the natural rate.

Yet somehow some people still don't accept it. Vast swathes of land are being turned into more housing for more people who just waste resources and pollute even further. The air in China and India can be as bad as smoking 65 cigarettes a smoggy day and a pack a day when it's not smoggy.

50% of all sea turtles died last year, alone. A truck load of plastic ends up in the ocean every minute. Coca Cola produces 100 million tonnes of plastic every year for their bottles. That's just one company.

20K Trees Planted for Agroforestry by Women’s Coop in Rwanda,"We’re thrilled to announce the completion of an incredible agroforestry project in Rwanda in which 20,671 trees were planted by a women-led cooperative called Jyambere Munyarwanda.

The goal of this project is to restore agricultural systems to improve productivity, community livelihoods, and environmental sustainability.

The tree planting was carried out in Rutsiro District, Mukura Sector, with participation from 200 volunteers. Most of the trees were Grevillea Robusta (pictured below), a species preferred by farmers in agroforestry, used in planting with food crops because it is relatively fast growing and does not compete too much with other plants for water. The other tree type was tree tomato, which is exactly what it sounds like, an edible fruit tree. 

Overall, 380 acres were newly planted with these trees, which will be well cared for over time by the farmers who manage the lands.  About 4,000 additional trees will be planted here in the spring as a final part of the project, which will add lemon and avocado trees to the mix.",environment,1564068793,yeehawecostore,4,14,True,2019-07-25 11:33:13

The Ecology of War and Energy,"**Rated G:** for general audiences

Power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand -- Tolstoy

Power comes from the control of energy.

Oil made Wall Street banks powerful.

Private banks stole public credit 100 years ago.

Modern civilization is 100 years old. ie - phones, cars, planes etc.

Capitalism, Communism, Propaganda, Feminism, Organized Crime etc. as we know them today are all about 100 years old.

These things have been around forever, but were all writ large with the advent of massive banks, mass propaganda, mass electrification, mass transport etc. All came into their current forms because of advanced technology. 

All our technology came from oil 100 years ago when robber barons of the gilded age stole the credit and currency of the citizens of the United States.

The lust for power from oil, and the fear of loss of power to communism took over the US 100 years ago. We are so far removed from  that time that most people do not know about the history of when modern civilization began.

The birth of bank power happened at the same time communism was born, which started a war, which fueled a boom, which led to a bust, which led to a war... etc. etc.

Power, energy, propaganda have driven the the boom-bust-war cycle 3 times since 1914, through 3 world wars. 

The 3rd world war started in 1990 as a kinder, gentler war, and in 2001 turned into the sadistic forever war of today.

The big banks bought out communist China 50 years ago.

When a Canadian clock manufacturer started sending jobs to China in the 1950s, it was the beginning of the end for western civilization. By the 1970s, Canadian ceramic souvenirs were made in China and shipped to Canada, for sale to US tourists.

China is now king of the world. Both the US and China want Muslim oil. This means war. That war will heat up in August.

The Guns of August -- The Automatic Earth

https://www.theautomaticearth.com/2019/07/dulce-et-decorum-est/

The boom-bust-war cycle is inexorably reaching its logical conclusion, the biggest boom-bust-war of all time.

The only thing that is stopping China from complete world dominance is oil and computer chips. China imports 90% of its computer chips from the US.

We are at the very beginning of the bust cycle. German and Chinese banks are stretched out beyond their limits, at exactly the time when humanity faces food and water shortages.

The 2024 collapse of civilization was predicted 50 years ago.

The only thing we know different now is that we are going to kill all life on earth faster than anything earth has ever seen. 

It took the dinosaurs 13,000 years to die off, we're going to make the asteroid look like child's play because we have ignited an explosive plankton die off event in our oceans.

We have also triggered a massive die off because humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinctions over land.

The petro-pharm-chemical wipe out of biomes on land is causing runaway infertility. We are killing and poisoning everything too fast for life on earth to cope.

The atmosphere on earth is not a permanent thing and I fear we are accelerating its demise. Physicists say that we may hasten the end of air on earth, and that the vacuum of space will descend to the ground sooner than we like to imagine.

Our socio-economic ideologies are not designed for shortages.

What this means is that we have to redefine money, power and energy, which is easy to do because we don't even know what money is. The only way I can even imagine how to do that is to tax wealth and pay 100% of it back in a universal basic income. This will never work because both socialists and capitalists want control, or power, over that money.

We have the solution but not the will to do what must be done.

"A Trillion Trees Could Save the Planet: Scientists have always speculated about how trees can help end the current climate crisis, but the question has always been how many.","[A new study from the Crowther Lab](https://crowtherlab.pageflow.io/trees-against-climate-change-the-global-restoration-and-carbon-storage-potential#215076) out of Swiss University ETH Zurich, has finally come up with an answer: 1 trillion more trees on Earth could sequester more than 60% of anthropogenic carbon emissions.  


**See The Power of Trees**

It has long been understood that trees and forests remain the best strategy humanity has for cleansing our atmosphere of the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, a key driver of global warming. Other technology like direct-air capture or CO2 separation have proven to be comparatively ineffective and far exceed the costs of just planting more trees.  


In their study titled *The Global Tree Restoration Potential*, Crowther Lab determined our planet could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree coverage. With current global tree coverage sitting around 2.8 billion hectares, that means Earth could sustain 1.6 billion more hectares of forest. 

Of those 1.6 billion hectares, Crowther Lab discovered just under a billion hectares, excluding land occupied by agriculture and cities (about 1 trillion trees worth), inherently suitable for supporting reforestation efforts - that’s a land area almost the size of China.

Researchers [created a map](https://www.crowtherlab.com/maps-2/) that is the “first ever quantitative, spatially explicit map of the Earth’s tree carrying capacity.” They mapped global tree coverage (among many other metrics) and, most importantly, were able to pinpoint where planting trees would not only be feasible but the most beneficial to tackling “the problem of atmospheric carbon.”

May seems a bit doomsday or too exaggerated.

All based on fact by respected professors, lectures and people not employed by the government to give a watered down version to scare people,

""We are facing an unprecedented global climate emergency. The government hasfailed to protect us. To survive, it's going to take everything we've got."" is there statement. We won't survive unless we are rich but i like the optimism. Some quick facts to scare the shit out of you:

""18 of the 19 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001"".............as predicted at higher frequency at higher temperatures and so on.

\- The mention of ""it is the Earth's cycle""......2000 years worth of records and examples such as the little ice age from 15th to 19th century................the brief warming from 950 to 1250 CE.........unfortunately no records can be matched to the rapid speed of change happening right now.

\- Increasing population, increasing infrastructure, deforestation, rapid insect and animal depopulation.

\- Permafrost melting in Greenland and Siberia and melting quicker and quicker as the sea starts to retain heat from the lack of ice to reflect the suns rays

.-......One of the many nails in the coffin but a big one. Melted permafrost releasing multiple gigatons of methane into the atmosphere causing runaway climate change.

5 Reasons Why TerraGreen Supports Renewable Energy?,"  

![img](s7mpr0rkw6b31)

• It is safe, abundant, and clean to use when compared to fossil fuels. 

Even clean-burning natural gas is at a disadvantage to what renewable energy sources can provide. Enough sunlight comes down on our planet every day that if we could harvest it with solar panels and other forms of collection, we could power everything for an entire year. Because wind is created by the warmth of the sun, it is also virtually limitless. Fossil fuels, in theory, are a finite resource because of how they are created.

• Multiple forms of renewable energy exist. 

Diversification within the renewable energy sector has exploded since the 1970s. From dams that provide hydropower to solar strips that are strong enough to handle the weight of a vehicle and can be turned into roads, we have numerous methods of creating power through the collection of renewable energy. There is greater diversity in this sector when compared to fossil fuel resources.

• It provides the foundation for energy independence. 

Many nations rely on fossil fuels for their society to function under the “modern” definition. These fuels come from a handful of countries that work to control pricing and availability. By developing renewable energy resources, countries can work toward energy independence with a diversified portfolio of energy to access. Although these resources take time to develop, it should be remembered that the current fossil fuel infrastructure has more than a century of development behind it.

• Renewable energy is stable. 

When renewables are creating energy, the power produced is stable and usable, just like any other form of “traditional” power. It is a dependable resource when an infrastructure is available to support it. Jobs are created within the sector as well, creating stability within local economic sectors at the same time. The power created can be distributed through existing grids, which can limit installation costs for some communities.

• It is a technology instead of a fuel. 

Coal must be mined and refined to make it useful. Natural gas must be released and transported. A fossil fuel is created from natural resources, whereas renewable energies are created thanks to the use of technology. For this reason, the pricing of renewable energies will continue to go down as improvements in technology occur. Fossil fuels can see price reductions through mining and refining efficiency improvements, but there will always be an underlying labor cost that will affect pricing and availability.

Which is worse: 3D printing or bitcoin?,"Hi. I am facing a decision on which I need some advice.

I am currently working in two jobs. One is a company that manufactures and sells 3D printers (the type that prints from plastic filaments). The other company makes money by running a bitcoin mining pool. I'm looking to only keep one of those jobs, as it would be somewhat more practical for me. I'm wondering which one of those two jobs is less unacceptable from ecological standpoint. Intuitively I'm leaning towards 3D printing being less bad, since bitcoin (esp. bitcoin mining) consumes ridiculous amounts of power, but it's kind of hard to say and there are multiple factors in play.

There's of course the third option of ditching both jobs and finding a more eco-friendly one. This might be an option but it's a longer-term goal and I need to make this decision rather soon.

If bitcoin and 3D printing are comparably bad, then I suppose I can just pick whichever is more convenient in other respects and keep looking for a 3rd job as I go.

The administrators of Thailands’ Facebook groups as well as their internet forums don't want trouble from the authorities so they actively remove all discussions about it.

Green Energy,"*How Green Energy and EVs Will Drive Humanity Over a Cliff*
By 2050, there will be at least 2bn cars on the world's roads. If all of those cars were EVs, annual production of neodymium and dysprosium would need to increase by 70% and stay at that level until 2050. On the same basis, annual copper output would need to increase 100%, and cobalt output would need to increase by at least 250% to meet global demand.

The increase in renewable energy infrastructure needed to provide power for EVs would also consume more metals and minerals. Wind turbines require a lot of steel, while solar panel installations consume several scarce minerals, such as high purity silicon, indium, tellurium and gallium. Extracting the minerals themselves is also a power-hungry process, adding to demand.

https://www.petroleum-economist.com/articles/midstream-downstream/power-generation/2019/ev-revolution-could-stall-due-to-mineral-shortages

Demand for copper, for example, could rise by 275 to 350% by 2050, according to academics at Yale University. The World Bank estimated in 2017 that action to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C from pre-industrial levels could mean a seven-fold increase in demand for cobalt and an 11-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2050.

https://www.ft.com/content/4863fff2-8bea-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972

The current EU target is to ramp up production of Electric Vehicles 200 times by 2030. But, here’s the thing – this would lead to an increased demand for production inputs of cobalt, lithium and nickel and copper to build the electrical vehicles. However at 100 times the demand world cobalt resources would be exhausted in 8 months, lithium in 5 years, nickel in 4 months and copper in 5 months.

Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet Inc’s Nest thermostat and Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today.

The Future of Electronics May Depend on Deep Sea Mining for Minerals

https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/deep-sea-mining-metal-resources-advanced-technology-devel/

If, as the IEA predicts, there are 125 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030, it will require roughly 10 million tonnes of copper – a 50% increase over current annual global copper consumption (20 million tonnes).

The additional wind turbines built by 2030 would require roughly two million tonnes of copper – about 10% of the world’s current production.

That’s not even taking into account how much copper would be needed for a quadrupling of solar power, and all the enhancements to the electrical grid and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles that will be required.

Given how much aluminum, metallurgical coal, copper, aluminum, zinc and rare earths are required for each wind turbine and each EV – and how much lithium and cobalt are needed for EV batteries – it begs the question: Will the transition to a low-carbon economy lead to “peak metals” (the point of maximum metal production)?

The targets that governments are setting for themselves for electric vehicle and renewable energy adoption will require a massive increase in mining, and there’s some question as to whether the new mines required can even be built in time to meet the demand according to the timelines being set.

https://www.mining.com/global-energy-transition-powers-surge-demand-metals/

Rare earth metals are used in solar panels and wind turbines—as well as electric cars and consumer electronics. We don't recycle them, and there's not enough to meet growing demand.

Climate change and the bible,"Living in Cardiff, I love going out to Cefn Onn Park and reminding myself of what nature feels like. When I am somewhere beautiful, I see myself attempting to absorb every detail. I try to hold in my mind that particular shape of the mountainside or the cloud formation. That way, I can carry the beauty back with me to my semi-detached suburban home. Which can be re-conjured, when the concrete jungle gets a bit much. 

It seems unimaginable to imagine the emptiness that existed before creation. Yet, so easy to ignore its daily wonders. To connect with the creation I must forget the concrete city behind me. I try and remember God formed the earth from the void which now keeps me alive. I have to remind myself that everything I eat, what I drink, the air I breathe all comes from the earth. It’s to easy to be ignorant and believe that my food, water and clothing comes from the shop. I forget seeds have been planted, crops pulled out of the ground. People then store, preserve, package and process these crops. The food is then transported to the shop and shelved for our consumption.

I love nature and forget the world is sacred and sustaining, precious and in need of protection. In fact, I use and consume it, trample over it, without taking the time to consider what impact my actions have. 

As God’s creation formed in all its meticulous glory, he ensured that it was good.

Sometimes in Cardiff, we experience bad weather, the heavy rain feels endless at times. On rare occasions, the weather can get so bad that a power-cut may be experienced, or local flooding of the River Taff. I am very grateful that I was fortunate to be born in a developed country. When these disruptions happen they tend to affect the majority for a few short hours until someone comes out to fix the problem.  

However, in less developed countries, settlements can be located on floodplains. When extreme weather strikes this can have severe consequences such as loss of life, spread of diseases and being left homeless. These people would then have to live in resettlement camps.

Its sad that circumstances of where you are born will heavily dictate the level of fortune or misfortune you will receive in life.

Because of the changing climate, flooding, droughts and unpredictable weather conditions are certain to become a regular occurrence. This will lead to more hunger, poverty, displacement and even conflict. Millions of people already living in vulnerable communities will be forced from their homes and become climate refugees. 
  
God separated out the land from the water; however, his perfect ordering of creation has been disrupted. While it can be hard to see how our everyday actions lead to such catastrophic shifts, the evidence is clear: the temperature of the earth is changing because of man-made activity. We can’t fix everything overnight, but we can start today by taking action to reduce our carbon emissions and tread lightly on the earth. 

For me food has always been plenty, and readily available. Today I look forward to finding a new recipe online and then producing the meal for my family and me to enjoy around the dining table as we listen to each other talk about their day.

In some parts of the world such as Africa where crops have failed and the food is sparse, it must be difficult for a Mother, when their children ask ’What's for Dinner?’

These settlements where crops have failed would have once had rivers flowing through them, have now dried up. 

All over Africa, the climate is changing; unpredictable weather conditions are causing havoc with harvests and leaving communities that will struggle to survive.

There are many sceptics of climate change, I don't believe it was Gods design to have oceans full of plastic, he ensured that the planet was good so that we could thrive and live a good life. The polluting of the oceans and the pumping of carbon emissions, into the atmosphere, has all been done by ourselves. However, the sceptics preach that this is natural. 

God gave us a self-sustaining planet that could provide plenty for all, we must respect the planet and work hard to keep it in healthy condition that will provide for our future generations.

Genesis 2:15 “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it.”

Revelation 11:18 “The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”

Genesis 1:26 “Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

Proverbs 27:18 “Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored.”

Numbers 35:33“You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.”


Psalm 24:1 “A Psalm of David. The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein

God commands us to maintain and care for the earth, but God’s edict to have dominion over the earth doesn’t mean to have complete domination and exploitation of it, but sadly, this is what has happened; we continue to rape the land, denude the forests, strip-mine the hills, burn through the resources, and gut the earth.

THE FALL OF EACH TREE COUNTS !,"  

THE FALL

Approximately billions of trees are cut down every year and each one of them falls with a story of a lifetime.

The tree you pass by on a daily basis has seen decades and it knows about you, your family, your history, your behaviour better than you because it has witnessed you cross by, it has seen your father and grandfather come across it. Like you hundreds of families have enjoyed its shadow, they have breath the fresh air provided by it and tastes the sweet fruit of its patience. That tree stands tall with pride of doing this well fair for us but as we all are aware of the fact that humans re not the best creature to return the favour to the environment. We hardly account for 0.1% of the total number of creatures of this globe but we account for 99% of habitat destruction.

With the fall of every tree falls a story of a seed which was nourished by nature to give its best services to all creatures who depends on it. That bud turned in to a sapling which has to grow against wind and wrath of bad weather, sometimes it had held its nerve with ragging drought and it hold us during floods. Nothing could have demolished it growth but then came us the humans who very ungratefully cut down these creatures for our survival regardless of understanding that they at first place were ensuring a pleasant habitat for us.

How does it feel to get berated when you have done something for someone and they don’t even acknowledge it and very ungratefully treat you, don’t you feel the anger of destroying their ego and teaching them how to respect if not returning the favor and that is a very basic of reacting to it hopefully trees don’t feel the same way or we all would have seen the apocalypse and we will someday with the pace we are being destructive towards the hand which provides us with our food, water and air and these three are the most important factors of survival and with one common source we hold the power to relish their production but we see otherwise. With the same approach, we will be standing on any port in the storm and nowhere to run but we humankind learn by mistakes, not by claims and being a gambit, we will allure the likes of our doom’s day.

This cries out just because one tree falls and I relate sentiments to it. No, it is because billons of such stories are falling each year and we are part of these stories. Every civilization is embarked with the cultivation they were around and we remember them for the world they left us but are we doing as good as we are supposed to do?

Stop Blaming Individuals for Climate Change," The people of today’s world have been given overwhelming evidence that our environment is slowly being destroyed. The individual American is constantly implored to recycle, buy eco-friendly products, and donate to organizations campaigning for the well-being of our planet. It is clear that we need to make a change if we want our environment to be sustainable, however putting the weight of said change on the solitary consumer is preposterous. The primary cause of environmental decay comes from multinational corporations and companies practicing hazardous operations. Shifting the blame to the consumers is an unethical method of avoiding responsibility for the harmful actions of these companies.

While having individuals take measures such as switching to eco-friendly energy sources and reducing consumption of plastic, meats, and mass-produced items would have a positive impact, it won’t be enough. Even if every citizen of this country were to recycle, it would make a very small dent in ecological impact compared to what massive industrial monopolies are doing.

I'm currently debating someone on Facebook who posted a picture that had a dead bird next to a turbine with the caption ""If this bird was covered in oil I bet it would make headlines"" and I bottom lined him and told him that birds hitting turbines is an issue that's already being addressed by professionals and until viable solutions come up that can be applied to existing wind turbines it's kind of just a cruel byproduct. Fortunately however wind turbine designs have surfaced that are much more avian that are hopefully implemented in new construction. However from this little exchange sparked an interesting debate about the ethics of green energy with all the bird casualties. I asserted that birds will generationally become more acclimated to the existence of wind turbines and adjust their migratory paths and actively avoid wind turbines much like deer have generationally adapted to the existence of roads and consequently adjusted their habitats and routines to minimize road casualties.

Humans are unregulated parasites. And there is no escape to this fact. Not even if you live as a secluded tribe in a forest.,"**Definitions of parasite :** 

*  In evolutionary biology, parasitism is a relationship between species, where **one** organism, the **parasite**, lives on or in another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life (quick [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism))
*  An organism living in, with, or on another organism in parasitism ([webster #2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parasite))
*  A creature that lives off another organism is a parasite. The parasite might not hurt the host, **but it doesn't do anything to help it, either** (nice one from [Vocabulary](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/parasite))
*  Some one who sponges everything out of you even your last breath given have the chance (sometimes a little [UrbanDictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=parasite) is fun)
* Organism obtaining nourishment from or living one another organism (the 'host') for survival and **usually harming it and causing disease**. Some parasites are independent and some depend entirely on their hosts **and separate only when either one of them die (**[Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/parasite.html), not kidding)
*  An organism that obtains nourishment and shelter on another organism ([Biology Online](https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Parasite) Two biologists giving info)
*  Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship, or long-term relationship between two species, where one member, the parasite, gains benefits that come at the expense of the host member. The word parasite comes from the Latin form of the Greek word *παράσιτος (parasitos)*, meaning “one who eats at the table of another”. (Awesome one ! Found [here](https://biologydictionary.net/parasitism/). It gives many parasitism variants. Check it out (always with caution, it is not in the top 10 of google search, maybe it hsould be (/s added for intentional purposes)
*  **Parasites** are plants or animals that live on or in a host getting their nutrients from that host. A **host** is an organism that supports a parasite. Sometimes the host is harmed by the parasite, and sometimes the relationship is neutral. But the host never benefits from the arrangement. When the parasite does have a negative impact on the host, it doesn't often kill the host directly, but the stressors that come with having parasites can kill. (from [study dot com](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-parasite-definition-types-examples.html) go to the study transcript, locked by registering for the full access... sorry)
* Some might fancy the term ""leech"" (parasitic/predatory organisms) to be more appropriate. But some have been used as positive!.. Humans never.

 I avoided all sources from sites defining social parasites : ""a lazy person who lives by getting money, food etc from other people"". Humans social parasites are also an effect of sapiens parasiting even itself.

Humans are parasites, on an evolutionnary and planetary scale. They pray on their environment without giving back, for they are aware now (let's say since tool age) they must be the prevalent specie on this planet. No compromises.

A powerful parasite that doesn't want to die, but still unaware of its host, even in low populations tribesthat will feed on nature but will struggle to prevent nature feeding on them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Means used** : 

Google search in English (that skips a lot of information, i am aware of this)

Browsed +-200 results, skipping the social parasites as referred on many sites (humans taking advantage on other humans, any scale) skipping human hosting parasites as a disease, skipping the definitions in other languages, skipping some lost tribes that **also modify their environment** to fit their needs and would do the same if tools were found/provided, skipping technology that 'could' save sapiens (see futurology with their illusions, see ""the plans that we'll never see"" if you are not filthy rich, [see the world in 2000 seen by people in the 1900](https://www.laterredufutur.com/accueil/il-y-a-100-ans-les-artistes-etaient-invites-a-imaginer-le-monde-de-lan-2000/)) Look for ""technology will save the world"" omitting the millions of death to save the few, see also people trying to be better but posting their accompmishment using high end non renewable tech with cloud computing.

Make Arbor Day an International holiday!,"The holiday exists in countries all around the world: [list of countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbor_Day). There's infrastructure and citizens and a proven track record of mass planting of tree's. 

&amp;#x200B;

But In literal and symbolic efforts to help curb climate change, we need to unify the day globally, so that the entire earth is committing to it at the same time. I especially like India's version, [Van Mahotsav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Mahotsav), which is a week-long festival. \*

&amp;#x200B;

I think a good goal to start would be \~ **10 billion planted a year**. That's everyone in the world (\~ 7.5 Billion)  committing to plant 1 tree +  companies and governments adding in another 2.5 billion. 

&amp;#x200B;

[That study](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/planting-1-2-trillion-trees-could-cancel-out-a-decade-of-co2-emissions-scientists-find) around using tree's to capture carbon said we need to plant additional **1.2 trillion trees**, which means it would take us 120 years to do it. It has to be quicker than that. So the idea would be moving the goal post up by 1 billion every year.  Someone better at math will be able to figure out what the number of years actually is, but I imagine it's below 50 (right?) 

\*Now I read that they do it in July because it's just before monsoon season (which [parts of India desperately need](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/asia/india-water-crisis.html) at the moment) .. it's possible that some locations aren't ideal on the same day ... but even symbolically, I think we need to all come together on this at this point.

"Meeting with Congressman, are there any qualified persons willing to peer review an article I'm presenting on 100% clean energy?"," 

I'm a college student from Washington State and after meeting with a conservative leader to discuss climate change reform, I got the excuse that 100% clean energy, despite there being a bill being passed for it, is a pipe dream in my state because we don't have sufficient battery capacity in any modern technology to support the power grid. I suspected that this was a well crafted deflection, a ploy allowing them to continue opposing climate change reform while pretending to support it, so I did a little research.

I found this article *Response to ‘Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems’*. It's a great article that refutes many of the arguments perpetrated by those who wish to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

I'm having a follow up meeting with him soon and would like to have my bases covered.

Nuclear waste,"Why is only like 8 percent of nuclear material used and the other 92 percent is waste. 

Have we not figured how to use 100 percent of it.  It can be converted all to heat or some other energy.  Matter can’t be created or destroyed but it can be converted to energy.  Yes or no. 

Shouldn’t we concentrate on creating things that can save and help the world or destruction is the only way to profit. 

Remember when appliances lasted a lifetime. Guess it’s better to make garbage so we can keep consuming and making waste.  

Everything should leave no waste no trace that we were ever there.  That is technology.  What we are doing lacks logic and intelligence.  Do you buy a bag of potatoes keep one throw out the rest.   Basically it’s what we are doing.  I have  seen ppl order meals eat 1/4 of it throw the rest out so I guess we have some wasteful ppl in the world.  No wonder it’s all screwed up. 

Capitalism and saving the environment can never work.  One demands making garbage constantly for profits which means a steady stream of waste.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti: “The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all… we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing”,"[https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/saikat-chakrabarti-2/](https://danfromsquirrelhill.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/saikat-chakrabarti-2/)

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti: “The  interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a  climate thing at all… we really think of it as a  how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing”

Saikat Chakrabarti is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff.

On July 10, 2019, the Washington Post [published](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/10/feature/how-saikat-chakrabarti-became-aocs-chief-of-change/) the following: (the bolding is mine)

*Chakrabarti had an unexpected disclosure. “****The interesting thing about the Green New Deal****,” he said, “****is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all****.”  Ricketts greeted this startling notion with an attentive poker face.  “Do you guys think of it as a climate thing?” Chakrabarti continued.  “Because* ***we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.****”*

It’s been said before by libertarians and conservatives that the  environmental doomsayer movement is like a watermelon – green on the  outside and red on the inside. Chakrabarti’s statement verifies this  claim.

In the 1970s, environmental doomsayers referred to their alleged  upcoming environmental apocalypse as “overpopulation.” In the 1990s,  they called it “global warming.” And now in the 2010s, they are calling  it “climate change.” In all three of these cases, the environmental  doomsayers have claimed that the only way to prevent these alleged  environmental disasters from happening is to have the government take  control over properly, resources, energy, the economy, jobs, and the  means of production.

Chakrabarti’s statement proves what many of us libertarians and  conservatives have known all along: for many of its participants, the  environmental doomsayer movement is just an excuse to massively increase  the size and power of government control over everyone and everything.",environment,1563143099,TeethX1975,4,8,True,2019-07-14 18:24:59

He continued to suggest that if Canada stopped extracting Liquid natural gas companies would just move to one of these less regulated sites. Is this true ?

How much would it cost to water a reforested mountain?,"When scarce rainfall in an area and quality of soil makes it difficult to consider successful reforestation, I was wondering how expensive would be to water newly planted trees until they are mature, and beyond. I've found online numbers from 30,000 litre to a quarter of a million litre to water a tree per year, which is understandable given the variation in soils, weather conditions and the requirements of each tree variety themselves. Are these numbers a good estimate? Maybe more to the lower end hopefully?  

Thinking of arid desert landscapes near the sea, if we used water from a desalination plant, which seems to cost from half a dollar to one dollar per 1,000 litre ([see this recent blog article](https://smartwatermagazine.com/blogs/carlos-cosin/evolution-rates-desalination-part-i)), we could water a tree from $30 to $250 a year. Let's say a tree takes 25 square metres in a reforestation plan. A (rather big) desalination plant can produce 500,000 cubic metres of water per day (180M m3 a year approx.) at the prices quoted above. With these numbers we can water from 700,000 to 6 million trees, that is from 18 to 152 square kilometres of newly planted forest, that would cost to water from $21M to $1,500M a year. This seems to be quite a lot, even at the lower end of money and higher end of surface/trees, but a few number to compare with: Central Park in NYC is three and a half square kilometres, Amazon profit in 2018 ($11bn) would cover costs for 75,000 square km of forest in a favourable scenario with my numbers, that is about the whole of Belgium and The Netherlands combined, or a forest of a hundred kilometres wide from San Francisco to San Diego.

Anyone here with experience in reforestation and cost of water, etc. that would like to confirm or correct these rough numbers?",environment,1563293065,herUltravioletEyes,1,3,True,2019-07-16 12:04:25

Introducing the Poster Project," 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PosterProject/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PosterProject/)

The poster project is a place where activists and artists can share their knowledge and skills in order to create powerful, emotional and impactful posters and designs in order to raise awareness to social issues such as climate change, injustice, corruption, equality, pollution, genocide and others.

Take for example an artist makes a poster to raise awareness about climate change in his hometown. The design is amazing and has strong emotional appeal to it, so he also shares it on his social media platforms as well, but he only has about 500 followers, so it doesn't get the attention he wanted it to. Now say he posts it to the Poster Project, it is upvoted through the roof and is the hottest post on the subreddit! Fellow redditors across the country can then print out that poster and hang it up in their towns as well, thus spreading the message that the artist wanted to share far further than just his hometown!

&amp;#x200B;

Artists and designers make the posters for activists and citizens to share to their communities and in turn the activists and citizens can provide stories that can inspire even better designs from the artists. All are welcome to the poster project!

Omnitopia: The Global Collective

An Outline for Our Sustainable Future

&amp;#x200B;

	The current situation on our planet is not sustainable. Our social and moral foundations are eroding beneath our feet and the damage done to our environment increases daily. If we are to continue to exist without destroying ourselves, the fundamentals and values of our society must be reevaluated and reformulated from the ground up. The list provided in this document is a general framework towards achieving this end. There are only two options that the human race is currently confronted with: change or extinction. One individual alone cannot easily change our society, but enough like-minded individuals, cooperating collectively, with dedication and hard work, can achieve this goal. The time has come to look past that which divides us and see how we can draw strength from our fellows. A human race that acts as one cohesive, indivisible unit is necessary for our own survival.

The Four Sectors of the Global Collective: 

Guidelines for Collectives and Individuals

&amp;#x200B;

	In order to create a society that is the antithesis of the one we currently have, a litany of changes are necessary. The most notable of these is a fundamental reformulation of the way our social institutions behave. Today’s institutions exist to preserve themselves and the status they hold within our culture. Institutions that are static, meaning that they resist change to stay in place and maintain control, are both inefficient and counterproductive. We need a set of institutions that are dynamic as opposed to static; a set of institutions that embrace change at every moment in order to become more streamlined and efficient as they evolve. The following is a list of suggested institutions for The Global Collective. These four sectors will replace our current political, economic, and educational institutions. 

Collective Guidelines

1.  Fundamental Education and Periodic Inquiry

	a) The institution of education will be considered the most integral part of the Global Collective. Groups of 	people will 	participate in the collective pursuit of knowledge. These groups will be led, but not controlled, by individuals with 	significant experience in the specific field of study.

b) In addition to study of specific fields of interest, every individual will receive the same degree of general education. The end goal of this general education is to cultivate individuals that are well informed, critically thinking, and inquisitive. 

c) Both groups and individuals will be encouraged to ask any questions they might have. Furthermore, at periodic intervals, groups will be asked to take a step back and ask how and why everything works the way it does. These groups will also be challenged to see if they can come up with any improvements or tweaks that could more effectively streamline a procedure or process.

2.  Resource Sustainability and Future Projection

a) Availability and quantities of resources will be updated in real time so that rates of usage never exceed rates of production. These updates will be automated to the highest degree possible.

	b) Levels of efficiency will be assessed and recorded so that action may be taken if a procedure or process is unsustainable.

3.  Constructive Cooperation and Analytical Diagnostics 

	a) Groups of willing and capable individuals will address and attempt to solve any societal problems that 	may arise; these 	individuals will do so under the guidance of the scientific method so that they will remain objective throughout the process.

	b) Problems will be analyzed as they arise. The root cause of dilemmas will be diagnosed when possible.

When the root cause of a problem can be determined, the solution should come from addressing the problem at its source; as opposed to addressing the symptoms caused by the problem.

c) Groups of people will be encouraged to examine problems from different perspectives. Analysis of problems from varying perspectives will provide fresh insight into different methods of solving problems.

4. Societal Integration and Dynamic Feedback

a) Groups of people will be encouraged to participate in recreational activities. These recreational activities 	will promote both the release of stress and the strengthening of social bonds between group members.

b) Open expression of thoughts and ideas will be encouraged in any and all arenas. Upon completion of any activity; educational, constructive, or recreational, the participants will be asked to provide feedback about 	the procedure or process.

&amp;#x200B;

Individual Guidelines

1. Comprehensive Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	a) Background information relating to desired goal is provided.                                                                                                                                                             	b) Instruction is given about how best to achieve said goal by individuals who have already done so.                                                                   	c) Instructors will answer all questions to the best of their ability.

2. Resource Management                                                                                                                                                                                                	a) Any resources or facilities required for goal attainment are provided.                                                                                                                       	b) Guidance and assistance are provided by experienced individuals.                                                                                     

3. Goal Attainment                                                                                                                                                                                                              	a)Time and effort are put towards desired goal, and either the goal is reached, or the individual falls short.                                                                                                                                                                                            	b) Future guidance is provided to individuals striving to achieve the same goal.                                                                                                               	c) If an individual’s goal is not realized, reasons are noted to assist other individuals in the future.

4. Expression and Feedback                                                                                                                                                                                              	a) Suggestions and feedback about the goal attainment process are provided; suggestions are noted and implemented if doing 	so is practical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	b) Any artistic or creative urges relating to the goal attainment process are encouraged to be expressed.

On the Maintenance of Social Equality

&amp;#x200B;

	Class differentiation has existed since the foundation of civilization, consequently, it is hard to imagine a world in which it does not exist. But, our society is rapidly transitioning out of the industrial age and into the technological age. If we are able to effectively phase into the technological age, the creation of a utopia becomes a realistic possibility. As technology continuously improves, eventually scarcity will become an outdated convention. In a world where scarcity is no longer an issue, goods are produced in enough abundance to be freely available. If goods are freely available and have no cost assigned to them, the means of class differentiation disappear. 

	In order for society to move past classism, society must also move past the definition of oneself by their material possessions. The importance our current society places on possessions is a product of consumer culture. Moving past the dependence on ownership of objects is essential to the maintenance of social equality. Admittedly, there are a lot of nice, luxurious things in the world. But, the bond a person has with an inanimate object can never come close to the comradery of life-long friendship. Real-world connections with others are what truly matters. Furthermore, a greater quality of life can be achieved by devoting one’s time to pursuing passions. This will create a greater degree of fulfillment than spending one’s life pursuing status symbols.

	The profit mechanism is the root cause of the majority of the problems our society faces today. Not only is it the source of the chasm between the upper and lower classes, but it is the cause of extensive harm to our environment. Some people would argue that competition for the sake of profit encourages innovation. But competition in the context of profit is counterproductive, because competing parties are only striving to be marginally better than their rivals. If a company were to make a significantly superior product than their competitors: then they may spend too much to produce it and not turn a profit. Furthermore, a vastly superior product that doesn’t become obsolete within a few years would put the producer out of business. Planned obsolescence goes hand in with cyclical consumption, and cyclical consumption goes hand in hand with unnecessary waste of resources. And lastly, the profit mechanism encourages harm to the environment. This is the case because practices and policies that have the least impact on the environment are often the most expensive. If a company can make more money by sacrificing the wellbeing of the environment, they will do so. The profit mechanism must not exist in a world that is to remain viable for human life.

	Many individuals find the root of their identity in their nationality. By no means is culture a crime, but at times national prejudices serve as a wedge that drives groups of people apart. Without the existence of nations, the separation of peoples into competing factions becomes more difficult, and the creation of collective cooperation at a societal level becomes more realistic.

	Religion, and the devotion to one’s personal God, is a very sensitive issue. But the fact that preference of one benevolent deity or another can oftentimes inspire deep seated hatred between groups of people, is concerning and unsettling. My hope for the future, as should be yours, is that people are able to look past their differences and put more emphasis on their similarities. By doing this, we will actually be adhering to the Golden Rule instead of deviating from it.

&amp;#x200B;

On Improving the Quality of Human Life

&amp;#x200B;

	In the Global Collective, Education will be the most fundamental part of our society. Currently, education is primarily geared towards preparing people to enter the work force. This means that all the resources and energy of educational institutions are spent grooming students to be active participants in an endless cycle of consumption. Learning solely for the sake of knowledge is a practice that is almost completely extinct in today’s world. The majority of people see knowledge or college diplomas as a means to an end; the end of having a good job and enough money to be happy. But this pursuit is a fallacy. True happiness can be found in the pursuit of knowledge and engaging in logical discourse with those around you. In the Global Collective, exchange of information and ideas is essential to the continuous improvement of our citizens.

	In the same theme of not defining oneself by their possessions, people will also not be defined by the luxury of the house in which they live. Housing situations will be both practical and pragmatic; never lavish or excessive. People will have the choice of living alone, in communes, or with family members. 

	The major emphasis of healthcare will be on prevention as opposed to reaction. A high degree of diseases and conditions that arise in today’s healthcare systems are easily preventable if there were more proactive measures in place, as well as a better mindset about health. A new healthcare system with a holistic approach to health and medicine will work best for both the providers and recipients of care. 

	Many people would argue that violence is an inescapable part of human nature, but I would have to disagree with this assertion. The only reason human civilization has progressed this far and become this advanced, is our ability to work cooperatively. There is still a lot of room for our improvement, and this improvement could be more easily accomplished if the broader societal mindset placed less emphasis on individuality and more emphasis on collectivity.

	The setting and realization of goals, as well as the expression of thoughts and ideas, are essential parts of leading a fulfilling life. Not only are these activities fulfilling, but they can be therapeutic as well. Active engagement with the people around us and the world around us will help to combat the recurring dysfunction that we see in the world today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Concluding Remarks and Hopes for Our Future

&amp;#x200B;

	Transforming our culture from one of excessive waste into one that is sustainable into the future will be a long and arduous process. But, it is a process that must be undertaken if we want to have a future to speak of. We are at a turning point as a species, and we must collectively choose either failure or success. Making sustainable living choices as an individual is a step in the right direction, but these choices can only go so far when the broader mindset is one of apathy and indifference. The beginning of this long road starts with informing the people around you that there is a better alternative to the way the world works. But this better alternative will never be realized if we cannot work together to change the status quo of our culture. As more and more people become aware of the state of dysfunction our current society is in, more and more people will have a thirst and desire for real, comprehensive change for the better. Eventually, as more people are awakened, it is possible that world governments, and not just individuals, would want to sign on to the idea of The Global Collective. When this happens, an interim federation of countries that agree with the ideals of The Global Collective can be formed. As momentum continues to grow, and a majority of countries join the federation, the realization of our goal is within sight. Once every country signs on and joins the federation, the federation will cease to exist and The Global Collective will be realized.

&amp;#x200B;

	The ideas set forth in this document are in no way intended to rob people of their individuality. They are instead a means to level the playing field from which people begin. Individuals in The Global Collective will not define themselves by the amount of money they have, the kind of car they drive or by the size of their home. Our citizens will be defined by the contributions they make to our society, by the original thoughts they share with others and by the positive effect they have on the world around them. Every person in The Global Collective will be encouraged to realize their full potential. Furthermore, within The Global Collective, dishonesty subversion and manipulation will not be seen as means toward obtaining an end. A broad shift in societal mindset is required. This can only be achieved with collective solidarity applied over the course of several decades. The end goal is the realization that your own well-being is not above and beyond the well-being of others, and that the well-being of our planet in its entirety is a necessity. You are a part of a greater whole, with a greater purpose; if the greater whole realizes its full potential, then all parts within that whole will realize their full potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

	The framework put forth in this document is far from perfect, but it is a significant step in the right direction. Eventually, this will be more than just a list of ideas on a piece of paper, it will be a way of life. The greatest requirement is the ability to act. If the propositions in this document resonate with you, I implore you to take some degree of action to help me expand this message. At the very least, take the time to discuss these ideas with a friend. To be more involved: Take pictures of this paper and share them with others or make photo copies of this paper and pass them out to others. If you desire change, do not fail to act; make the world a better place to the best of your own ability. The positivity you put out will return to you in one form or another.

&amp;#x200B;

	This document is overtly encouraging a revolution. But, such revolution can by no means be achieved through the use of violence. Violence is contrary to the ideals of The Global Collective. Any revolution involving violence would only lead to a continued repetition of past mistakes. We require a revolution to end all revolutions. We require a revolution to destroy the idea of social class. Our revolution can only be achieved through non-violent non-compliance. The best way to stop the system that is currently in place is by refusing to participate: we must collectively refuse to be a part of the endless cycle of consumption. The cycle of consumption only benefits those at the top, and we need a system that equally provides for all citizens. We will make our voices heard. Human beings are much more than cogs in a machine that exists only to reap vast profits from both the subjugation of the down-trodden and the rape of our mother earth. If all the small cogs of that machine collectively refuse to turn, the entire mechanism will come to a grinding halt. And, at this point, there is no other option. Our biosphere is rapidly approaching a level of damage from which it will be unable to rebound. It is fundamental to realize that all parts of our planet are interconnected. We all come from and return to our biosphere, and willful destruction of that biosphere is literal suicide. We, the silent majority that will no longer remain silent, choose life instead of death. We choose integrity and truth as opposed to dishonesty and subversion. We choose to invest in our future rather than to stagnate in our past. We choose to go forward hand in hand, side by side, instead of using the backs of others as stepping stones to the top. We choose an existence of substance, meaning and value as opposed to one of mediocrity, repetition and squandered potential. But, most important of all, We choose to do it together and not alone.

Planting trees is a good step, but we need to take better care of the oceans. 

Earth comprises around 28% land, of which half is rock, desert and  ice, so up to 14% is available for green plants. However, man is  continually destroying the plants upon which we depend for life.  Typically the continuing destruction of the rain forests of which 20%  has been cut down so far.

The ocean occupies around 72% of the Earth's surface and all of  this is available for the green oxygen producing plants, especially  phytoplankton. [Many sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton)  estimate that between 50% and 85% of the world's oxygen is produced by  phytoplankton although currently, an accepted value is more than 70%.

**A Conspiracy To Save Earth:**

---

Reddit’s collapse is just about the best link resource you can find. The downside is that they are extremely restrictive in terms of discussion. For instance, they discourage talk of collapse mitigation, and absolutely forbid gender dysphoria and child rape discussions in terms of collapse. It’s like having a shit sandwich forum, and forbidding discussion of shit.

It’s also the modern day, secular version of “holier-than-thou”. They view anybody who is not progressive — as they define it — to be evil. This means they view libertarians as Nazis. They’re a bunch of well meaning socio-fascistic dick heads — but other than that, they’re okay.

☭NN (CNN) did a hit piece on Assange. A real piece of fucking work. The Atlantic magazine says the Epstein child trafficking conspiracy is making people believe in, well… conspiracies. I remember not telling anyone, when I first put tape over my laptop. Nowadays, I wouldn’t be surprised if Google didn’t have nano-bug sniffers up my ass, eating their way to my brain from eating chocolate covered almonds.

Humans are too bio-chemically inefficient to power the Matrix. It takes more energy to keep us alive than we deliver over a lifetime. The desire to control the data in your head is a self-reinforcing, exponentiating driver of social collapse. 

In the old days, we swore oaths before death, now we click on Devilish terms of agreements. Transhumanism is a crime against god, not because of transhumanism, but because of our greedy, selfish nature.

Even our desire for justice is greedy, and selfish in nature. China has won, the socialists won, because we refuse to disincentivize them. The socialist SS war itself pays for the data war like an incestuous black and white tornado. Which is just a fancy way of saying we better tax the rich for ourselves, and only for ourselves, worldwide. 

It’s rich people ( grade 12+ ) who fly. Four billion people fly each year. That number will not go down 100% in 20 years. The sheer mass of inertial energy throughput guarantees it. You can’t stop giant oil takers on a dime. It takes them 11 miles to turn around. Socialism is too fucking slow, stupid and retarded to save a nickel.

Giving a feel to tons of CO2,"Hi All!

So i've been busy trying to find a usefull measure to compare tons of CO2 to. No one knows or has a feel for how much a ton of CO2 is, and i want to make it insightful/touchable.

I've tried using trees as a comparison. But trees are just too variable, and their carbon sequestering is usually measured over years. 

I want to be able to say that someone needs to plant X trees to compensate for a certain activity, or someone just saved 100mins of showering by not eating that piece of meat.

20 Positive Planet Stories From 2019 … A Report of Change,"Let's spread the positivity!

Now that the year is half-way finished, we can shed some light on all the good we’ve accomplished in 2019 and get inspired for the future! Here are 20 environmental achievements worth celebrating.

# 20 Feats Worth Celebrating

**1. Thanks to Brands, Reusables Grow**

With China’s [decision](https://interestingengineering.com/china-bans-foreign-plastic-sending-recycling-industry-into-a-spin) to stop accepting foreign recyclables, many countries were left with a backlog of trash – a reminder we need to look beyond the blue bin. [TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/) founder Tom Szaky knows “the garbage problem keeps getting worse and worse.” This is why TerraCycle announced a plan making single-use plastic a thing of the past.

In the near future, you’ll be able to order household items in reusable packaging. And once you’ve had your way, the packaging will be collected from your doorstep. 

The company’s new initiative, [Loop](https://loopstore.com/), is similar to curbside pickup except the packaging won’t be broken down … just used again! Names such as Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Unilever have already jumped on board agreeing to end disposable packaging. The future is now, and it flows in one … big … loop.

**2. The EU Took a Stand Against Plastic**

In March of 2019, a pregnant whale washed up on shore with 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. Sadly, the issue of plastic in our oceans is [only getting worse](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/dead-pregnant-whale-plastic-italy/). 

A recent report from the director of the Trash Free Seas program at the Ocean Conservancy stated, “plastics are now found everywhere in the world, throughout the entire marine ecosystem and food chain, from seabirds to sea turtles to seals.” (Nick Mallos) However, the [European Union voted](https://fortune.com/2019/03/28/eu-bans-single-use-plastic-items/) to ban 10 categories of single-use plastics – from straws and cups to plates and cutlery. The ruling should be in full effect within member states by 2021.

**3. NYC Schools Went Meatless**

Meatless Mondays! Mayor Bill de Blasio [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/us/new-york-meatless-mondays-trnd/index.html) that beginning Fall 2019, New York City’s public schools will no longer be serving meat the first day of each week. The reasoning for this move is to “keep our lunch and planet green for generations to come.” (Blasio)

The fact that kids in NYC are down to munch on veggie meals once a week is pretty cool! Plant-based diets are more common among young people. And with tons of [evidence](https://grist.org/article/the-planet-wants-you-to-stop-eating-so-much-meat-and-dairy/) that meat farming plays a large role in greenhouse gas emissions, they’re taking a leap towards a greener world.

But to answer your question … no … mystery meat Mondays will not be missed.

**4. New York Banned Plastic Bags**

To top it off with a final eco-friendly ban, New York has become the second state to [ban single-use plastic bags](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/plastic-bag-ban-.html). The legislation also allows counties to opt-in to a 5-cent fee on paper bags … revenue going to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund. In a statement released in March 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, “these bags have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways … \[the agreed plan will\] be a way to protect our natural resources for future generations of New Yorkers.”

**5. More Companies Turned to Regenerative Agriculture**

Reported by [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/), our soil can only handle 60 more years of traditional farming before it’s depleted. And according to Maria-Helena Semedo of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about a third of the world’s soil has already been degraded. This is why regenerative agriculture – a process which mimics how nature improves soil health and extracts carbon from the atmosphere – has become more important now than ever.

In 2019, General Mills [partnered with farmers](https://www.fooddive.com/news/general-mills-to-implement-regenerative-agriculture-on-1m-acres/549684/) to implement these practices on 1 million acres of soil. Other companies such as Hormel Foods and Danone North America have committed finances to regenerative agriculture. One company, however, has made the leap entirely. [Applegate Farms](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/applegate-bets-the-farm-on-regenerative-agriculture----launches-the-new-food-collective-300793736.html) released a new line of regeneratively made sausages “to show the world that raising animals and eating meat doesn't have to be a problem.” (John Ghingo)

**6. Polystyrene Was Left in the Dust with The Eco-Sensitive Cooler**

Polystyrene – more commonly known as Styrofoam – has been a popular material for disposable coolers … until now. It is quickly being removed from supply chains because of how toxic it is. Leading the trend, cooler company Igloo has released the[*ReCool*](https://www.igloocoolers.com/pages/recool#recool-product), the world’s first eco-sensitive cooler. Made from recycled tree pulp and paraffin wax, it is 100 percent biodegradable and can hold ice for 12 hours. It can also go five days without leaking water! After that, it can be recycled or dried out for reuse.

Although brands like Igloo have committed to reducing harmful packaging, when it comes to states, Maryland is ahead of the game! In March of 2019, the state Maryland became the [first state to ban Styrofoam](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-foam-ban-passes-20190403-story.html). What a win! 

**7.** **Burger King Goes Vegetarian**

Livestock farming contributes to 18 percent of the greenhouse gases worldwide, severely affecting climate change. Moving towards sustainability, Burger King announced its collaboration with [Impossible Foods](https://impossiblefoods.com/) to add veggie Whoppers in select stores. Dubbed the ‘Impossible Whopper,’ it’s made with plant-based materials to mimic the taste of meat … all without the pollution.

Would you like that whopper with or without beef?

**8.** **Ride-Sharing Went Green**

Topping off the push for renewable energy, earlier this year Lyft grew a green thumb. They announced an electrifying plan to invest in thousands of hybrid vehicles users can request when using “[Green Mode](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/2019/portland-green-mode).” Hand-in-hand with their initiative to make rides [carbon neutral](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-commits-to-full-carbon-neutrality-and-100-renewable-energy), this is another step to improving quality of life. A [company news release](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/2019/2/6/making-cities-more-liveable-with-electric-vehicles) stated, “replacing gasoline-powered cars with EVs is a significant step forward in our efforts to improve the quality of life in our cities.”

Humor me here! Click on your browser and search “Lyft CEO.” Is his last name a coincidence? I think not.

**9.** **All-American Blue Jeans Turn Green**

Do you want your jeans in blue or green? Turns out you can have both! Jeans have been around for so long that denim can be seen as natural. Sadly, it’s not … it’s actually [quite wasteful](https://www.ecowatch.com/environmental-cost-jeans-2544519658.html). The yarn used to make denim is pulled through boxes filled with 2,000 liters of indigo dye and water. Together, the boxes needed add up to the length of a football field. …You’d think there would be an eco-friendlier way to make one of the most popular pieces of clothing in the world.

As of June, Wrangler has broken this manufacturing tradition! Developed at Texas Tech, a new [streamlined process](https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Wrangler-promotes-sustainability-with-new-foam-dyeing-denim-process,1015403.html#.XSi6SehKiUl) emits indigo dye via foam. Called “Indigood,” the new method eliminates over 99% of the water from the dyeing process. Not only does this remove water waste from the equation, but it decreases energy use, too.

**10.** **Airline Makes it Easy for Passengers to Reduce Their Carbon Footprint**

Air travel is a problem highly [toxic to the planet](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/1/11/18177118/airlines-climate-change-emissions-travel). Amazingly, Edelweiss airline is making it easier for passengers to reduce their carbon footprint while they explore the world. The airline has an option for flyers to fly carbon-neutral, which also adds offsets to the price of the ticket.

How does it work? When you book a flight on [flyedelweiss.com](https://www.flyedelweiss.com/DE/Pages/home.aspx), their partner [MyClimate.org](https://www.myclimate.org/) calculates the carbon emitted during your flight. They also find the dollar amount needed to offset emissions. Passengers can then add that offset amount via their ticket during the booking process. Finally, MyClimate uses the money to fund projects around the world fighting carbon emissions, deforestation, and support education of environmental protection.

**11. Puerto Rico Set Plans for a Sustainable Future**

In 2017, Hurricane Maria killed over 3,000 people and did $91.6 billion in damage. Rolling with the punches, the people in Puerto Rico are building stronger, more-resistant communities. Eighteen months after the hurricane, the island is now planning to move to [100% renewable energy](https://www.fastcompany.com/90322111/puerto-rico-just-passed-a-bill-to-require-100-renewable-electricity-by-2050). By 2050, with the help of a massive solar grid, Puerto Rico will have turned misfortune into prosperity for all.

**12. The UK Safeguarded Ocean Territory Twice the Size of England**

“The UK is already leading the rest of the world by protecting over 30% of our ocean – but we know there is more to do,” said Environment Secretary [Michael Gove](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/englands-marine-life-protected-with-blue-belt-expansion). Happily, the United Kingdom has designated a massive area of ocean territory as a marine habitat. The legislation protects 41 patches of sea – the largest expansion of the UK’s “Blue Belt” to date. This area is a collective 4,600 square miles of habitat … nearly eight times the size of London.

**13. Renewable Energy Took the Lead**

The report is in: [75 percent](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/renewables-cheaper-than-75-percent-of-u-s-coal-fleet-report-finds) of coal production is more expensive than solar or wind and [a third](https://inhabitat.com/one-third-of-the-worlds-power-now-comes-from-renewable-energy/) of the world’s power comes from renewable sources. By 2025 the picture becomes clear … the entire US coal system will be out-competed on cost by wind and solar. The best part? This accounts for the cost of building new turbines and solar panels.

Mike O’Boyle, co-author is the [report for Energy Innovation](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coal-Cost-Crossover_Energy-Innovation_VCE_FINAL.pdf), expects “there is huge potential for wind and solar to replace coal, while saving people money.” How’s that for a sustainable future?

**14.** **100 Million Trees Spread Their Roots**

Trees provide the very necessities of life. They give clean air, protect our drinking water, and provide shelter for many. Though, they are still threatened each day.

With the brand-new [Time for Trees Campaign](https://timefortrees.org/), hopes are high and goals are big. By 2022 The Arbor Day Foundation aims to plant 100 million trees around the globe and inspire 5 million people to carry the mission forward. The mission? Removing 578,000 tons of chemical pollution from our air. Now that’s a positive change for all! “Together, we can create change … through trees.” (Arbor Day)

**15. United Together to Save the Bees and Butterflies**

It’s estimated one out of every three bites you take each day was made possible by a pollinator, yet they are at a critical point in their survival. 

Launched back in 2015, the National Pollinator Garden Network released their [Million Pollinator Garden Challenge](http://millionpollinatorgardens.org/). In 2019, they not only reached their goal but surpassed it. Over 1 million gardeners and homeowners have joined the fight to save threatened pollinators. Today, as more people join the fight, the registered gardens add up to 5 million acres of enhanced pollinator habitat.

You don’t have to be a beekeeper to save the planet … just plant some flowers!

**16.** **Scuba Divers Break World Record for Underwater Cleanup**

In 2015, 614 divers led by Ahmed Gabr hunted down plastics under the waves of the Red Sea. This year, led by [Project AWARE](http://www.ourpositiveplanet.com/scuba-divers-break-world-record-for-underwater-cleanup/), 633 divers from North and South America gathered at Deerfield Beach Pier. Together, the participants removed over 3,200 pounds of debris from the ocean!

As shown by the divers, if you want to create change, it’s as easy as a dip in the water. But … bring a buddy and some gear too.

**17.** **Plastic Waste Meets its Match With #Trashtag Challenge**

It seems like there is a new viral trend on social media every day, but this is one I can get behind! It’s rare when a hashtag results in a change to the environment, but the [\#Trashtag](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trashtag-challenge-inspires-bored-teens-and-others-clean-the-planet-2019-03-11/) challenge is doing exactly that.

The challenge is simple: go to a place that has become overrun with plastic or trash, clean it, and post your before and after photos. [UCO Gear](https://blog.ucogear.com/trashtag-project-ambassadaor-profile/) came up with the challenge in 2015, but it hadn’t become viral until a Facebook post tagged “tired teens” featured participants cleaning a polluted forest. And as if the impact hasn’t been big enough, the challenge also increased awareness of important issues … like how many recyclables end up in the trash. 

Challenge accepted.

**18.** **Supermarket Praised for Innovative Packaging**

This past year, social media users went bananas for an eco-friendly solution to plastic packaging. In Chiangmai, Thailand, the [Rimping Supermarket](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/03/25/thailand-supermarket-uses-banana-leaves-instead-of-plastic-packaging/#5594dc287102) began wrapping their fruits and vegetables in banana leaves and flexible bamboo. This is a common practice among street vendors in tropical climates, but it has never been seen in an international store!

Fun fact: There have been about 9 billion tons of plastic produced to date. How much of that has been recycled? Only 9%. Imagine the change in the world (especially our oceans) would see if all international supermarkets went “au naturale.”

**19.** **Britain Has First Week Without Coal Since Industrial Revolution**

Do you remember Queen Victoria? No? Me neither. It’s exciting to say that Britain has had its first [coal-free week](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/08/britain-passes-1-week-without-coal-power-for-first-time-since-1882) since she was on the throne! Running the networks in England, Scotland and Wales (ouch that’s big), the last coal generator shut down a 1:24 pm on May 1st. Making history, it came back online seven days later.

This achievement came only two years after Britain’s [first coal-free day](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/britain-set-for-first-coal-free-day-since-the-industrial-revolution) since the Industrial Revolution. How’s that for improvement?

**20.** **U.S. National Parks Had a Huge Win**

During the second week of March, President Trump signed off on the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, [Management and Recreation Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-29/) – containing 100 bills geared to protect the great outdoors! The act will protect wilderness areas in all 50 states, reinstate the federal conservation fund, and protect Yellowstone from mining.

Though there is still much to do to keep America beautiful, this is a step in the right direction. Are you up to plant trees with [The Arbor Day Foundation](https://www.arborday.org/)? Let’s get this nature!

# Key Takeaways

**1.** **A Better Future for All**

\- Why strive to be your best if you only end up helping yourself? When it comes to being our best selves, we know that we need to look to the future. As you create a future of goodness, continue to let the changes others are making inspire your own actions. And when you act, make sure that you act with the world’s interests in mind … literally.

**2.** **Stand for What Matters**

\- As we have learned from Nick Mallos, “plastics are now found everywhere in the world, throughout the entire marine ecosystem…” Although this is a haunting issue, the EU took a stand against plastics banning 10 types of non-reusables. New York banned plastic bags, and plastic waste met its match with the #Trashtag challenge. People all over the world are standing up for what they believe in – for what matters. Today, you can too.

**3.** **Aim for Continuous Growth** 

\- Michael Grove made it clear that “the UK is already leading the rest of the world by protecting over 30% of our ocean…” However, how he finished the sentence was humbling “…but we know there is more to do.” Even though the UK is leading the world, they want to do more, they are aiming for continuous growth. There is something special here that anyone can learn from. Even if you are the very best (at whatever you do), there is always room for improvement. The aim for continuous growth is noble for it not only benefits oneself, but those around them as well.",environment,1563379889,trevormcmahon,4,3,True,2019-07-17 12:11:29

Local-level Rainwater Harvesting Initiatives to Combat Climate Change,"Meera Subramanian, in her recent book  *Elemental India: The Natural World at a Time of Crisis and Opportunity* talks about the case of Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, borewell drilling since the 1960s caused the drying up of underground aquifers. The local population has been contructing, recently, rainwater catchments called *johads.* They have also been planting trees in order to reinvigorate the landscape. The author of the book specifically talks about the Alwar district where Rajendra Singh and his organization called Tarun Bharat Sangh started the movement. Similar initiatives have been carried out across 12 other districts as well. In the village of Bhaonta, since the 1980s, *johads* have been built by people who volunteered to take on elaborate construction projects, and this has had huge benefits. For instance, some of the villages were able to reinstate their water table enough to do farming (which was stopped), and this contributed to economic well-being as well.  Further, many women, who were earlier tasked with travelling large distances to get water, have become free of this difficult task. Such practices based on old knowledge systems, had become lost in the wake of modern planning and developmentalist projects. Reviving them can go a long way in battling climate change at the local level.

NPR: Is Recycling Bad for the Environment?,"“Cities might be picking up your recyclables, but there is a very good chance they aren't being recycled. And that might be a good thing...if you really care about the planet. “

I saw some related articles but I thought that this episode of Planet Money was pretty incredible. In the current recycling economy, the environmental costs of cleaning and repurposing recycled materials, other than metals, outweighs the environmental benefits of recycling them. The answer? Incineration. Of course this is a gross over-simplification of the conversation, but if you’re interested in the environmental economics of recycling, do yourself a favor and give it a listen.

I want to achieve household NZE and home compliance with the Paris Accord.

As a vegan zero waste, I know that there’s so much area of our life to care about that sometime looks endless.   
I aim for a long time to bring all the sustainable responsibility to my professional area: music (Cello &amp; composition)  
Since some years of journey, I banished most of the plastic out of my life but I also find a solution for the plastic that are still around our planet.   
I’m building an electric cello of 12 strings that will be made by recyclable plastic from the ocean, produced and collected from the organization “plasticbank” that collects plastic from the beach of a lot of countries around the world.  
The cello also has 2 solar tapes for generates itself energy for the micro controller. I also use electronics that are certified by Rohs and I’m even using cold carbon ink for the circuits  
If you like music and you would like to promote iniciatives like that, I would be very grateful if you could share the campaign on Kickstarter among colleagues, friends and people involved with sustainability.

How Green Energy and EVs Will Drive Humanity Over a Cliff,"By 2050, there will be at least 2bn cars on the world's roads. If all of those cars were EVs, annual production of neodymium and dysprosium would need to increase by 70% and stay at that level until 2050. On the same basis, annual copper output would need to increase 100%, and cobalt output would need to increase by at least 250% to meet global demand.

The increase in renewable energy infrastructure needed to provide power for EVs would also consume more metals and minerals. Wind turbines require a lot of steel, while solar panel installations consume several scarce minerals, such as high purity silicon, indium, tellurium and gallium. Extracting the minerals themselves is also a power-hungry process, adding to demand.

https://www.petroleum-economist.com/articles/midstream-downstream/power-generation/2019/ev-revolution-could-stall-due-to-mineral-shortages

Demand for copper, for example, could rise by 275 to 350% by 2050, according to academics at Yale University. The World Bank estimated in 2017 that action to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C from pre-industrial levels could mean a seven-fold increase in demand for cobalt and an 11-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2050.

The current EU target is to ramp up production of Electric Vehicles 200 times by 2030. But, here’s the thing – this would lead to an increased demand for production inputs of cobalt, lithium and nickel and copper to build the electrical vehicles. However at 100 times the demand world cobalt resources would be exhausted in 8 months, lithium in 5 years, nickel in 4 months and copper in 5 months.

Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet Inc’s Nest thermostat and Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today.

The Future of Electronics May Depend on Deep Sea Mining for Minerals

https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/deep-sea-mining-metal-resources-advanced-technology-devel/

If, as the IEA predicts, there are 125 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030, it will require roughly 10 million tonnes of copper – a 50% increase over current annual global copper consumption (20 million tonnes).

The additional wind turbines built by 2030 would require roughly two million tonnes of copper – about 10% of the world’s current production.

That’s not even taking into account how much copper would be needed for a quadrupling of solar power, and all the enhancements to the electrical grid and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles that will be required.

Given how much aluminum, metallurgical coal, copper, aluminum, zinc and rare earths are required for each wind turbine and each EV – and how much lithium and cobalt are needed for EV batteries – it begs the question: Will the transition to a low-carbon economy lead to “peak metals” (the point of maximum metal production)?

The targets that governments are setting for themselves for electric vehicle and renewable energy adoption will require a massive increase in mining, and there’s some question as to whether the new mines required can even be built in time to meet the demand according to the timelines being set.

Rare earth metals are used in solar panels and wind turbines—as well as electric cars and consumer electronics. We don't recycle them, and there's not enough to meet growing demand.

A musical concert near an endangered species nest,"  

First of all, sorry for my bad english.

I'm from Italy and I don't know if you can help me.

In 2 days there will be a musical concert (Jova Beach Party) on the beaches of Rimini, a famous italian tourist location. Those beaches are home of an [endangered species](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadrius_alexandrinus) . 

Is there anything I can do about it?

   
 [Source 1](https://www.chiamamicitta.it/spostare-rimandare-jova-beach-party-esposto-ambientalisti-alla-procura-rimini/) [Source 2](https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/cronaca/2019/07/08/esposto-contro-jova-beach-party_wdl2FpZYPtIDTXVczTNqQJ.html) [Source 3](https://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/07/08/news/arriva_il_beach_tour_di_jovanotti_a_rimini_esposto_in_procura_degli_ambientalisti-230689184/)

I translated some info found on local online newspaper:

*After appeals to the two Municipalities ""to common sense and collaboration"" to try to protect the four chicks of fratino, a protected species, present in the area of ​​the event, the associations AsOER, Italia Nostra Rimini, Legambiente and Lipu sent a complaint, among others, to the Public Prosecutor of Rimini and to the Ministry.*

   
 

*The Fratino (Charadrius alexandrinus) - the environmental associations recall - is a small bird that nests on European beaches. In Europe since the beginning of the century there has been a consistent decrease. In Italy it is estimated that the population is less than 700 pairs, in continuous decline. In Emilia-Romagna there are now only 30-40 couples (one tenth of those present in the 1980s). The species lays in April-May directly in small hollows of the sand from 1 to 3 eggs and can, in case of failure, try a second nesting between May and June. The incubation period for the eggs is 24-27 days. The young, after 24/36 hours from birth, follow their parents in search of food; they are able to fly at 28 days of age.*

   
 

*On the coast between Rimini and Riccione there are currently four chicks that, as stated in the statement, will not be able to fly before July 15 and ""there is a high probability that they will be crushed and involuntarily killed"". For this reason, considering that about 40 thousand people will attend the Jova Beach Party, the associations ask that the event be moved to another place or postponed to a date after July 25th.*",environment,1562604171,WorriedDebate,0,5,True,2019-07-08 12:42:51

Arcadia Power - Clean energy for free @ or bellow your current rate. My review.,"Clean energy for cheap

I signed up while I was in school 2 years ago.

Here is what I like

\-Freemium model meaning anyone can sign up for 50% clean energy. I signed up for full 100% energy just 1.5 cents more once I got a full time job. They send you certificate on the invoice every month.

\- Ability to pay with credit card.

\- Easy to use dashboard. They provide cool graphs

\- They pay bill +-3 days when they get a bill from utility company.

\-My rate stayed the same or even cheaper than my regular utility company.

\-Smart rate I like this one since they compare my electric company. If they don't find cheaper rate they keep your existing one. Win-win-win?

\-Considering buying a share of community solar garden.

\-They provide tips on how to save energy

It's completely free for their 50% renewable option and you can get up to 25$ off your first bill if you use my sign-up code:

"Warning To Youth: A video of James Hansen calling Guy McPherson crazy - YT Queued @ 2:23, and why this is important","Environmental collapse is either a rough and tumble slope, or it's straight down.

If you are 15 years old, you barely heard of James Hansen because he's verboten. 

James Hansen told us what to do 10 years ago. We ignored him.

McPherson is from the left, and Hansen is from the right.

Just because you accept collapse, doesn't mean you should make rash life decisions.

If you are a McPhersonite, and believe humans will be extinct in 10 years, then you are going to make big mistakes that will ruin your life and accelerate collapse.

You might be dreaming of living in a van, that will be the worst decision you ever made.

James Hansen and Rachael Carson are my heros. You are at the apex of the history of all life on this planet, and what goes through your mind right now is more important to life on earth than at anytime throughout human history.

Peter Carter put out a video recently saying we do not have 10 years to do something about the climate, we got 1 year.

I’ve heard so much about how rain in the atmosphere helps regulate the earths CO2 levels. What if the air pumped underwater could do the same. A large scale solar powered operation in which compressed air is pushed down near the seafloor, and let out in tiny bubbles, to nurture plankton on it way up. A sort of green house for the sea. My hypothesis is that the bubbles released deep underwater will provided CO2 to microscopic organisms in the ocean that can use the gas to release oxygen.

"Runaway Mass Extinction and Runaway Hothouse Earth Cannot Be Stopped Or Reversed Now, And That's The Good News!","Yesterday's ocean acidification tipping point story was the final nail in the coffin. Our food is killing soil, insects, fish, frogs, birds and anything that comes within miles of it. If a bird eats 3 neonicotinoid seeds, it dies. All male vertebrates are turning into females. Children's bones are getting more fragile every year. All the micro/nano plastics and metals are eating away the blood barrier that protects our brains. 

Governments are worse than ineffectual when it comes to reality. The Extinction Rebellion people want more taxes. The Yellow Vests want less taxes. People hide their conservative natures and vote in right wing nut bars because the left are such sell-outs. You are putting your life at risk, just by wearing a plain red hat.

Fifty million more people are going hungry every year since 2014, a rate that will increase exponentially. If an early frost hits the midwest this year, then the 40% of Americans who can barely pay rent and food will face massive food costs. The food itself is so poisoned, you risk your life eating it.

Even without poisoned food shortages, we're headed for civil war. We live in a police state run by criminals. The FBI and Justice departments are corrupt. None of this is good. 

Even when people consider collapse, they think of it in only the narrowest of terms. Even the Pentagon knows climate change and mass extinction are its biggest threats. You know it's bad when even the Pentagon is worried. Since so many kids read this site, I won't even go into what I think about the Pentagon.

You got McPhersonites saying humans will be extinct in 10 years. You got Michael Mann-onites saying solar panels and EVs will save us. Our kids are so immersed 24/7 in the fantasies of smartphone video displays, they don't even talk to each other in person, instead they talk through toxic social media.

The chasm of political rift is widening and deepening exponentially. Even my wife, god bless her, thinks Antifa are the good guys. This is not the way we're going to bridge this divide to get anything done. The American system of politics has so many checks and balances, that only unanimity can do anything.

This leads us to a winner-take-all mentality, which will divide even Resilience communities. Believe me, that's why the hippies gave up their back-to-the-land dreams back when they were the young progressives.

I feel sorry for you kids. To me, kids are under 30, and tweens are under 40. I'm 61 yo, and can't deal with the anguish of my generations failings. I'm deeply sympathetic to the progressive yearnings of kids, but it's too late, and all I feel is sorrow.

Discussion: Lack of coordination between enviromental groups,"Don't know if this ok to post this here, but I wanted to talk about something.

Ive heard some people talk about ozone layer as a clear example on how the world quickly act on the issue. But this was a simpler issue, just replace the CFCs with something else and that's it. Not to say that was easy to do or didn't cost any money, is that the Climate Crisis is so much more complex.  Fossil fuels are more deeply ingrained in every aspect of our lives that is hard to even imagine solutions.

So, even for people that agree that there is a Climate Change and that we humans are causing it, they still don't act cause they tend to get overwhelmed. This is also caused by misinformations campaigns by our friends on the fossil fuel industry. Whenever I talked to people they say: ""Well, whats about China or the US?"" or ""There is nothing we can do about it"" or ""We shouldn't do anything, corporations do"". It's like a defense mechanism to a problem that is too big.

For people that do what to do something, they don't know what to do. There is a lot of organizations and social movements out there (Greenpeace, WWF, FridaysforFuture, ExtintionRebellion, etc). Even on reddit there is a lot of enviromental subreddits. I feel like every one is trying the best to do their part, but we need a more clear and precise message to deliver to the politicians and to the general public.

Carbon calculators or fuel calculators,"Hi folks, there's an old 'fact' in Ireland that the 'worst' fruit you can eat here is a kiwi. The reason for this is that it releases  4 times its own weight in carbon being shipped from New Zealand to Ireland. Now, I'm not sure if that is true and I don't want to advocate that it is (although it might well be).  What I would like to know is if anyone knows of  a formula or calculation that would allow me to figure such a thing out.  I've managed to find average fuel outputs for diffident sized vessels as well as average fuel usages at different speeds for different ships.  I was wondering if anyone already has these answers (or formulas) available.  I want to be able to calculate how much fuel (and therefore carbon) has been released shipping my items from around the world (per kg or ton).  

I am aware that there are many different methods of shipping (air freight, train, truck, ship and so on). At the moment I am only concerned with ocean freight.  I am quite literally trying to figure out how much fuel (carbon) is used to import fruits and vegetables into Ireland. This solves a practical problem for me that I can expand onto other areas/models of production.

"If the glaciers and polar ice is melting so quickly, why are so many lakes or ocean coast not showing it now?","I am whole heartedly convinced that we are experiences a global warming due to our environmental footprint but let me explain my reason for my question.

So I lived across the street from Lake Michigan my entire life. I spent many a summer exploring the waters along our coast lines and slowly but surely our coast line moved further out.

Hi /r/environment. On June 28, Governor Mike Dunleavy cut the University of Alaska system's budget by $130 million. This is a HUGE blow to the university, and a lot of people could lose their jobs over this.

The Arctic is especially vulnerable to climate change, and University of Alaska and its faculty's research is heavily involved in monitoring the environmental impacts in the region. This cut would cripple the University's ability to support these researchers, at a time where it's crucial we understand how the Arctic is responding to global warming.

The bottom line: **WE NEED YOUR HELP!**

This message is sent by faculty at University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) to their colleagues, but please take the time as a concerned citizen to express your disapproval of this measure:

&gt;The Governor of Alaska decided last week to cut the University of Alaska system state budget by 41% ($135 million). The Alaska legislature can vote to override the Governor's actions but 45/60 legislators need to agree...by July 8th. 

&gt;UAF is calling on collaborators and researchers external to the UA system to chime in and express their concern for these cuts and voice support of overriding the Governor's veto. This is a big ask...but if any of you have the time, it would be very helpful if you could take a minute to email the AK legislature, in your capacity as a polar researcher express support of a veto override. 

&gt;You can use this link to automatically generate an email with addresses for the House or Senate... https://www.uaf.edu/chancellor/initiatives-and-policies/advocacy/akleg.php

Have any of you given thought as to when to pull out of the markets in anticipation of the markets tanking?

The price of capturing a ton of carbon will soon be 100$. Do the carbon math,"For example, if your country averages to 10 tons of CO2 per person, that's a thousand dollars every year per person to actually directly (unlike funding solar energy in africa, which is another beast) offset their carbon emissions for that year.  


That's about 80000$ per person's lifetime, if prices and consumption were to remain the same. It isn't easy to fund, and it certainly isn't impossible.  


Of course we will soon be needing negative emissions, and that's why the emissions per capita is going to have to keep going down, as will the price of carbon capture.

I asked him about the cuts and he told me he had a hard time and I talked to him about it and why it's not good and told him I also do it. the he went away after we talked. I sat down and started thinking after like 4 minutes of thinking I went back to work. He came back and wanted to talked he thanked me for being nice and helping. I talked to him and asked him why he started and what happened he told me he has 2 mothers and that was one of the reasons he got bullied at school. I talked to him and said not to listen to them and that it's cool having 2 moms becouse I have a friend that has 2 moms and they are really nice. He told me he tried to kill himself once and he got put in a mental hospital for children, (I have also been there). I told him when he gets home to talk to his mothers and tell them he wants help, becouse he really wants it. I also told him that if he doesn't have anyone to talk to he can always come to my work when I'm working.

The IPCC will make you think we have until 2060 to drop emissions 100%. This is not true because they only include emissions in that scenario backdated to the 1880s.

Trees Will Not Save Us
---

The Global Carbon Project's Executive Director explains the flaws in the study's conclusion. Very short, very crisp.

https://threader.app/thread/1147066574299377664

For some weird reason, even Mother Jones may have gotten this one right.

https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/07/trees-will-not-save-us-from-climate-change/

We emit about 100 gigatons of carbon per decade, which results in a rise in carbon of about 10 ppm / decade. This overly simplified rule of thumb is useful for imagining what the future holds. The only certainty is that the rate of change changes, or in other words, things will get 'worse than expected'. But you already knew that.

The reason that methane started rising again in 2009 is because of fracking and Arctic wetlands. 

Fracking expert Dr. Anthony Ingraffea says we hit 2° C by 2030. While he may not be right about this, neither is he wrong. The Arctic Tundra is turning into mud, and Natalie Shakova has renewed her warning. Natalie doesn't sit in front of a computer all day hyping books.

This post began with a link saying we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid 3° C. But 2° C is the runaway ignition point to 2 processes, mass extinction and hothouse earth. Here is some simple arithmetic to use as a memory aide.

2° C = runaway mass extinction + runaway hothouse earth

**Reminders**

Claire Fyson said emissions must go down 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 1.5° C. That was one year ago.

Stefan Rahmstorf said emissions must go down 100% in 20 yrs to avoid 2.0C. That was three years ago.

Hans Schellnhuber said 5 major hothouse tipping points start below 2° C and will ignite 8 more major tipping points. This is one of the most important studies, ever. It was ignored.

My experiences,"So I had the chance to live i three countries which are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. I would like to observe the changes I have observed: 

Saudi Arabia: I grew up here so I have the best insight about this country. I remember when I was younger we had real winters. It never got below 0 but close to it and never above 20 degrees. We never had to turn on the acs during winter. In fact, it was so cold that all of us (my family) would sleep in one room under big blankets and it would be a really enjoyable time of the year. Fast forward to last year, and it just felt like a cooler summer. It felt like there was no winter at all except really early in the morning, but other times i could do fine without a jacket. It wasnt just me, we all noticed how different it is from before. We even got lesser rain than we used to. My father told me that when he first moved here it used to get cold enough that a person died one time because of it (might have been an old bedouin). 

Russia (Siberia specifically): I moved to Russia to learn Russian and do undergrad. Winter came early and stayed for a long time to the point I felt that all my life has passed in winter. It was common for the weather to fall below -20 degrees celsius, and some rare moments it would even get as cold as -44 especially around February. However, every person I talked to would say that -40 was much more frequent before and the winters lasted even longer than it already does. 

Pakistan: Now I haven’t lived so much here. I never spent winter here, tho my family originates from here. However I can speak on insight that its gotten warmer here too. We come from Northern Pakistan so it would be cooler up there than Saudi Arabia. I was told that when my parents were younger there would be more hail storms and even snow on rare occasions.

We need to stand," Now I may be a teenager using reddit but I wanted to start off somewhere trying to make a change. I feel like we need to stand and change our Earth.

There are so many things I belive even as a teen we can change such as recycling more, conserving energy, maybe living life and helping our environment.

"The best way to make America's transportation system more green is more public transportation. More rail. But getting that investment from the tax payers is unlikely. Americans are too used to their cars and road system, electric cars and clean power is the most realistic option.","I'm a Civil Engineering student who's studied transportation, traffic, and city planning to a decent extent. It is better to have more dense cities with lots of options to walk, bike, or use rail.  

Unfortunately many American cities grew after the personal car became popularized. This caused cities to sprawl. The damage has been done. We can make efforts to reverse it. Kansas City and other municipalities have reintroduced street cars, which is phenomenal and these efforts should continue to be pushed. But the most realistic option is to switch to electric cars and clean energy. America's road network isn't going away, there's too much rural land and suburbs which rely heavily on the automobile. 

Not only is public transportation greener, it's also much safer. I work at a state DOT. The department always preaches that the number one goal is to have zero roadway deaths annually. There was a good downward trend as seatbelts became accepted and safety standards increase. However as smartphones gained popularity the deaths began rising again.  

So a push for public transportation needs to be made, but the nations transport will not switch away from cars in the next few decades. But it's possible to get the vast majority of cars to run on electric in the next 20 years. It's possible for us to completely cut reliance on coal in 20 years. It needs to be done.

Direct action.,"Dear all:

Most of us on this sub care about the environment except for a few brigadiers etc. 

A lot of us are vegetarian, a lot of us are vegan, a lot of us avoid palm oil, a lot of us save water, a lot of us do a lot. It is incredibly admirable and the right thing to do no question. 

How much of an impact this really has on the environment is minimal. If you live in a house (god forbid you have money) or rent an apartment, you’re “choosing” (consumer choices) to pay for something that has caused huge local and global damage. The cement, the glass, the electricity etc, are all things that go into the creation of a modern (western? Jk what a terrible word) home, that have high emissions.

Should you live on the street and not cause any damage? Yes. Is that feasible/ is anyone going to do it? No is the answer about 99.9% of the time. The less you have, the harder this is to be homeless. So what are we to do and who is at fault/causing our planet to die? 

Obviously you’re already aware but it’s the corporations and government. They hold the power to stop what they are doing. The only thing that prevents them from doing anything is their own greed. 

So what’s the solution to this? Direct action. There are forms like signing up CEO’s to hundreds of news letters or calling them over and over. All this will do is cause them to make a new email address and change their number. 

More has to be done, it is time to act. What is it that I’m suggesting? 

I can’t say. It’s against the reddit rules. Even what I said just above is theoretically against the rules (witch hunt type of stuff ya’kno, luckily I didn’t name names). 

What I can tell you/ suggest you my dear reader to do, is to learn more and read more about direct action. 

That’s my 2 cents, I’m sure you already know, but repetition is key. Help fight for the planet; protect her from greed by any means necessary.

Have a nice day!

Interview with co-founder of Extinction Rebellion - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgsF78U0G9M,"This is a long one hour interview I conducted with Roger Hallam last week and posted on friday on YouTube

The post was originally made in philosophy and was upvoted but moderator then closed it - so I hope its OK to repost here -  it is about the philosophy behind Extinction Rebellion and also their announcement due shortly of a massive global uprising aimed at sweeping away the politcal elites that have failed to do anything about the eenvironment for 30 years whle paying it lip service

 Roger is mainly focused on political philosophy - the theory of how dissent is best voiced in a democracy once democratic means have failed. His answer, as we all know, is civil disobedience. He is well on the way to hundreds of thousands of supporters turning out for the next big action, in October.

Hallam has studied successful rebellions from the American Revolution onwards, and learned the lessons. Now he is applying them to the climate battle. He has politicians begging him to work with them, but he is steadfastly “refusing to be co-opted.”

Aim is to have Citizens Assemblie take over from politicians who are discredited because they have failed to act for 30 years.

Green New Deal dismissed as window dressing.

Extinction Rebellion (XR) ran a protest in New York City last week when 70 people were arrested outside the NY Times.

It is planning more strikes over the next few weeks and months, demanding radical action on climate change. Whole cities will be brought to a halt until governments listen and negotiate

Hallam says groups are springing up all over America, the UK and the rest of the world. “The political class are going to do everything apart from anything,” he said. “There's going to be a rebellion in America against the government this autumn.” Plans will be announced next week for a global month of action

Do people place a distorted value to the impact of recycling on the environment v the impacts of other areas of energy consumption that could be addressed by the individual?,"The angle I'm coming from is more physics based, energy consumption, energy conservation, energy efficiency, carbon omissions, atmospheric constituents. There are cross overs with earth science I suppose, but also psychology as the human tendancy to miscalculate and bias.

I'm looking to understand with evidence and peer review papers the recycling of domestic packaging and it's effectiveness on the environment. This I'm looking to compare with our other impacts on environment, and how it compares with any gains from changes in behaviours, and which would be more impactful.

I'm not looking at the side benefits of recycling, example being getting the subject into conversation to move people toward awareness, the types of things I'm looking for example at finding data and quantified research that looks at whether recycling is effective, it's hidden cost, the positives and negatives, comparisons to other consumption (eg cars, meat, flying, agriculture), and so determine the skew of importance that people place on recycling plastics v their perceptions of impact.

My question that I'm building upon, it's that do people place a distorted value to the impact of recycling when more gain can be made with a move of focus on other areas of energy consumption.

From a personal experience, witnessing individuals having emotional strong opinions on recycling, to the point of critisms of others behaviour, but whilst they continue eating large quantities of meat, driving a car, and traveling multiple flights, is hypocritical or at least misguided. I want to know if my intuition is flawed. Perhaps it's both, and that people tend to do what they are comfortable in doing, something is better than nothing, albeit from a non informed position.

I'm looking to challenge my own thinking here.

In secondary knowledge gain, I'm looking for studies that highlight where real gains for changing behaviours and government polices would be had for improved impact to environmental health, example being research and development of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation, investments in infrastructure for electric cars and improved battery manufacturing and disposal.

I've access to academic libraries, and I've carried out some initial simple searches. It seems have to do some refining and cross referencing to find what I'm looking for, so I'm reaching out incase anyone here can point me to some studies that might save me some time or if there are areas in this subject I should consider and broaden my approach.

From small ideas to global ideas like high protein, easy\* to produce mushrooms to feed populations who need (Vegan) fast, healthy food with minimal resources. More sustainable alternatives.

Anyhoo, one of the most practical easy ones to use, especially from my point of view living in a somewhat rural area in PNW where mushrooms would happily grow, is growing mycelial mats on areas next to highways, old logging roads, lakesides &amp; where preventative erosion control is needed.

Oyster mushrooms, native to temperate forests of PNW (Pacific Northwest), are known as the bee's knees of easy growing shrooms. Regular woodchips, bought at building supplies stores amongst many places available, can be mixed -inoculated- with oyster spores and will germinate with enough water. The hope is that spores can germinate before, in a commercial lab setting before being introduced to the substrate.

Once spores germinate, they weave together and grow, while converting the woodchips into healthy soil. This network of fibers encourages plant growth and health.

- “Every generation has this type of seemingly- insurmountable global crisis to overcome like the Cold War or WW2 for example. People thought the world was going to end in these situations - whether a nuclear bomb, a dictator, a depression, etc. - and then it didn’t.”

- “If true, this wouldn’t really affect us. Maybe our children and grandchildren. Don’t worry so much.”

- “Who are all of these scientists and how can they be sure? Don’t always believe what you read” ... fake news blah blah blah

As the climate crises deepens, I'm finding myself more and more uncomfortable with how ignorant I am of the details surrounding it. I'm by no means a sceptic, but I'd definitely like to educate myself more, as I'm definitely naive to a lot of what is going on and being talked about.

A letter to my parents,"  

A letter to my parents (and many other parents of millennial children)

Throughout the world, the alarm bells that have been ringing for well over a decade now are finally starting to be heard. Freak weather events, record breaking heatwaves and highest temperatures year after year, distinct absences of frosty mornings in the winter, periods of drought and then weeks of heavy rain. Angry young people are telling politicians to sit down, shut up and listen, taking to the street with placards essentially begging for a shot at their future, before its robbed from us and generations to come. 

I don’t know how to persuade the complacent older generation who convivially laugh about how they’ll be dead before it’s a real problem for them - but Mum, Dad, I won’t be. I will be very much alive and so will (god willing) your grandchildren. You raised me to be successful, the scientist that I am. I have had the benefit of higher education that you have not so perhaps I have had the (mis)fortune of having these issues thrust in my face to analyse, to critique, to evidence and find solutions for. I can assure you now that you will not be dead before it’s an issue, because it’s an issue now. At the predicted pinnacle of all this climate chaos, in 2100, your grandchildren will be alive and fighting to stay cool, fighting for clean drinking water and adequate food, fighting for space and resources with millions of climate refugees who will be leaving equatorial areas in the next few decades. I do not want to hear that it is not your problem any more, because I am your daughter and it is my problem, and therefore yours.

Do you know that I am considering not having children at all? Since my late teens I dreamed of having a family, having children and raising them to be good and kind. But raising my children right may be the least of my concerns if I must arm them with the skills and wherewithal to cope with a planet that is slowly dying. You can have them during school holidays and feed them ice cream and take them to nice places, but when you hand them back to me, I must ensure that their future is secure for them seeing as ‘you’ll be dead’, so who cares. I must ensure that when I die, they are savvy enough to cope, they are tenacious enough to fight for resources. What if I must raise my children to live selfishly to ensure their survival? What if I everything I endeavour to preach, to be kind, to be generous, I have to double back on and preach instead to be cut-throat and vicious? I am not sure I can truly justify bringing new lives into this planet to condemn them to a life of suffering and fighting.

You may think me over dramatic but remember how proud you were when I graduated with my first degree and then my Masters. I have armed myself with analytical skills, I have privileged access to reams of scientific evidence that supports that modern climate change is perpetuated by human activity. Despite there being accessible evidence for the general public freely available, I know you won’t look for it or read it or take it seriously. But believe *me*. Trust *me*. Trust that I am not making this up, I am not being over-dramatic. Believe that I am scared and that you should be too. For my sake and the sake of your grandchildren. 

I would imagine from my (fortunately) limited understanding that coming to realise what trouble the planet is really in is like being diagnosed with cancer. Sat across from a professional who knows better than you, who is trained in these things and highly qualified, telling you that, potentially, you’re absolutely fucked. But. If you start treatment and you start it NOW, there is a chance that you can kick its ass after a bit of time, though you won’t be the same after. Your family won’t be the same. You will go forward in life from now on carefully considering your diet, your level of activity, the products you put on your body and clean your home with. I can imagine that it’s a shock to the system, to look at your life and realise the magnitude of change you must undertake. Knowing that it isn’t just down to you, it’s down to everyone. Your colleagues, your neighbours, your family, your friends, the server who brought you your food, the men who collect your rubbish, the newsreaders on the TV, that comedian you laugh at. What are they doing? What’s the point if they’re not doing a thing either? They’re ignoring this cancer - surely it’ll go away if we just change to energy-saving light bulbs and make sure the tap isn’t running while we brush our teeth... 

I guarantee you if you start making a change tomorrow, someone will see that and think – shit. If you’re doing something, maybe I should too. Maybe this is serious. After all, your daughter is a scientist, she’d know. And Mum, Dad, you should know. This isn’t a secret. This isn’t new. This is real. You might both be sun worshippers and be enjoying this ‘global warming lark’, but it isn’t to be laughed at. It is time to sit down, shut up and listen.",environment,1562064428,concerned_overlywarm,6,14,True,2019-07-02 06:47:08

The circular economy is a production and consumption model that aims to minimize waste while maximizing resources. It has become increasingly popular as corporations strive to become more sustainable and reduce waste, in line with emerging consumer preferences. Circularity also provides avenues for  innovation and creative business models, production, and supply chains.

Solar panels,"Hi. Not sure if i should be posting here or a tech page, but im looking for info on solar panels. There is a ton of them out there that say they charge cell phones and other devices, some battery packs even have solar panels on them, but some of those battery packs for example clearly state that itll take a long time to properly charge by solar and indirectly say to just charge from your plug in and not bother with the panel. 

Id like to get a solar panel to leave in my car while im at work, and charge my phone on the way home. I have found some battery packs that have 5 solar panels to them, or a long panel that i can get the battery pack seperately. Would any of these actually do what i am looking for, or are the small solar panels still a gimick and not to bother unless im installing multiple ones on an rv?

3. Every drop in the ocean counts—you may even influence others.

Weed users who are also environmental enthusiasts - Why?,"I want to preface by saying this is a serious question and I mean it with respect and not to “stir a pot” if you will. 

My question is why do many (and I mean a majority) of individuals who refer to themselves as environmental enthusiasts, conservationists, or who are constantly informing others on how to improve the health of the environment also happen to smoke weed yet not see the hypocrisy with it? 

I’m aware that there are tons of ways that someone hurts the environment everyday including eating meat, driving cars, using electricity, not recycling, etc., but many of these things are almost essential to everyday life. Eating meat is a whole different topic but to many meat can be the only affordable or opportunity they have. When it comes to weed (recreational), weed serves no essential role in a life yet it is pretty bad for the environment. 
- 1lb of weed produced is similar to ~ 2 metric tons of Co2 output 
- increases the use of fertilizers and pesticides in urban developments 
- uses an enormous amount of electricity
- ~ 1% of the US power emissions 
- and more 

This isn’t a Legal vs illegal argument, because making it legal is probably better for the environment anyways. But the main focus of my question is why do so many people, especially young people (50% of 18-25 year olds tend to use weed), argue to be environmentally conscious (where young people are more progressive than old) yet smoke weed every single day?

The Arctic,"  

“The Arctic is our home and we have to take care of it!”

The Arctic is a huge part of our planet with an area of ​​over 21 million square kilometers, which includes the edges of the continents of Eurasia and North America, almost the entire Arctic Ocean with islands, as well as the adjacent parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In its depths, according to experts, a whole treasury of various natural resources is hidden. However, the active development of oil and gas fields in this region inevitably entails environmental problems, in particular, pollution of the Arctic waters, declining animal populations, climate change, etc. In addition, according to statistics provided by the environmental organization called Bellona, ​​during the development of The Arctic has accumulated more than 250 thousand barrels of oil, as well as about a million tons of scrap metal.

Today, a new stage in the development of the Russian Arctic is inextricably linked with one of the top priorities of modern Russia - cleaning the Arctic region from debris. Today this task is better done by the military, who are returning to the Arctic region and clearing the rubble of tons of scrap metal. So, for example, in 2018, the military personnel of the environmental unit of the Eastern Military District, using the new PP-250 baling presses, pressed more than 165 tons of empty metal barrels, and also collected and prepared about 630 tons of garbage for disposal.

How to save India from water crisis in the most doable way,"The best way to save yourself from the water crisis is reduce the usage of water.

There are two types of used water
1: GREY WATER - The water which ain't contain your faeces, urine etc. In short the water which is not used in the flush of your toilet. But it can't be used for drinking.

2: BLACK WATER - Type of used water contaminated with your faeces and urine. In short the water used in the flush of your toilet

You can reuse only the grey water, not the black water. 
1: You can use the water filtered from your ac. This is the water which is absorbed by the ac to cool your room, the ac absorbs moisture from your room and filter it out in the process. It is one of the purest type of grey water. It is cool so in the summer it is a good option to bath with, you can also use it to water your plants, in washing machines or to wash your vehicles.

Is there a website where people can participate in thinking about the solutions to the ecological crisis?,"Hello,

Sorry if I made grammar mistake or if I am not clear, English is not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if there is a website where everyone can participate in listing the problems related to the current ecological crisis and the solutions we have/can develop. I have bachelor in earth sciences so obviously I feel concerned about climate change and the mass extinction currently happening, but I am not a engineer nor a biologist or an ecologist.

By working together and listing the problem and what we can do about it, if we are enough to do it, we can influence the politics. What would be also great is to find solutions everyone can do ""alone"" (example : find a way to grow some food indoor --&gt; reduce the food you buy that come from intensive farming).

&amp;#x200B;

This is currently some of the main points I have in mind (I did not write everything):

1. detailed list of problems (ex : **melting permafrost** (this is the example I use here to clarify my point))
2. direct consequences (albedo is decreasing)
3. indirect consequences (worsen climate warming, sea level rise, reduction of emerged surface, population migration)
4. solutions to the problem (reduce greenhouse gas emission, compensate decrease of albedo)
5. ways to apply these solutions
   1. **reduce greenhouse gas emission**: 
      1. plant trees, 
      2. factories that stock CO2 (not effective), 
      3. regrow seagrass, seaweed and corals, 
      4. use bikes with a system that stock CO2 when you pedal, 
      5. put bryophyte and lichen on facade of buildings,
      6. ""grow"" stromatolites,
   2. **increase earth albedo**:
      1. use garbage that has a high albedo and place them in regions with long hours of sunshine like desert,
      2. send garbage with low albedo in orbit around earth so they absorb some of the indicent rays,
      3. etc.
6. direct advantage and other use possible
   1. **greenhouse gas emission part** (we will focus on this problem only and not on albedo for the examples below)
      1. trees: wood is extremely useful
      2. factories: ??
      3. seagrass: protect wildlife and flora, seabed fixing, reduce pathogens, can be use to make furniture; seaweed: can be used as food and fertilizer
      4. bike: bikes are everywhere and cheap to buy
      5. etc.
   2. increase earth albedo (not detailed)
7. impact/efficiency
   1. trees: huge
   2. factories: limited (less efficient than tress)
   3. seaweed, seagrass and corals: huge
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
8. difficulties encountered
   1. trees: deforestation, reduce of usable surfaces
   2. factories: high climate impact when construction of factories, materials are not recyclable
   3. seaweed, seagrass and corals: reduce of territory by invasive algae, photic zone is perturbed, corals are very fragile, sensitive to pH and water level
   4. bike: need to find recyclable materials
   5. etc.
9. solutions to the difficulties
   1. trees: stop deforestation, transform livestock area into forest
   2. factories: technology, need to find recyclable materials
   3. seaweed, seagrass: transplantation, habitat protection, corals: help corals to adapt in laboratory?
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
10. complexity:
   1. trees: extremely simple
   2. factories: very complex
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: very complex??
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
11. time to set this up
   1. trees: long
   2. factories: very long
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: very long??
   4. bikes: ??
   5. etc
12. Urgency
   1. trees: extremely urgent
   2. factories: not urgent
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: extremely urgent
   4. bikes: not urgent
   5. etc
13. financial cost + qualification of the workforce
   1. trees: cost: very low; do not need qualification
   2. factories: cost; very high? need qualification
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: cost ?? need high qualification
   4. bikes: cost: ?? qualification: ??
   5. etc
14. cost in energy
   1. trees: very low
   2. factories: very high
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: ?
   4. bikes: ?
   5. etc
15. achievable by a private company ?
   1. trees: yes (sell wood)
   2. factories: ??
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: yes for seagrass (make furnitures) and seaweed (make food and fertilizer) 
   4. bikes: yes
   5. etc

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, to make the most exhaustive list possible, we need as many people as possible, because for example, I don't know what can be the impact of creating bikes that stock CO2. 

My idea is to first make a list where we can find as many idea as possible solutions companies can use, and we propose the other solutions to politicians.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of the list is also to make diagrams to help decision making:

* urgency (point 12) vs complexity (point 10)
* efficiency (point 7) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)
* energy cost (point 14) vs efficiency (point 7)
* urgency (point 12) vs complexity (point 10) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)
* efficiency (point 7) vs complexity (point 10) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)

Chronic consumption of refined carbohydrates has been linked to relative neurocognitive deficits across the lifespan. Hippocampal function is especially impacted, but prefrontal and mesolimbic reward pathways may also be altered. Early life exposure to refined carbohydrates, (i.e., prenatal, juvenile, and adolescence periods) may be particularly toxic to cognitive functioning.

Deliberate ketazine spill. ~1000 tons. How dangerous is this?,"During April and May approximately 500 to 1000 metric tons of chemical waste was spilled in 20 places, mostly onto rural dirt roads, on the side of wheat fields or in a ditch next to dirt roads. 
This fact was made public at the end of May, the delay was so that the police could catch the truck driver. They did, he's under arrest. The preliminary analysis of the VVD (Our EPA) stated that the pollutant is possibly ketazine a byproduct of POROFOR (AZODICARBONAMIDE) manufacturing.

Here are some videos of the spill:
The videos contain the info I have laid out here.
https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTavarsEdgars%2Fvideos%2F2215514648544196%2F

Map of the spills:
http://www.vvd.gov.lv/public/fs/CKFinderJava/images/bilde%20Evita%20gatava.png

The pollutant is brownish and when evaporates makes brownish crystals. During these past two months it has evaporated or seeped into the ground leaving scorched dead plants and small animals. The VVD say that this stuff is a localized pollution that does not affect the groundwater or anything else and most of it must have ""harmlessly evaporated"". No cleanup has been made and there was only a plea from the gov. VVD to the alleged polluting factory to clean it up. At first they had no comment then they started to deny everything. Considering that they are the ONLY factory with ketazine as byproduct in this country and possibly the neighboring too, it may be pretty obvious who's the guilty one. 
These are the ""alleged"" polluters and their production portfolio. 
http://www.biolar.lv/en/products.html

Our VVD ir understaffed and underpaid (what a shocker) and possibly corrupt. Tomorrow is the press conference fortunately with lab results determining exactly which chemical it is and I'm planing on attending it and asking some tough questions, with your help of course.
So if you could chime in with your expertise on some of the official version.

1) Is ketazine really a waste product and not something that has value or application?

2) Is ketazine a byproduct of POROFOR (AZODICARBONAMIDE) manufacturing?

3) How cancerous/dangerous is it?

4) What cleanup should have been made?

5) What measurements and controls should be done to check soil, groundwater.

6) This is in EU, which agency has cleanup guidelines or to whom can we complain.

7) How to get the polluter by the balls.

8) Any other subreddit/forum that may help. This subreddit seemed very active so I posted here.

TL;DR;
Deliberate ketazine spill. How dangerous is this? Cleanup guidelines.

It would mean a lot if You could answer any of these questions or point to the right direction. Thanks.",environment,1560883990,DebianJunkie,7,9,True,2019-06-18 14:53:10

Hey all, I'm a UX designer doing a project on a wildlife conservation app. The idea is that it gives normal folks real time access to help out organizations who post with needs in their area. It has a live feed, similar to Instagram, showing the needs (physical assistance, monetary funding, or your skills) near you. If you donate money to a specific event/campaign, when your money is used, you are sent back photo or video evidence of exactly how it was put to work. You can also choose to donate your skills like web dev or graphic design; or just helping physically by being an extra pair of hands. If you are an organization of any kind who would consider using this, or you are an interested individual, please comment with a way to get in touch. I just have a few questions.

I was the tallest kid in primary school, and I was bullied by the boys. I was a twig, but they called me ‘bushpig’, and according to the principal, it was because the boys liked me. They tormented me, and I was so much taller and ‘bigger boned’ than all the other girls, I felt like a behemoth. Kids can be such little twats, but it stuck with me through high school. I went to an all-girls private school so comparison was rife too.

Stop Scaring Us. Teach Us.,"I've spent a lot of my time as a 20 something-year-old terrified of my future, like most people my age. Every day we go onto the internet and see another article about Donald Trump creating some mess that could cause nuclear war or worsening climate change. We see corporations and other countries hiding their effects on the environment and continuing their same practices of destroying the planet. Like many other people my age, we have started to plan not to have kids, because we figure we may all die within the next hundred years. Even worse is the way media portrays our future to us as only death and destruction. We are terrified to get up in the morning because we think what the point is? What's the point of going to school, having jobs, starting families if we will all be gone soon? I have seen some many 20-year-olds panic and become depressed because they feel too helpless. All we are taught by the people we interact, and the media is that it is helpless. 

I am done being afraid. Stop telling us that we are destined to die. Stop telling us that voting won't matter. Stop telling us that planting more trees or recycling more won't do anything. Stop. Seriously. Start telling us how to live and how we can help. Show us articles of positive change. Show us a positive progression. Show us what we can do to help. Most of us don't deny climate change, we just need to know how we can improve and that there is hope. If you keep telling us there is no hope and nothing can be done, we will panic and do nothing. Once the teenagers and 20-year-olds begin to believe they can do nothing, that's when we are really in trouble.

Why don't stores and marketplaces follow the Oberweis Milk Method when it comes to meat?,"Tried posting this in ELI5 and it got taken down. Trying again here.

Never used a plastic milk jug during that service.

I have seen stores like Trader Joes and Marianos that have seeds/seasoning/nut dispensers where you bring in your empty glass container, fill it, and pay. No plastic.

So why don't we do that with meat? Is it because glass can shatter if stored in a deep freezer, or will crack if taken from freezer to fridge due to uneven heating? Sanitation?

Casual watcher of political debate the other night as UK politics once again proves we're really not much better than trump.

An activist was asking politicians if they could cut the target to 2025. No surprises that they all gesticulated about the current target but noone said they'd try the better it.

My question is- would that even be possible? Without damaging infrastructure and halting production etc. It struck me as odd and a pipe dream.

Ideas for an app to help eco friendly decisions,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leading a team of students attempting to build a free and open source app (and potentially other software products) that can help consumers not only make more eco friendly decisions, but also help them hold companies responsible for the impact they have on the environment, as a lot of emissions are produced on the manufacturing and industrial side of things, rather than things that consumers have a direct effect on. We are currently planning to use ESG (environmental, social, governance) scores to rank companies within product categories, but ESG data has several limitations, such as being voluntarily report by companies and internally monitored. So we'd love to hear more ideas about what information could either help people make better decisions, or help them hold companies responsible. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you'd like to volunteer to help on the project, send me a message. Look forward to hearing from you!

The Withering Bones of Humanity,"Our bones are withering away at a very, very fast pace. Children’s skeletons are becoming more and more fragile EVERY year. On a decadal scale. This is frightening. Bones are synonymous with infrastructure because we would literally collapse without them.

Our jaws are becoming so tiny that crooked teeth are a feature, not an aberration. Some believe our tiny mandibles changed our language, and allowed a 3-fold increase in the use of ""F"" and ""V"" sounds over time. This is why we can now easily say ""Fuck Vox!"".

Our smartphones are already changing the shape of our skulls and causing a spikey protuberance in the back near our necks. This is due to something called, ""text neck"". Our new slouching postures are straining the muscles attached to the base of our skulls – and the body responds by laying down fresh layers of bone. This use to be rare – not any more.

When we compare the height of a person to the width of a single elbow, we can see that human elbows are getting thinner. They are literally withering away.

Children do not play outside anymore – they play video games and stare at toxic photon devices. These devices are damaging the brain's visual cortex and causing endemic myopia. They also cause physical and mental illness.

The chemicals, plastics and metals that make our devices contribute to the biological emasculation, feminization and sterilization of all male vertebrates. While I think our acceptance of biological sexual deviance is ultimately good, it does not bode well for the terrible future we face because we are mentally, physically and sexually weaker.

You will never be able to live without it. It protects you in hospital, allows energy and water to enter your homes (remember lead water pipes?) there are numerous good ways that it benefits mankind.

The problem should not be the banning of plastic, but to educate people to embrace and use it correctly, to dispose of it correctly, and for science to find ways to dispose of it properly that encourages governments and people to follow proper rules.

Just think, if you banned plastic, say for wrapping, then perhaps paper would be used and cause even more destruction of forests.

I've had an idea from a boring meeting today,"today while sitting in a meeting we were given some permanent markers. As I was bored I started drawing with it (even though i suck at it), and at some point i had an idea and drew a whale on my t-shirt. Then I felt sad about whales and wrote RIP under it. And it got me thinking.. I already have some ideas to draw on my shirts, like a bee with text ""you need me"" or something, another is a crossed out AC with ""id rather sweat than starve"", etc.

Buying new clothes for this is not an option, since usually I don't buy clothing (some pants when the current ones become unwearable), and try to minimize unnecessary consumption.

The point is I want to draw pro-environment propaganda on my cloths but I suck at drawing, so I thought asking if anybody knows some such existing pictures. Also, what do you think? If the media doesn't give the necessary coverage... It being hand-drawn might make it a good conversation starter as well.",environment,1560519072,KorallNOTAFISH,4,5,True,2019-06-14 09:31:12

Bribe me to help you save endangered sea turtles.,"Hi everyone 😁 I've been working in the commercial fishing industry for 15 years the  work is seasonal and in the off seasons I build ""Turtle excluding devices"" (T.E.D'S)  I work all over Australia and even shrimped in Florida for a bit.

A very brief history,in the old days nobody cared about the non target species we caught and discarded.

American government wants to save manatees invents TED's 

TED's exclude big creatures but also lots of shrimp

American fisherman get shitty they can't meet domestic demands and imports from the land down under increase

American government tells Aussies ""oi get fucked cunt if you wanna sell your prawns here you need to use TED's 

Aussie dollar was hovering around half a USD at the time and fisherman would kick a baby in the face if the US told them to

Aussies reply ""yeah mate no worries send us blueprints we'll put em in tomorrow""

MURICAAAAAAA!!!! FUCK YEAH!!!! says ""get fucked cunt nobody makes shit as good as us we will send you ones we made by scientists and shit""

Aussies get the Ted's realise how fucked they are catches reduced by 80% 

Random Aussies work day and night making small adjustments to try to make a living

Impossible

2 Aussies redesigns the TED's 1 fisherman and 1 netmaker 

Aussies tell the US ""hey we made these better they barely affect the target species and exclude all larger sea life here's an underwater video me made showing it in action can we use these instead""

Embarrassed USA scientists reply ""hey you recorded video underwater?...wish I thought of that we wind these Ted's acceptable please send blueprints""

Dumb cunts send blueprints and miss a golden opportunity to make MURICAAAAAAA buy them from the land down under

Ok now that you know the history here's where I come in I've worked directly for both of the men who redesigned the TED's I saw the netmaker every single day and worked side by side with him for 3 months a year and I lived and worked with the fisherman 24/7 for 4 months straight

TED' s work in a way but in some ways they don't either by poor installation or deliberate tampering by fisherman and also there is a government legislation loophole that is exploited by every single operator

I can't blow the whistle myself because hellooooo unemployment/it's easy to murder someone at sea and feed the Sharks so pay me using PayPal and I'll spill the beans and provide a specific example of  Raptis the largest Aussie prawn trawler company knowingly gaming the system and give you contact details of 2 witnesses who will gladly testify against the general managers own brother.

Price 
$70 gets you an explanation of the loophole and I will tell you few Common ways skippers alter the devices and don't get caught and how the people who inspect the equipment don't know what they are doing
$250 gets you the example and the contact details of the witnesses and I'll source as many pics of people doing the wrong thing as possible **killing protected species for trophies n shit**

The $70 option if fulfilled will be posted here for all to see the $250 would be by DM email or phone call there's a lot of info and I assume you will have a lot of questions

Ideas for an app to help eco friendly decisions,"Hi,

I'm leading a team of students attempting to build a free and open source app (and potentially other software products) that can help consumers not only make more eco friendly decisions, but also help them hold companies responsible for the impact they have on the environment, as a lot of emissions are produced on the manufacturing and industrial side of things, rather than things that consumers have a direct effect on. We are currently planning to use ESG (environmental, social, governance) scores to rank companies within product categories, but ESG data has several limitations, such as being voluntarily report by companies and internally monitored. So we'd love to hear more ideas about what information could either help people make better decisions, or help them hold companies responsible.

And if you'd like to volunteer to help on the project (we are especially looking for an architect), send me a message. Look forward to hearing from you!

The 2020 Election and it's Relation to Climate Change,"   


Climate Change is easily the greatest existential threat to civilization today. If you are not aware of its potential effects, a[ recent report by the Breakthrough Centre For Climate Restoration](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf) says that Civilization could end by 2050 if Climate Change continues at the rate we see today.

Arguments can be made for Nuclear War, Mass Migration, and other issues being the greatest threat to humanity.

But steps have been taken to address those threats- especially in the United States.

Unfortunately, Climate Change has hardly been addressed in the United States in the way it needs to be. The fact that[ 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) believe climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities- and that we have[ a President who outright denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940)\- proves that point.

What can we do? Let’s start out with the basics. 

The United States is a world leader, no matter your view on the current government administration. [As the 12th richest country in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/richest-countries-in-the-world), the United States has the power to help create the needed change to prevent absolutely catastrophic global warming- but we will need a complete shift away from the current political, social, and economic structure we see in the United States (and the world) today. The solutions to Climate Change are already ready to be deployed. As young activist Greta Thunberg said, “People tell me I should study to become a climate scientist so I can solve the climate crisis. But the Climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.” Greta is right. Studies have been done to show that [100% renewable energy in the United States is achievable by 2050](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/here-s-roundmap-get-us-run-100-renewable-energy-2050/). And frankly, we have no excuses, because other studies have shown [100% renewable energy around the WORLD ](https://physicsworld.com/a/a-global-100-renewable-energy-system/)is achievable by 2050. There are three sectors that I mentioned earlier that will be imperative in making lofty goals like these possible; economic, social, and political. Let’s go over them. 

Politically, lobbying is a huge problem, as[ Fossil Fuel giants pour money into the greedy mouths of corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/25/oil-and-gas-giants-spend-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-infographic/#6442f5017c4f) politicians to halt climate change action that would greatly affect Fossil Fuel Giant's profits. First off, [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/) from Corporations must be cut off from the government- and I mean the entirety of the Government, not just Presidential Campaigns.  Then, a complete switch of executive power in the United States to a President who supports a form of a Green New Deal to push the United States to a position where leading the world to a future of[ less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-heat-related-deaths) is needed. Unless those measures are taken, a future that locks in to 3 degrees Celsius of Warming is likely- and[ that would be absolutely catastrophic.](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_campaign=Redirect) But why us, some of you may be asking? Why do we have to step up when we see movements starting all around the world to oppose man made Climate Change? It's a simple answer.[ The United States is a world leader in CO2 emissions](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions). And after ten years of decline in emissions levels from 2005 to 2015, United States emissions aren’t decreasing at the rate they need to be, and have either plateaued or increased. Without a full reaction to Climate Change in the United States, full efforts around the world would be much less effective as we continue to cloud our judgement with the haze of fossil fuels.

But again- where does the 2020 Presidential Election play into this? 

Look.[ Clearly, we can't rely on Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++). Many of its members- and key ones, too- take payments from Big Oil and Fossil Fuel corporations that impede progress. Members of the Senate and House have been corrupted by these corporations,[ through lobbying](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-interests-have-outspent-environmental-advocates-101-on-climate-lobbying) and direct payments. It’s a shocking, sad reality- but money has taken priority over human lives and the future of our world as a whole. Also, AOC’s [‘Green New Deal’ didn’t even get through the Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-fails-advance-green-new-deal-democrats-protest-mcconnell-sham-n987506) (not that that was a surprise). What’s needed is the House and Senate to be in control of the Democratic Party- then clearly, a Green New Deal could be passed. As Robinson Meyer, a writer for The Atlantic who covers climate change stated, “Every additional Senate seat that Democrats take in 2020 could help them pass a Green New Deal. Sudden demographic change—such as a surge in enthusiasm among young voters—could push electoral math in Democrats’ direction.” [But that is far from a guarantee, even if it is possible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/). With that in mind, a Democratic President who is willing to take Executive action to push Green policies into place would be needed. Why not just wait until 2024, though, if it isn’t likely pass a Green New Deal in 2020? If you’ve been paying attention, you know we are living on time we don’t have. Every day that passes digs us deeper into the climate grave we are burying ourselves in. [Any possible executive action](https://thebulletin.org/2019/03/what-could-happen-if-a-democratic-president-declared-a-national-climate-emergency/) against climate change if the Senate and House aren’t controlled by Democrats will have to be taken. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a necessary step. 

Socially, communities must understand that creating change to stop climate change doesn't come from driving an electric car, or going to the local Farmer's Market. Creating Change includes stepping up to buyback power grids from private companies that inhibit renewable energies- as we’ve seen [in Germany](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/political-breakthroughs-brighten-outlook-for-germanys-grid-expansion#gs.is6vp3) (although there have been problems- see the link). When the electricity grids are put in government control, all of a sudden the interests are put into what the people want, and not what the private shareholders want- which is obviously more money. This is happening here in the States, not just Germany- [take Boulder, Colorado as an example](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/04/18/boulder-makes-68-5m-offer-to-acquire-xcel-energy-assets-as-it-works-toward-municipal-utility/). However, only one state in the United States has a completely publicly owned electricity sector. That state is Nebraska, where there are lower electricity rates than the national average. A greater push is needed to promote renewable energy in cities across the United States. People must decide whether climate action is important enough to them to vote in government officials who will create change- and if they do, they must go out and vote in that way! Those same people must also take part in stepping out of the fundamental free market property known as mass consumerism. I’ll let this quote from The New Republic explain it for you. 

“C40 Cities, a network of 94 of the world’s biggest cities, released a report on Wednesday estimating how much consumption habits drive the climate crisis. The results were staggering: In those nearly 100 cities, where a combined 700 million live, the consumption of goods and services “including food, clothing, aviation, electronics, construction and vehicles” is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gases. That’s nearly double the emissions from every building in the entire world.”

If you connect the dots, it’s easy to tell that a much more conservative, get-what-you-need lifestyle is a necessary part to implement into every day society if we are to slow climate change at the rate it needs to be slowed. So how does that relate to the 2020 election? Well, it’s pretty easy to tell that simply asking people to travel less and consume less won’t work. People need to elect in officials that will put policies in place to create the needed lifestyle. There must be a total infrastructure redevelopment in order to make this work. That includes greatly pushing public transit, reducing urban sprawl tenfold, increasing clean water supplies, and reducing food deserts so low income and lower class people can access the resources they need. Those lower income people also need to have less financial stress too- which we could see come into play through nationwide healthcare and a flexible living wage that would be different state to state depending on what an accurate living wage is in a given state. You see, the 2020 election is going to light a path that all of our futures will take. That’s especially true for the lower class that I’ve mentioned. They are the ones who will be most greatly affected by Climate Change, and ironically, they are the least responsible for Climate Change. Those with high amounts of wealth are the ones who most directly cause Climate Change, through travel and mass consumption, among other things. That’s why political austerity and tax slashes for the rich literally need to be reversed- taxes need to be placed on the rich in order to improve life for those who are least responsible for climate change but will be most greatly affected by Climate Change. Once that is achieved, the stages of a Green New Deal can be put in place to curb climate emissions and create new jobs. That includes massive investments in building public transit, creating city wide composting systems, building more affordable housing, redesigning city layouts to be more compact, and many more options that will [create millions of jobs](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal). This all connects back to 2020 because literally none of this can happen without communities coming out to vote for the candidates that will make this all possible. The social revolution that I have outlined can and will happen- but it all banks on you and 2020. 

Every person reading this and every person in the United States has a voice. But who’s voice is louder; the people’s, or the green bills in their pockets? Economically, money has the loudest voice in our current state. What is that current state, you may ask? Unfettered Capitalism. Around the world, free trade agreements, corporations, and political corruption influence our green future and our present society the most. Corporations and Fossil Fuel Companies are allowed to spread over the world and pump emissions into the atmosphere at catastrophic rates- a [2017 Guardian ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)article said that 71% of global emissions are caused by roughly 100 companies. Of those companies, fossil fuels are the worst- “ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988.” If those companies are allowed to run rampant all over the world, drilling oil and making billions while guaranteeing the deaths of millions, than we have slammed the door on our already closing coffin. But if a step away from unfettered capitalism is made towards a more government regulated business sector that removes the ability of corporations to lobby and places strict environmental restrictions on those corporations, then there is hope. Free trade agreements also greatly inhibit efforts to stop climate change, and they must be restructured in order to save the planet. Naomi Klein, author of ‘This Changes Everything (:) Capitalism vs The Climate’ stated, “As the free trade system was put in place and producing offshore became the rule, emissions did more than move- they multiplied.” Trade agreements are severely lacking in environmental regulations- and the Behemoth of trade agreements, the WTO, is the worst of them all. [Their website even says the following](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm): “The WTO has no specific agreement dealing with the environment.”  They even go further to say, “...the removal of trade restrictions and distortions can yield benefits both for the multilateral trading system and the environment.” These are just two among many environmental hypocrisies you can find on their site that I linked in above. [Green protectionism](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_req_e.htm) is a particularly fun one that inhibits local renewable energy efforts. Clearly, that’s barely brushing the surface but I do believe you see the point I’m trying to make; Unfettered Capitalism must be stopped in order to save our planet. The 2020 Election is the time for us to step up and vote in a leader who will see these problems and make the needed moves. 

All of these changes are possible! That much is clear. 

Yet here we are,[ pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/06/01/one-year-since-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/) (Which isn't enough, by the way) and[ pushing billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry through government subsidies.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them)

It's clear that the Trump administration isn't going to do anything to stop Climate Change- as I've helped illustrate, they encourage it. So when 2020 rolls around, GO VOTE. Vote for our future, and vote for our planet. I’ll never force on you who to vote for- but I’ll tell you one thing. The candidate I want to win? He’s not favored to win because of ‘electability’. :).

"Is ""Thousands of Americans are GOING TO DIE!!"" the right message to catalyze/ mobilize against climate change? How can we engage better?","With one of the biggest  challenges we face as sustainability professional is how to best  communicate the challenge faced without turning people off, I'd be  interested in comments on the below article.

&amp;#x200B;

First off,  I am not  sure many Americans would be too concerned with.  Especially if this is  50+ years away.  That is not a judgement of Americans, but there are so  many challenges right now that are arguably larger in size that they  can directly map themselves to.

Second, I really feel this  article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just  told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With  some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So,  how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we  surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

Given  this is our daily truth, and we are trying to engage as many people as  possible, I'd really enjoy hearing from the group about how and what we  need to do better if our goal really is to better engage and catalyze  change.",environment,1560748244,richbrubaker,2,2,True,2019-06-17 01:10:44

How to Make Wind Power Sustainable Again,"[https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/06/wooden-wind-turbines.html](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/06/wooden-wind-turbines.html)

&gt;For more than two thousand years, windmills were built from recyclable or reusable materials: wood, stone, brick, canvas, metal. When – electricity producing – wind turbines appeared in the 1880s, the materials didn’t change.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s only since the arrival of plastic composite blades in the 1980s that wind power has become the source of a toxic waste product that ends up in landfills.  
&gt;  
&gt;New wood production technology and design makes it possible to build larger wind turbines almost entirely out of wood again – not just the blades, but also the rest of the structure. This would solve the waste issue and make the manufacturing of wind turbines largely independent of fossil fuels and mined materials. A forest planted in between the wind turbines could provide the wood for the next generation of wind turbines.",environment,1560791008,1HomoSapien,0,1,True,2019-06-17 13:03:28
"Recycling uses more resources than it saves. A lot of recycled plastic actually ends up in the ocean. The environment would be better off it we stopped recycling, and put our trash into landfills."," 

Ever since I read [this](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm)  1996 New York Times article called “Recycling Is Garbage,” I’ve known  that government recycling of plastic, paper, and glass wastes more  resources than it saves, and that the environment would actually be  better off if we put these things into landfills instead of recycling  them.

Over the next [1,000 years](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm),  all of the garbage in the entire United States could fit into one  landfill that was 100 yards deep, on a piece of square land which was  just 35 miles on each side. Today’s modern landfills are [well sealed](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm), and when they are full, they get turned into [parks](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm). I live in Pennsylvania, which is the United State’s #1 garbage importing state. We keep approving [new landfills](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-19/news/0202190037_1_landfill-garbage-pennsylvania-rules), because we love the jobs and tax revenue that it gives us.

Well now we have [this](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/recycled-plastic-america-global-crisis)  brand new article from the Guardian, which shows that our recycling  hurts the environment even more than I had thought. It says that a lot  of the plastic that we put into recycling bins gets sent to poor  countries in Asia. Much of this plastic cannot actually be recycled,  either because it’s contaminated with food debris, or it’s the wrong  kind of plastic. These poor Asian countries mismanage much of their  garbage, and much of this plastic ends up in the ocean. [This](https://nypost.com/2017/12/12/10-rivers-are-responsible-for-90-of-the-plastic-in-the-ocean/)  other article, from the New York Post, says that 90% of the plastic in  the ocean comes from 10 rivers, eight of which are in Asia, and two of  which are in Africa. So much of the plastic that we recycle actually  ends up in the ocean.

If the goal is to virtue signal, then by all means, we should  continue to recycle our garbage. But if the goal is to protect the  environment, we should put it into landfills.",environment,1560797290,SquirrelHill1971,3,4,True,2019-06-17 14:48:10
"My friend and I have been circulating a petition to ban plastic bags in our city, and now we have been contacted by a local plastic bag manufacturing company to come in for a tour. What should we say/try to learn?","So far we have around 300 signatures ourselves and with the help of friends, and the org we're working with is collecting thousands more to present to our city council early July. Because of our efforts, my friend was interviewed on local news and has been contacted by a local plastic bag manufacturer to come in for a tour in a few days. I've researched the company, and they claim (credibly) that they recycle nearly all plastic waster on-site, and that all their plastics are recyclable. They also have a long record of volunteering and recycling efforts, which makes us believe that this company is one we could try to use as a model.

What we're less sure about is what we should try to learn from them, and what to say to them while we're there. We want to eliminate all plastic bags in our community, thus eliminating most need for them to be recycled (because most people don't/can't), but we think they'll try to convince us that it's possible to recycle all of them and that a ban isn't necessary.

A Fishing Trip in 2050,"A Fishing Trip in 2050

Seagulls chirped overhead as my son Cole and I walked down the old wooden pier. Men on either sides of us cast their lines and nets out in hopes of catching their dinner. One man pulls his net up and empties out the candy wrappers that had been caught in it onto the pier. He reaches down and picks up the slimy, faded orange wrapper of a Reese’s. A visible look of disgust on his face as he tosses it into one of the many nearby trash cans. Another man reels in his line to find a plastic bag caught by his hooks. He begins to tear apart the bag and throws it away. 

“Catching much today?” I say as I walk up behind Justin, one of the usuals on the pier. 

“The usual. A few bluefish, a crab in one of the traps, and a couple pounds of plastic.” He replied as he tied a knot around a new hook. “Currents heading out so not as much trash been washing up today.”

“Just heading further out” I replied in a somewhat defeated tone. 

We set up our coolers and tackle boxes a few feet away from Justin. I baited a few of Cole’s hooks and he threw them a couple meters pur from the pier. As I baited mine a seagull swooped just past us and into the water, grabbing what looked like a bread tie from the surface of the water. I tried to not think about it as I threw in my lure and began to retrieve it. It didn’t take long for me to snag a bag. I pulled it up revealing it to be an old Target bag. It’s faded colors telling me it must’ve been in there for some time before I snagged it. 

I walked over to one of the many bins labeled “Bags” and shoved it inside. As I walked bag I noticed Cole reeling in what appear to be a fish. I was startled that he had hooked one so fast and ran over to see if he needed help. By the time I got there though he had already pulled up the line. A bag had been snagged on the hook covering the fish but was easy to get off. Underneath it was a little pinfish not more than 5 inches. The bag had made it seem like a monster while he was reeling it in. It didn’t matter to him though as his eyes were lit up with excitement. He asked to hold it nervously as I took it off the hook. I agreed and pulled out my phone to take a picture. Just as I took the picture a gust of wind blew the bag back into the ocean. I walked over to the edge of the pier and watched as it drifted out to sea. 

“It’s okay daddy.” I heard from behind me. “I’ll catch it again one day.” I turned around and watched as he gently put the little fish back into the water. The murky green water absorbing the fishes silhouette in seconds. We continued to fish with little more luck besides the usual plastic. For us, it was a good day.

"Would you use an app that helps you stop ""wishcycling?"" Do you think such an effort would help solve the bigger problems recycling faces?","First off—hello Reddit!  After years of lurking I've been inspired to make an account, join the community and take personal action after reading the recent news about the recycling industry.  That said, I wasn't quite sure where to post this question—please direct me elsewhere if need be!  Otherwise, let's continue...

Recently I learned something surprising about my city of Gainesville—we don't recycle certain types of plastic!  In particular, I've been throwing plastic Starbucks cups into the recycling for years, and it turns out someone's been spending their valuable time separating them back out.

I never looked up my local recycling rules.  I know most of my friends haven't either.  And so when we recycle Starbucks cups they become wishcycling.  Wishcycling (where well-meaning individuals try to recycle items that aren't recyclable) is a much larger and more systemic issue that makes recycling more difficult, more expensive and potentially not economically feasible.  

Would you use an app that reads your location and helps you easily determine whether a bottle you want to get rid of is recyclable in your current city?  And if so, do you think that widespread use of such an app would help the recycling industry as a whole?

There are broader implications for this too.  If people are willing, the app could collect images of recyclables and data that can be fed into a machine learning algorithm—one that may someday be able to identify recyclables itself and further optimize the recycling collection process.  

So.  Worthwhile idea?  Needs tweaks?  Let me know your thoughts!  And check back if this interests you because if people are interested enough for me to start developing something then I'll chronicle my progress somewhere you can follow along.  Thank you Reddit!

### The greatest conservation success story in the 21st century is the exponential growth of protected areas–a primary defense mechanism against Earth’s biodiversity loss. In 1992, world nations signed an [agreement](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/international/cbd/index_en.htm) to create protected areas on the land and sea to preserve our nature and prevent biodiversity loss.  The numbers say we did it. With the efforts of more than 160 countries, 15% of Earth’s surface is now declared as protected.

BioStories - Educational Video Game about the Environment - Chapter 1 about Rhino Poaching," 

Hello everyone!

I'm a game designer working on an educational video game called [BioStories](https://www.biostoriesthegame.com/). This project started at the demand of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Secretariat (SCBD) in Montreal, which is a branch of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).

Our goal is to raise awareness around key biodiversity issues, especially among children and teenagers.

The game will be divided into separate chapters, each set in a different region of the world and tackling a different challenge. Chapter 1 is about the rhino poaching crisis that Africa is going through.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](1sao9hgrft331)

Players will play as a newly arrived ranger and will go through a series of missions where they will have to investigate crime scenes. Each mission is based off real-life cases to be as instructive as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The game will be free to play and available on mobile devices.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this type of media to engage the youth?

For the people working in biodiversity conservation, would you be interested to have this type of education tool for your own specialty?

We're trying to build a community around this project and would love to hear your feedback!

\*\*Description\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

""Solastalgia is the pain experienced when there is recognition that the place where one resides and that one loves is under immediate assault. It is manifest in an attack on one’s sense of place, in the erosion of the sense of belonging to a particular place and a feeling of distress about its transformation."" - Glenn Albrecht

&amp;#x200B;

The everyday intimacy of climate change often goes under-acknowledged. This short film explores the dislocation, grief, and longing we all feel from the changes happening to our shared home. Can we find healing in acknowledging and accepting the sorrow and pain we are experiencing?

&amp;#x200B;

This film is also an exploration of the brighter side of climate change, both as a lived experience and as an invitation to a better path forward. Can we find solace and a better future by once again expressing deep respect and appreciation for our living planet that gives us all life?

A Current Dilemma: Reusable vs. Disposable,"  


https://i.redd.it/fm0uvuvdhy331.jpg

It goes without saying – many of us adore morning coffee, be it latte, espresso, flat white or cappuccino. Some have it in a reusable cup at home while the vast majority of others will opt for a disposable option of their morning coffee as a handy way before work. But how many of us have asked ourselves a question “Are paper cups recyclable?” They are not. The most common type used for takeaway drinks cannot be recycled due to its plastic lining that prevents the paper cup from becoming saturated and falling apart. In fact, it will take about 30 years for the plastic lining to break up into fragments and around 100 years to break down entirely, but that’s only if the plastic has the perfect environmental conditions to do so. Unfortunately, right now only about 1% of disposable cups are recycled. The thing is, this plastic lining must be separated from the paper in the recycling process which makes recycling them difficult and costly. Most recycling centers are not even equipped to process them.

The fossil fuel lobbyist Bjorn Lomborg and his expertly crafted persona,"So.... I hate to admit it, but Bjorn Lomborg and/or the people behind him are *very* smart people.

His brand of climate change denial isn't denial at all, but a new brand called ""lukewarmism"", where he doesn't attempt to contradict IPCC or climate science *directly*, but instead cherry-picks facts to for instance ""show that you're focusing on the wrong things"" (bull).

The point is still the same though, confuse people as much as you can in order to let big oil/coal/gas make money. By (smartly and deviously) cherry-picking specific facts like ""more people die from tuberculosis than climate change"" he builds an idea that the problem is 'economic' and that spending money on climate change is basically 'wasted money'.

He associates with the much duller ""traditional"" denier Pielke Jr. who usually just posts his faulty research suggesting tornados/hurricanes aren't getting more common. Pielke Jr. has by comparison, already been caught lying several times in various ways.

26 yrs to fix Earth,So scientists are saying that there’s only 26 years left to fix what we’ve done. But still nothing seems to be getting done. There are so many loop holes in shit that it’s a up hill battle. For instance did u know that paper mills all over the US get paid millions of dollars for using “Green energy” because they use a by product call black liquor. This black liquor burns worst the gasoline. That’s just one thing. Not counting the money that the Baltimore city dump gets for relatively the same thing. America just broke a carbon record and spring is pretty much non existent here in Maryland. Home of the rain now. Is any one else really fucking aggravated by all this shit. I think we need to organize a march in DC or something. We got to get a movement started. EVERY ORGANIZATION IVE CONTACTED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ASK FOR MONEY AND DO NOTHING!!

Handling Climate Change -- An opinion,"Greetings,

I had a few thoughts I wanted to share on my take of handling climate change. 

There are so many people concerned about climate change, and so many ways of handling components of the problem. Perhaps those who know climate change is real are approaching the issue incorrectly in how to make change. Our strategy being incorrect to handle the problem. What I disapprove of the most about how we handle it is any air of optimism about the issue. We are happy that small change happens, we are happy that some things happen however insignificant they may be. I feel like we aren't doing enough to invoke Sun Tzu's ""death ground"" doctrine -- where warriors fight 2 or even 3 times as powerful than they normal when placed with their backs to a wall. 

I feel now is really the time to drop any positivity, and drive home without any uncertainty that our days are numbered. We need a seize the moment aspect to our approach, in the same way as Cortez invoked when he sunk his ships in Mexico. That it is now or never. I don't think anyone has done an effective job of that. Sure the scientists give timelines and warnings etc, but how do I convince an idiot in Alabama that the world will burn until his mother dies of heat stroke? 

I feel like we need to drop the optimism, it never got us anywhere in the past, it won't get us anywhere now.",environment,1559684012,ODST515,2,2,True,2019-06-04 17:33:32
How Much is a Glass of Milk Worth to you?,"Did you know that cows in dairy production have a lifespan that is about 20% of the natural cow lifespan? (Gaard,“Toward a Feminist”). Most people drink cow milk and consume dairy products without considering the conditions cows go through to produce milk for human consumption. I too am guilty of consuming dairy products obliviously. The cruelty in dairy farming is something I only recently became aware of. After learning more about dairy farming, I told my friends about some of the things I learned, and they were just as shocked about dairy farm conditions as I was. Not enough people know about dairy farms and eat dairy without knowing the effects dairy consumption can have. 

The conditions cows live in on dairy farms are unsanitary and cruel. At fifteen months of age, dairy cows are artificially inseminated and begin a cycle of endless impregnation and lactation (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”).  To increase profit from the animals, farmers regularly inject hormones into the animals to unnaturally speed up the gestation process (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Dairy cows are milked two to three times a day by heavy machinery that can be painful and cause infections to the animals (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). All of the unnatural conditions dairy cows go through during the production of dairy shortens their lifespan. The natural lifespan of cows is twenty to twenty-five years long. The lifespan of cows in dairy production is typically four to five years, making up about 20% of what the natural cow lifespan is (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Many people are not aware of the damage that is done to cows during the forced production of milk.

Human consumption of dairy products has resulted in dairy farms taking advantage of animals for profit. Conditions of dairy farms and unjust treatment of animals on dairy farms can improve if humans consumed less cow milk. Human consumption of cow milk is unnatural, the human body is not biologically fit to consume cow milk (“Is Drinking Milk”;Wiley, “Cow Milk”). The human body naturally stops producing lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk) in middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Most humans cannot consume dairy without having digestion issues after middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Cow milk is a good source of Calcium and Vitamin D, but the consumption of cow milk has no direct health benefit for humans that we can’t receive through other plant-based foods such as soy milk (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”;“Is Drinking Milk”;“18 Non-Dairy”). Soy milk is a plant-based food that essentially has the same health benefits as cow milk. Soy milk contains the same amount of calcium as cow milk and is also a good source of Vitamin D (“18 Non-Dairy”). Some other foods that offer the same health benefits as cow milk are kale, broccoli, chia seeds, almonds, and figs (“18 Non-Dairy”). By switching to other dairy alternatives, like almond or oat milk, we can greatly reduce the negative impact humans contribute to the dairy farming practice. The torture and bad conditions that cows face to produce milk for human consumption is an issue that doesn’t get enough attention. I encourage you to share this information with your friends and help bring awareness to the poor conditions of dairy farms.

Funding green living though Carbon Tax,"Wrote this essay for my political science class and was curious about others opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the late 1800’s, the past 5 years have been the hottest years on record and the temperature keeps rising. As humans, our effects on this drastic change is apparent, from a natural perspective, the largest source of Co2 comes from volcanoes generating 200 million tons of carbon annually, just our automotive and industrial activities alone cause 23 billion world wide in the same time frame (“Are Volcanoes or Humans Harder on the Atmosphere?”). Solving Climate Change is going to be a long and difficult process, our modern and comfortable ways of life here in American would be altered completely but if left undealt with, its estimated that Damages could be as high as 20% of worldwide GDP, if action is taken it would only cost 1-4% of the GDP by 2030. Being that buildings are responsible for 38% of all Co2 emissions (“How Buildings Impact the Environment”), changing the way American housing is handled would prove to be very beneficial to reducing this number. For example, by increasing the use of individual green energy systems such as household solar power and decreasing the use of exposed concrete in cities are both simple ways a positive impact can be made. 

Before we look at the ways we can help decrease the impact of buildings, it's important to figure out where funding for projects of this magnitude could come from. Creating restrictions such as a carbon tax could prove to be beneficial. The Carbon Tax method can be seen in use worldwide (26 programs total) and is proving to have good effects on the economy and environment alike. The B.C Government's Carbon Tax Brochure describes the idea behind the method, “Tax the pollution we do not want, and return the money for what we do want - money in people’s pockets, jobs and investment.” This taxation does a good job of making the transition to a healthier environment without putting the US more in dept to ourselves. When looking at incorporating a National Carbon tax into a nation so diverse in an industrialized sense, places that are heavily industrialized or have a large population such as Texas or California, would be receiving more funding for the more improvement needed. In the end this method would create a lower and more equal carbon footprint among the states. British Columbia is only one of the many places that have taken advantage of this system. With these 26 carbon tax programs already in use, it can give us a good idea of what to expect from the system and shows that if done correctly it can be beneficial for both the economy and the planet. 

Now that the funding is out of the way, we can start looking at the changes that can be made to better our environment. As we progress further into the future, an abundance of discoveries and improvements are being made with the ability to have a substantial impact on how we go about making this change. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and more, are quickly becoming part of our energy mix but still only account for 11% of America's energy use (“The United States Uses a Mix of Energy Sources”). Increasing this number is an important step to a healthier future. When looking at housing in rural or suburban areas, the usage of rooftop solar is pretty logical being that plenty of open roof space is available, using the money collected from the carbon tax, we would be able to fund the installation of these household solar panels. With this method all excess electricity generated could also be pumped into the grid, further lowering the reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately highly Urbanized areas currently account for 20% of our overall carbon footprint (Miller), because of the lack of roof space available and the dense living population, solar as seen in more rural areas wouldn’t prove as effective. In places such as these, the new technology of solar windows could be a major contributor in the future of city energy. According to research at Michigan State, the United States could get 40% of its electricity from solar windows, the University estimates that 5 to 7 billion square meters of usable window space is available, when paired with 15% efficient panels, that 40% could be achieved. In practice, covering those billions of window space is substantial task to be achieved, nevertheless this surely goes to show how big of a role this technology can play in future green cities even if used on a smaller scale.  

Moving away from solar, other building techniques have been proving beneficial to lowering the impact of urban areas. The Urban Heat Island effect has also had a substantial impact on the energy usage in cities. Compared to surrounding rural areas, its estimated that a city with 1 million people or more can be up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during the day and 22 degrees warmer at night(Donegan), much of this effect can be credited towards open concrete soaking up the sun's energy, windows reflecting and the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. With all the tall skyscrapers, the natural, cooling wind flow is also obstructed. In Nature, soil does a good job soaking up the rain, which on warm days, would be evaporated, in turn, cooling the air, with cities most of this rainwater just runs down into the sewer system. 

The introduction of window solar panels would help decrease the reflection of the sun's energy but besides that solution, looking to minimize the amount of heat soaking into the concrete would be beneficial. In Manhattan, there is up to 40 square miles of rooftop space, to help fight the urban heat, the NYC CoolRoofs program has reduced the temperature of 6 million square feet by painting the roofs white. On hot days the dark asphalt can reach up to 190 degrees, if the program continues making progress its estimated this would cool New York’s air temperature by 2 degrees (McKendry). Although just 2 degrees may seem like a small number, when put in conjunction with other methods, a noticeable difference can be made. Rooftop gardens have also been seen to make a difference, because of the water and heat soaking soil, the water evaporates creating cooler air and creating food in the process. Simple and cheap solutions like the ones listed above can have massive impacts when implemented on a citywide scale, in response to creating a cooler urban environment, the need for energy eating devices such as air conditioning would also decrease.

Creating an entirely green city would prove to be a task that may take many years but so far, we seem to be heading that direction. Using some of the methods above, digital designs of future sustainable housing developments are starting to form. Although sparse, neighborhoods are already starting to form providing to be a proof of concept, so far many are quite successful. Currently here on the Pacific Coast, a model eco-friendly neighborhood is being constructed with the goal of having little to no negative environmental impacts (no carbon, trash, and have sustainable water management). The success of developments such as this show that this change can be done, it's just the matter of time and commitment.

The change to a more Eco-friendly way of living is going to be a very long process, in order to make this change, we will at some point, need to give up many of our basic comforts we use so often. Totally changing how products are being manufactured would call for a major shift in the values corporations and civilians must follow. By starting this change from a place such as buildings and city design, we are able to make an impact without having to alter the basis of our economy relying on our industrialized ways. Other technologies are constantly improving and becoming more viable with helping this change. With more and more communities, programs, and research going into solving this issue, we are surely going to be seeing change for the better within the future.",environment,1559704662,Tobias_Muldoon,1,2,True,2019-06-04 23:17:42

So, I've tried to be conscious of the environment my whole life. I'm not great at it. I don't deserve any commendations. Just trying to leave no/minimal carbon footprints.

(I am a vegetarian but I don't include that towards my love for the planet, I just don't care for meat and cows are adorable.)

Also continuous exposure to salt water degrades it faster, the other half of the equation where we have to clean up the existing waste is that we propose a deal with the fishermen, AN AMOUNT OF STANDARD NETTING MATERIAL TO EQUAL AMOUNTS OF ECO-NETTING MATERIAL. Meaning that for netting material turned in they can opt for exchange with eco-nets. The fishermen need not spend any extra money and can continue as they would with normal ones.

American Gypsy Herbalist- CREATING VALUE OUT OF YOUR LAND,"Good Afternoon r/environment!  


My name is Zach Champ and I am a fellow conservationist, environmentalist, and writer/editor for **American Gypsy Herbalist (** [https://www.americangypsyherbalist.com/](https://www.americangypsyherbalist.com/) )**.** 

https://i.redd.it/qvjofjcpdr231.png

I wanted to share an article I wrote recently that I think discusses an important concept. When we talk about Environmentalism and protecting ecosystems I think the discussion often misses a crucial point which is individual attitudes towards land ownership. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way we perceive the land we own, manage, and have access to determines ultimately our interactions with it. One of the things I am a huge proponent of as an environmentalist and conservationist is the idea that **LAND IS SACRED**. This is partially why I created the brand American Gypsy Herbalist which bridges topics related to Herbal Medicine, nature, conservation, and spiritualism. To me, all these topics are interdependent and interrelated! 

&amp;#x200B;

If people understood that the land we inhabit was sacred, then maybe we would be more conscious in our actions relating to the land. I wrote this article on **LAND STEWARDSHIP** which I think is an important Conservation Ethic. I want to spread awareness and understanding of this concept so people can apply this Ethic to their own Land ownership and management practices whether they are regular homeowners in the suburbs with a humble plot of land or if they are owners of significant acreage in the country! 

https://i.redd.it/4bccbycmdr231.jpg

**Here is an excerpt from the article:**   


""It is important to realize that when you own land you own more than just a house and a yard- you own a part of the environment, especially if you own significant acreage. It is important that landowners realize the importance of private land holdings as being integrated and connected with the ecosystem- even if they are not near a park or a forest. All land is connected to the local ecosystems and ultimately in one large biosphere. Therefore it is important for landowners to realize this and to have a concept of land stewardship.

**What is land stewardship?** Land stewardship is a belief and methodology that at its core is about responsible and productive ownership of land. If you own land, you have a *responsibility* to maintain the natural setting. You also have the right to make productive use of your land. A good land steward knows how to make continued sustainable use of their land while keeping its character and essence in place for future generations to inherit and appreciate. A good land steward recognizes that it is okay to cut trees for timber from a forest on their property, but they would never *clear-cut* the forest in its entirety. It is through good land stewardship that we as landowners can maintain native eco-systems, encourage wildlife habitation on our properties, and profit from nature’s rewards!""

&amp;#x200B;

***What do you all think? Have you heard of Land Stewardship before?*** 

***Do these attitudes and beliefs shape how you handle the ownership and management of YOUR property?***

But today as I was speaking to my mother about how the world might potentially end in 2030, she laughed and dismissed it.

Honestly that part blew my mind, how could she said that all these are all part of God’s plan. Humans have the power to stop it.
After that I told my friends about it— I initially thought that they would have the same views as me. But no. She told me the same thing as my mother, that it was God’s choice if he wanted people to die. Another one of my friend told me that it’s inevitable. That people would not try to save the earth, and it’s not possible to change the situation.

"The ""we have 12 years to fix this"" meme might be the last nail in the coffin.","You see it constantly: The last IPCC report mistakenly quoted as saying we have 12 years (now less) to do something about emissions. What the IPCC report actually says is that we must start reducing emissions immediately, and picks out 2 time points, 2030 and 2050, to illustrate the timeline (45% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 for a good chance to keep warming under 1.5C).

In order to get to a 45% cut by 2030, we have to cut about 4.6% per year, every year, starting this year. Instead, emissions are still rising. Even if emissions were flat, we would no longer have 11 years after this one to cut emissions by 45% because we will have failed to cut this year.

Really what the report told us is that the 1.5C ship has already sailed. Cutting that much emissions would tank the economy, which very few people want.

Antibiotics found in some rivers of the world exceed 'safe' levels in the global study.,"  

Researchers searched for 14 normally utilized antibiotics in streams in 72 nations across six mainlands and discovered [antibiotics](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-earth-science/) at 65% of the destinations observed. Metronidazole, which is utilized to treat bacterial infections including skin and mouth infections, to surpassed safe dimensions by the greatest edge, with concentrations at one site in Bangladesh multiple times more prominent than the 'safe' level. 

In the River Thames and one of its tributaries in London, the researchers identified a most extreme all out anti-infection centralization of 233 nanograms for each liter (ng/l), while in Bangladesh the fixation was multiple times higher. The most predominant anti-toxin was trimethoprim, which was identified at 307 of the 711 destinations tried and is basically used to treat urinary tract infections. The exploration group contrasted the observing information and 'safe' levels as of late settled by the AMR Industry Alliance which, contingent upon the anti-infection, go from 20-32,000 ng/l.

"r/environment, please help me to bring some change to my school.","Hello everyone.

I am currently in 6th form at school in London (for those who don't know the British school system, 6th form is the final 2 years of school prior to University), and I have decided, at 2AM, that it's time to act on my motivation to sort out my school's current environmental situation.

Soon, I'm going to have a meeting with a few teachers high up in the school to attempt to reform the school into a genuinely more environmentaly friendly establishment, because, frankly, I'm completely sick of the school's half-arsed attempt to become more green by sticking up some shitty posters about not buying plastic water bottles, as they continue to sell and package fruit in single-use crap. There are some major problems I have identified from being in the school that will be easy to solve, and some not as easy.

For starters, my school's recycling system is pretty much non-existant. Which I would say is disgraceful and lazy, it's really not difficult to set up a functional recycling bin system. This should be relatively simple to solve. Another serious issue I've listed is the ridiculous over-use of single-use plastics in the school. The school canteen sells tens of products wrapped in plastic, in plastic cups or in a plastic box, only for it to be thrown in the bin about 10 minutes after it was bought. This issue is a little harder to solve for me, as it is difficult for me to provide the school with some sort of easy alternative that they can deliver food in. Does anyone know of something I could suggest to the school as an alternative? 

There are some things I can't be sure of, like energy usage, but maybe in the future I would be able to try and reform this.

At the moment, I'm really sick of seeing no one giving a shit about this at my school. Unfortunately for me, I don't have a huge amount of leverage with them, seeing as they are a school and I am a single student. I'm still hoping I can make somewhat of a difference. 

Thank you very much.

Have y’all really changed?,"The current crisis of our society is Climate change at the moment, but what’s is the point!? It is hard to believe that people like Leonardo DiCaprio are advocating for us to change our ways of living when he tells us to stop using gas cars as he continues riding his private jets, it’s just hypocritical.

Even now, I may agree that the crisis we are in now is really bad, but honestly, I haven’t changed my ways of living at all. I still take long showers, I don’t use renewable energy, and even now typing this on the computer is contributing to climate change. How? The electricity powering my pc is from a fossil fuel power station which just released more carbon into the atmosphere.

People around the world are skipping work, class, and other important activities to protest for climate change. It sometimes works, but thick headed governments who refuse to make legislation for climate change ignore the issue. And all that protesting which made you miss work and school was for nothing. 

Don’t get me wrong here, I want to solve this issue very badly so we can move on a solve other major world issues, but climate comes first to ensure we even have a future! My problem is that are we even doing the right thing? Are you doing your part to slow down climate change? Even so, I believe that even if we have 5% of the world change to renewable energy it still won’t be enough, we all need to contribute and kick in, the reason I haven’t changed is due to the fact that I question if it even makes a difference. One person changing their ways of living in order to combat climate change is pointless, how about billions of people changing their ways of living, Nope, I think that it’s is impossible.

Inter-University Climate Movement,"Hello all,

I am a student at the University of Michigan who, like many of you, is deeply concerned by our government's inaction on Climate Change and fearful of the world myself and our future generations will live in. My post is somewhat US-centric, so apologies to our foreign neighbors. I am also speaking to the students and young people among us, but I welcome everyone to read.

Many of you have heard of climate protests in Europe, in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, China and around the world. Some of you may have participated in such protests in our own country, the United States. And yet, as inspiring and ambitious as all of these protests are, I cannot help but feel that they are all too often extremely vacuous, that we are simply shouting to the wind, unheard by those who hold the power to make real change. 

But it need not be this way. If we look to history we can find countless examples of civil disobedience movements bringing about revolutionary change. We can look to the Indian independence movement which brought the world's greatest empire to its knees and liberated hundreds of millions. We can look to the great heroes of our mid-century civil rights movement, which won freedoms for African Americans and other minorities that had been denied for centuries. We can look to the womens' movement which has massively expanded womens' rights after countless millennia of oppression. So many of these movements, whose results we too often take for granted today, were instigated and supported by young people and students like ourselves.

I am seeking to build such a movement for Climate Change today. 

We must seek out and promote the great orators of our generation, those who can persuade the American people and its politicians of the inherent urgency required to address climate change. We must build a national, inter-university infrastructure that is capable of applying acute political pressure wherever it is needed. We must be capable of holding mass protests, walk-outs, hunger strikes and marches of millions not just once year, but at the first indication that our demands are not being met. We must seek dialogue with politicians of all political stripes, at all levels of government. And we must bring into the fold all Americans with a fervor for action in their heart. We must help them realize the changes they want to see, the changes which are necessary to keep our planet livable.

Every generation before us has shirked their responsibility. The burden is ours now. We must carry it together.

TL;DR: We need a muscular climate movement capable of applying political pressure wherever it is needed if we are to take real action on climate change. I am seeking to organize such a movement, and am asking for your help. 

I will be reaching out to all relevant organizations at my university to organize this movement starting tomorrow. I will see about being published in my schools newspaper, and I will also be posting in dozens of other subreddits and on all other forms of social media to get the word out. I ask that all of you do the same. This cannot be a movement sprouting from a single mouth, or out of a single university. From the start, we must be a national, inter-university movement. If there is anything you can do to contribute to the cause, please PM me your details and I will begin constructing a listserv (at least your email, but phone numbers or other forms of contact are welcome).",environment,1559328050,Planningprotest,0,1,True,2019-05-31 14:40:50

Is a homeless man unable to chop down some trees to build his own house in place of those trees?

Since wood only grows on surface, and all but near surface of tree is dead, wouldnt it have many times the surface area in tightly packed thin trees? Couldnt you convert near any amount of dirt into a dense 3d block of wood in a few months if things added? For example, light diffuses in fog, so if it were very foggy in the dense block, light might get through even when no direct path, and fog counts as watering. Frequencies?

Squirrels and birds seem to be the most efficient food finders, picking through stuff.

You don’t hear this on mainstream media,"Global warming and scaremongering !!

Abstract
A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation. The primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a nontoxic, colorless, odorless gas. Water vapor accounts for by far the largest greenhouse effect (90–85%) because water vapor emits and absorbs infrared radiation at many more wavelengths than any of the other greenhouse gases, and there is much more water vapor in the atmosphere than any of the other greenhouse gases. CO2 makes up only a tiny portion of the atmosphere (0.040%) and constitutes only 3.6% of the greenhouse effect. The atmospheric content of CO2 has increased only 0.008% since emissions began to soar after 1945. Such a tiny increment of increase in CO2 cannot cause the 10°F increase in temperature predicted by CO2 advocates. Computer climate modelers build into their models a high water vapor component, which they claim is due to increased atmospheric water vapor caused by very small warming from CO2, and since water vapor makes up 90–95% of the greenhouse effect, they claim the result will be warming. The problem is that atmospheric water vapor has actually declined since 1948, not increased as demanded by climate models. If CO2 causes global warming, then CO2 should always precede warming when the Earth's climate warms up after an ice age. However, in all cases, CO2 lags warming by ∼800 years. Shorter time spans show the same thing—warming always precedes an increase in CO2 and therefore it cannot be the cause of the warming.",environment,1559383063,James70001,8,0,True,2019-06-01 05:57:43

A Deep Dive into Solar Panels.,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

Can Bees Build Soybean Yields? Can Bees Build Soybean Yields?," [https://www.farmprogress.com/soybeans/can-bees-build-soybean-yields](https://www.farmprogress.com/soybeans/can-bees-build-soybean-yields) 

 

Three examples of earlier research include:

* Australian researchers demonstrated yield increases of 10-40% in honey bee-pollinated soybeans, compared to self-pollinated beans.
* In 2005, a Brazilian research project compared soybean seed production with and without honey bee colonies by raising plants in cages, and reported 50% higher yields when bees were present.

Some want to argue that seed crops that self pollinate and roundup ready don't need bees and thus spraying millions of gallons of the weed killer does no harm to the environment and all news to the contrary is BS.

Question about Pollution,"I took an ecology class and throughout all the talk of climate change my professor reassured us by saying things aren’t as bad as they were in the 70’s and 80’s. “Every city isn’t plagued with smog thanks to the Clean Air Act and when was the last time you saw the river burn?” (I’m from the Cleveland area for context) But that only got me thinking about how business has changed over the years. In the 70’s and 80’s more of the stuff we bought was manufactured here in America. There appears to be a correlation between when environmental protections came into play and when all of our jobs were being outsourced to other countries. Is it wrong to say that we haven’t fixed the pollution problem to the degree we think and that we just moved the pollution to take place somewhere else? Major chinese cities are plagued with smog all year long but I don’t think they were like that in the 70’s and 80’s. I don’t know much about more recent Chinese history except for that one part they themselves don’t want to hear, had something to do with protests and a couple of tanks idk. Long story short, is it safe to say we didn’t stop that magnitude of pollution, we only moved it to effect other countries we don’t care about?",environment,1558838372,Harpo1999,1,5,True,2019-05-25 22:39:32

From a companies perspective they want to to deliver products safely for the cheapest price.

Live after Playstation Vue - YouTube TV,"I was happy (for the most part) with Playstaion Vue for its quality, channel selection and local stations.  The GUI on Roku, web browser and app were ok and at times frustrating.  As you probably know, PS Vue is shutting down next year and I have found my alternative.  One of my requirements was local channels.  Sling TV is out because of that.  I don't like ATT Now, specially their quality, speed and DVR offering.  Hulu with Live TV seemed like a good option (since I subscribe to Hulu) but their DVR and not being able to skip commercials turned me off.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter YouTube TV.  Local channels, comparable quality and channel lineup.  Plus all of these added bonuses:

&amp;#x200B;

Customize live channels  - something I hated about PS Vue.  It always showed me Fox News and Sports.  Which I don't watch any of those.  Now I can sort and hide channels I don't like.

Learns from what you watch - if I watch a lot of Food network, it is always showing me shows from that channel.

Can watch a show while it is recording (Roku) -  Once a show started recording in PS Vue, you could not watch it simultaneously (at least some networks)

Can change speed of video - want to watch a show 1.25 times faster, no problem.

Can see thumbnail when going forward - I can see when the commercial ends!

More controls on the Roku (down arrow, double down arrow) - down once, see networks and more choices, down twice can see other channels, etc...

Unlimited DVR - not unlimited but 9 months.  Better than PS Vue which was pretty good already.

Fast fast forward (does not take long)  - Roku PS Vue, skipping had a delay of a few second to resume show. YTTV is a lot faster.

Big bold live channel grid - not a traditional grid, but I like it a lot.  Both on Roku and app.

Show reminders on your phones notifications - I can be reminded of my shows airing in my app.

Phone app has PIP - at least on Android, I can have a picture-in-picture while I do something else on my phone. 

&amp;#x200B;

What started in Vegas spread to Silicon Valley—and all our mobile devices,"Mobile app design has scary parallels to casino design. Without realizing it (in most cases), app developers are tapping into the same base desires that drive compulsive gambling.

Listen to the podcast episode from Tristan Harris and Humane Tech: [What Happened in Vegas](https://your-undivided-attention.simplecast.com/episodes/what-happened-in-vegas)

This topic is so important.

**Designers** need to understand the impact their choices make. We have to go beyond AB testing and think about how these design choices impact the lives of real human beings.

**Companies** need to understand the damage these designs do to people's lives. We have to go beyond just seeking profit and focus on building companies that positively impact the community.

**Users** need to understand the dangers they face. We have to stop mindlessly embracing convenience and think about what is best in the long-term.

Problem With JBL Charge 3,"I bought this JBL Charge 3 in 2016, at Media Markt, in The Netherlands. After 6 months, I got a problem to charge.

After 1 year, the speaker got problem and the sound started to play terrible, like the bass was damaged.

I tried to change for another one or at least, to fix it without any cost, because the insurance was already expired and they said to me that the insurance and warranty was about the first device and not the one that they changed after the first problem taken.

Smart TVs suck and are totally worthless.,"The *idea* of a smart TV is genius; being able to have streaming apps built into your TV so you never need another device hooked up to it should be fucking awesome. But unfortunately, every single one I've seen has been an expensive piece of garbage, and nothing more.

The main reason? They are fucking *slow as hell!* I usually have pretty good internet speeds in my house, and a normal computer, phone/tablet, or video game console can perform very well with these same streaming apps. Plus they can do a whole lot more (play games, download/upload stuff, create stuff, play CDs/DVDs/Blu-rays/4K Ultra HD discs, call and text people, etc.)

However, you try to use a smart TV with the same WiFi network, and it'll take endless tries before it even connects, then installing the apps takes an eternity, and every time you want to load something up it'll take like 40 years before you can watch your movie or show, with 10 minutes of buffering every 2.5 seconds. A lot of the time the picture and sound quality aren't very good either.

I've had 2 smart TVs before, both Samsungs (the ""premiere"" STV brand, supposedly). One was from 2012, and the other was from 2015. I've also had a Samsung Smart Blu-ray player from 2012, and the ""Smart"" aspect of that was also a total bust (though the Blu-ray player aspect read discs really well, and had good picture &amp; sound quality).",technology,1570523248,hunter_da_hammah,20,0,True,2019-10-08 04:27:28

What is a particularly unique setup you have on your computer that you think not many people use?,"For example, I have my mouse cursor size set to be extra large (even though my eyesight is fine), because I accidentally set it once and after a while, I liked it and it’s been years and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

As another example, on my desktop email client, most people accept the default column arrangement of From, Subject, Date, Attachment, from left to right.

Internet Disconnection Problem,"&amp;#x200B;

So for roughly a year and a half I have been having an internet problem where it will stop working every few minutes.

What happens is I'll be on my PC doing something like playing a game or watching YouTube and it'll drop or cut out for a few seconds. My PC is hardwired via Ethernet. Obviously this doesn't sound like a big problem but when playing a game ill stop moving, run in one direction, etc. Sometimes ill be disconnected from the game but that rarely happens. Whats weird about it is that theirs a pattern but it isn't consistent. It'll stop working for 5-10 seconds and then shortly after it will happen again. Anywhere from 3-5 minutes later it will happen again. All day long. That's the pattern but where its inconsistent is where it will happen all day one day, a few times one day, and none one day. This problem only seemed to be happening on my PC so I did tons of research and the only solutions I found were to replace my router, my modem, and my motherboard. I also called my cable company to see if they knew how to fix it and they sent one of their guys by to fix it but nothing happened. Eventually I got tired of the problem and one by one I replaced each of these, each one I replaced did nothing to solve my issue. This all happened roughly 4 months ago. One day the problem just stopped; I did nothing and the issue seemed to fix itself. It thought that was the end of it.

Just yesterday I came home early from school because I wasn't feeling great. So I napped, did some homework and worked on a project. Around 3 my sister came home with her friend and the internet stopped working all together. This never happens and I did what I knew to do and I unplugged my router and modem and re plugged them in. 20 minutes after the problem arose it will still not working and what I did didn't solve the issue. Eventually after sitting there for awhile it started to work again. I got on my PC for the first time that whole week because I had been busy with school and doing things like going to the gym etc. I noticed my PC wasn't connecting to the internet and I waited until it finally did. And you'll never guess what started happening again. I thought that the disconnection problem had left me for good but nope, it begun happening again.

I made this post in order to finally find an issue for my problem because I don't want to have to deal with another 3 months of internet problems. If anyone could help me in anyway it would mean the world to me.",technology,1579973895,Shleapy,2,1,True,2020-01-25 12:38:15

"SMS from a disconnected (or fake/internet) number, New Scam or Stalker?","So last month I was out with friends and got a phone call from a number I did not recognize around 11:30 PM. I didn't answer the call though because I had just dropped my iPhone that week and busted my microphone (I know I sound like a mess), but I texted the number back and it went through as a green bubble (SMS) text. I got no answer, but since there were a lot of us heading to a new location I figured it was someone in the group I was with. It's been a little over a month and yesterday (Christmas) I got a text from that same number from a month ago that said Happy Holiday. I live in NYC and the area code is a new code in New York, 929. I replied ""thanks, who is this?"" got no response, and called them back to see if it was a friend of mine, but I got an interception message saying the ""customer is unable to receive calls at this time."" A second call gave me a different recording saying that ""This number is no longer in service.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am used to getting bombarded with spam calls which was a much worse problem earlier this year but seems to have lightened up lately, and I know they almost always occur during the daytime, not at 11:30 pm. I am also familiar with spam texts that usually have subscription messages, sketchy links, etc, but a simple ""Happy Holiday"" felt bizarrely human as though it could come from someone I know. But it somehow came from a disconnected phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

I did the whole internet search, looked it up on whitepages, etc, and cant find any single explanation or connection between this unknown phone number and any human or business. Is this a new type of scam? Is this an ex trying to get back in touch (an actual possibility given other signs)? I am prepared to block this number for good but **long story short, how did I get an SMS from an inactive number, and if it's spam, why does it seem so different from all the other spam I've received in the past???**

NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Masters Program — Similar Programs?,"I thought this question might be relevant here since some of us might be looking for a future in the field.

My friend in NYC told me I should look into the ITP at NYU. It looks fascinating.

[https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses)

Basically it covers a lot of ground in terms of the diverse application of new and emerging technology but keeps it within the creative domain.

Can anyone recommend a much cheaper/free comparative program? Many international schools have government-funded education that sometimes applies to international students as well so it does not have to be in the US).

*Note: I realize many of you are ready to recommend I take the ultimate free option and skip grad school. True. I hear you. That will be the case if there are no better options.*

My background: I graduated from the most competitive program in the #1 public art school in the nation and I am looking to swing the opposite way now. I am very good with computers and have a great deal of personal experience with them. Please keep in mind: I am not looking for this degree to set me up with a specialized tech job—I am more into using it to reach creative/personal goals like inventing. I have friends who are knee-deep in training their own coding/neural-network projects after going to grad school for tech following an undergrad in art.

Garmin Smartwatch Smartphone Notifications - asking current owners for help,"Hi everyone. 
I’ve a few questions regarding smartphone message/call notifications that I can’t find answers to anywhere and I’m hoping someone who already owns one can help me answer them:

1. Does the watch support WhatsApp (and other apps) notifications or only actual text messages? 
2. Can I reply to messages via the watch or only read them?
3. Can I answer phone calls and speak back via the watch? Or do I only get a notification that I have an incoming call?
4. Does the smartphone have to be close (reasonably close) to the watch to receive notifications? I’m assuming it has to be close by, but wanted to check.

I detect and analyse many different impurities during manufacturing process of  my product.

I look for a tool where I can easily store all the analysed data and ascribed them to the related process step with possibility to search and compare the results, for example:

One of the impurities was identified as "" plastic Z "" and it was found during the process step called ""A"". I would like to have an option  to search for example if   "" plastic Z   ""  was found during other process steps as well (based on the collected data).

Such tool should be accessible for at least 5 users.

Apple or Samsung? I need a new phone. I've thoroughly utilized my s9+ and it is dying a slow death.,"With Samsung, I get better resolution, louder speakers, a headphone jack, better camera, 1TB of storage (and it's expandable from there), larger battery, power sharing (extremely useful for Samsung's wireless earbuds), smaller cutout, fingerprint sensor, ect. There is a multitude of things that Samsung has Apple beat with...BUT...!

Apple has something that nobody has done. They have their own personalized OS (iOS) that can beautifully communicate with other iPhone users. Facetime, iMessages, ect. Their processor is impeccable this year (A13)! It may have a smaller battery life, but I feel like the smoothness of the software is built specifically so the battery isn't as big of an issue as it would be otherwise. It is missing a lot of juicy features that Samsung can offer, but should I switch? 

The majority if the people I know use an iPhone as their daily driver, and it would be much easier for me to relay info to them through all the different features set up for an iSheep. I don't *want* to become one, but I think I just might have to.

Interesting Ways of Lead Generation for Interior Designing Business,"Lead generation is one of the most talked-about aspects of every business. But what actually lead generation is and what techniques are used to generate leads need to be understood. Lead can be an individual or business that expresses interest in your product or service. 

A lead can come through many sources. Basically, lead generation begins the process which can transform your potential customer to a regular customer for more information and end up buying it. It is important for any business that wants to create a wide client base and increase their revenue and market share. 

If you are an interior designing firm, you need newer leads to sustain and grow your business. We have come up with some important information about lead generation and how you can apply them to your business. Have a look at them for better insight on how to generate leads for interior designing business.  Read more here : [https://leadsouq.com/leads-for-interior-designing-business/](https://leadsouq.com/leads-for-interior-designing-business/)",technology,1579445727,leadsouq,1,1,True,2020-01-19 09:55:27
High speed rail,"Is there anyone out there that is completely opposed to high speed rail?  If so, why?  

The only real downside I can think of is that the airline industry might have more empty seats, likely resulting in revenue losses and causing them to scale back their operations, and some airlines may actually go out of business because they can't figure out how to adjust to a new, lower demand for air travel.

&amp;#x200B;

I, for one, love rail but it's too slow and inconvenient (in America).  I can travel from D.C. to NYC faster than most trains and for cheaper.  Sure, I've taken the train once or twice so that I could get some work done during the 4-hour commute, but most of the time I just prefer to drive. 

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to planes vs trains, it seems to me like it's no question until you reach perhaps a 4+ hr train ride (depending on what your timeline is).  There's no such thing as a flight that is less than 4 hours, when you factor in check-in, security, boarding, and bag retrieval on the other end.  True, you can expedite with things like TSA pre-check and not checking in bags, things like that, but that saves you only 30-60 minutes.  

&amp;#x200B;

I can see many locations where this will be beneficial.  Miami&gt;Orlando&gt;Panama City (or Jacksonville, perhaps); D.C.&gt;Philly&gt;NYC&gt;Boston; San Antonio&gt;Austin&gt;Dallas; San Diego&gt;LA&gt;San Fran, just to name a few.  I'm sure there are others that could benefit (maybe in OH/PA).

We should stop worshipping Elon Musk and people like him," Now hear me out, I agree with Elon Musk on many things, I think that electric cars are the future and I really like the idea of Mars colonization, but there are things that make me dislike him. Few months ago I was one of the Elon Musk's fanboys, I adored him, I was thinking that he will save the humanity, I considered him ""the real life Tony Stark"" and was bashing everyone who would criticize him, but then I found out about that Thailand incident and was completely shocked, he literally called the British diver who saved the kids ""a pedo"". Yes, Vern Unsworth said that Elon should “stick his submarine where it hurts”, but that doesn't justify what Elon said, he was seriously accusing that guy of being a child rapist and what makes me really mad is that Musk didn't even properly apologize. I will bring up some points here of why we shouldn't idolize and worship Elon Musk.

1. He treats his employees horribly. This is not something new, Elon treats his employees like shit, he often fires people for saying something he doesn't like, he fired people for being pro-union, they work 100 hours a week, his employees were told to not walk past his desk, because of his wild firing rampages. And what I don't really understand is why people criticize Jeff Bezos for treating his workers like shit, while Musk is constantly praised for doing the same thing, that's hypocrisy! I’m not saying that Bezos shouldn’t be criticized for being a horrible boss, of course he should! I am just saying that Elon should be criticized for it too. [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/10/tesla-workers-union-elon-musk) [https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reportedly-terrified-tesla-staff-with-his-firing-sprees-2018-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-reportedly-terrified-tesla-staff-with-his-firing-sprees-2018-12)
2. He is an arrogant narcissistic egomaniac. He often insults people on Twitter, bans them for saying something he disagrees with, he insults his employees. he doesn't like when someone criticizes him, like that time he called that diver ""a pedo"", because the diver said that Elon's submarine will not work and that the kids will obviously get stuck there, which did hurt Elon's huge ego. And let’s be honest, that submarine was definitely a PR stunt. He didn’t even apologize properly for that “pedo guy” tweet. When he was ""apologizing"" he also “expressed his worries” that Unsworth “may be another Jefferey Epstein”, is it really that hard to apologize and not being a jerk? Steve Wozniak received an email from Musk that said, ""You are not a real Silicon Valley boy"", and no, Elon was not joking. Musk is not really a nice guy like media portrays him, he is a jerk with a huge ego. [https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-rants-against-elon-musk-and-tesla-2018-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-rants-against-elon-musk-and-tesla-2018-1) [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/11/elon-musk-faces-trial-after-calling-british-diver-a-paedophile](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/11/elon-musk-faces-trial-after-calling-british-diver-a-paedophile)
3. He is given too much credit. Yes, you read this right, he is given too much credit. Let’s be real, Musk is not a “genius”, he is not a scientist and definitely not Tony Stark like pop culture portrays him, he doesn’t build those rockets, he doesn’t build Tesla cars, his engineers and scientists do, Musk just knows enough about these things to run the companies. Elon Musk is a good entrepreneur and a good businessman and that’s not a bad thing, he has an economics degree and a degree in physics, and that’s it. Elon Musk is like Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs, but nothing more. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon\_Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)
4. He has a very toxic fanbase. Now this is not as much of a criticism of Musk as a criticism of his fanbase. They are like a big cult, for them Elon is saint, he is perfect in their eyes, “a demigod who will save the world!"" and unfortunately I was one of them. When Elon called Vern Unsworth “ a pedo guy”, his fanbase started defending Musk’s claims, they were saying that Unsworth “is definitely a pedophile, why would he live in Thailand, if he is not?”, this is just pathetic, that guy saved children and the only things he got are false pedophilia accusations and insults from Musk and his cultists. When Steve Wozniak criticized Elon Musk, Musk’s cultists started insulting him, they called him “a shill”, “a fat loser” and “a pig”. Woz revolutionized personal computers and they insulted him! When Neil Armstrong criticized SpaceX, Elon’s fanbase started calling him names. Do these people even know who is Armstrong? They just can’t take criticizm.

Elon Musk is a good businessman, but he is not a "" super genius"" and not our savior. Let's start thinking critically, people, because blindly folowing someone is never a good thing.",technology,1569595046,BruceWillis20,72,20,True,2019-09-27 10:37:26

What is Cloud Computing? Detailed Overview. Credits: DFI,"The terms cloud and cloud computing are used very often, but what is actually behind it? In this article we explain the different terms in an understandable way.

The term cloud has established itself as a short form of cloud computing .

Briefly summarized: The term cloud means the interaction of several servers. The servers take on tasks such as data storage or complicated program sequences. The cloud user does not notice how many servers are behind the cloud.

Even if one server fails, it has no impact on the entire system. This independence from the individual servers is therefore referred to as cloud, since the user does not have to have an overview of the individual units (cloudy / unclear for the user). The cloud is the big picture of these computing units.

Cloud / cloud does not mean that your data is only transmitted via “clouds” or satellites. Everything essentially takes place on Earth and your “normal” internet connection via radio towers, routers, cables and data centers is used.

  
Business Cloud: This term is used by this website to identify offers that are aimed at companies.

Cloud computing: see above, means the interaction of several servers that take on tasks as a whole and can provide storage space, for example.

Community Cloud: means the cloud as a (local) community project. A user group gets together and shares the costs for the project. For example, a community cloud from several universities or colleges is conceivable.

Hybrid cloud: A combination of the private cloud and public cloud, depending on individual needs.

[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) In contrast to PaaS and SaaS, IaaS takes effect at the lowest level, the hardware compilation. This cloud service provides you with servers that you yourself divide into your own virtual computer clusters , i.e. computer networks. You are responsible for the selection of any software.

[Multi Cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) Based on the idea of the hybrid cloud, several cloud offers are linked and bundled here.

Network Attached Storage (NAS): Any cloud software offers more than just storage and therefore goes beyond a NAS. However, if, for example, your own hard drive is made available via the router in the network, this is referred to as NAS storage space that is available via the network.

NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA): The US institute developed a definition of the cloud . More details can be found in the next section on this page.

[Platform as a Service (PaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/)PaaS acts between IaaS and SaaS on the 2nd level. You will have access to a completely set up software environment in which you can also run your own software, for example.

Private cloud: own computer structure or own cloud. This can be an in-house cloud or the small cloud server in your living room.

[Public cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/)IT infrastructures or a cloud that is publicly accessible. On our site, we also refer to providers as so-called cloud hosters.

[Software as a Service (SaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) is also referred to as software on demand. You can use selected software that runs on the servers in the cloud. You have only limited influence over the software. Some web applications, such as an online office offering, can already be referred to as SaaS.

[Virtual private cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) A public cloud is accessed via a local (virtual) environment. The protection is usually done by a VPN.

Even the processor it uses is octa-core MediaTek Helio P35 processor with 6GB RAM, which impressed me honestly, as my brother is fond of playing heavy games and such specs are amazing to get. Even the gamers are worried about the battery and my brother was also to which Tecno offered me 3500mAh and I was like, hey take my money and give this phone to me.

The Bytecoin Tech Rundown (new post format),"Dear users,

We always want to keep our community informed and updated. That's why we've decided to start making short reports on the technical side of our work to shed light on our current work and plans. This will help you observe our working process.

Here's a sneak peek at our recent progress:

1. We've been working on the desktop QML-based client. This release brings an updated design, as well as adds some technical tweaks. The release is going live, as planned, on July 4th with the name Beryl, and going to be one of our presents to the Bytecoin community (remember that Bytecoin is turning 7 this year).
2. We've been working on a new technical article about Auditable Wallets which is going to be posted soon. The primary purpose of this article is to reveal the topic and provide all the necessary information about this technology.
3. We've been finalizing some changes for the Amethyst v3.4.5 release. This release brings updates for miners and we are kindly asking all of our mining pools to update to the latest version.
4. All of you have been interested in how things are going with Ledger. We made a patch for Ledger firmware (version 1.0.1) and have sent it in for the review of the Ledger team. For now, we are waiting for their feedback and of course, we will keep you informed.
5. And last but not least, we've been working on an Ethereum Gateway, finalizing a failover-scheme of the EFT database.

Of course, there is a lot of technical information and maybe you find it a little bit boring but hopefully you like it nonetheless. Comment down below what you think or give us feedback on the types of posts you want to see.",technology,1560530669,BCN_official,0,0,True,2019-06-14 12:44:29

"Why is WeWork spending $1,002,000 buying every member a shirt when it's about to lay off 1/3 of its staff?","I work at a WeWork in downtown San Francisco and I've been following the company's slow implosion over the past few months. There are 2 other multi-story WeWork offices within a 2-block radius of mine. My floor has never been more than half full with tenants, and from what I can tell, that's true of all the other floors in the building as well. 

But here's my question: WeWork is scheduled to begin [laying off about one third of its staff this week](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html) and outsource its cleaning crews. They are $1.25 billion in the hole for just the past three months of operations. And yet - last month they replaced every single coffee mug company-wide with nearly identical, slightly smaller ones because the larger ones occasionally chipped. Today, they were giving out free t-shirts with custom WeWork designs to every member. [They have more than 600,000 members worldwide.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article237526214.html). 

I did some back-of-the-envelope math on the t-shirts and realized they had spent $1,002,000 buying them. Couldn't that have saved a few jobs? The employee who gave me my shirt looked like she could use job security more than a tchotchke.  

Here's how I reached that number if you're curious: 600,000 members x $1.67 per shirt, which was [the cheapest I could find for the brand they used: Next Level Apparel](https://www.shirtspace.com/next-level/t-shirts). That price is without customization, but I also assume WeWork negotiated a bulk pricing deal. WTF guys?",technology,1574217947,TheAmberAmazon,0,1,True,2019-11-19 21:45:47

I'm looking for a LAN/Network port extender for use at work. I have one spare network point but need two, one for the computer to access the domain and another for the telephone system.

I'm going to be a trucker and the discussion around automation is frustrating.,"Airline pilots have autopilot and auto land.
Cashiers work side by side with auto check out. Soon enough even complex jobs such as accounting and lawyers will be on the chopping block. It's no longer a question of which industry can't be automated, but which will have more years unchanged by automation.

I'd argue that self driving cars and the automation tech involved is ringing in everyone's years because people can relate to transportation much more than a job in air travel, retail, law, and finance. Perhaps a lot of you work or have worked in retail and do hear about more automation coming to grocery stores etc like how Amazon is doing it with their relatively unstaffed stores concept. But I'd argue that the volume of self driving news does not equate to a higher chance of impending automation even within the next decade. I've done a fair amount of googling and conversing and what truck driving may become is a semi autonomous system that still includes a driver as to limit liability at the source, otherwise, why aren't we flying planes and driving trains without their pilots and conductors yet? 

Furthermore, trucking and logistics LEVEL 5 (full self driving- no human intervention) automation is possible don't get me wrong but if it were to be implemented these driving systems would most likely be working in conjunction with non self driving cars where as planes would be able to sore through mostly empty space without their own pilots- but would you step on board that plane? And would you drive on the roads knowing there isn't so much as a human inside a vehcile?!

Are we living in the singularity?,"Do you guys feel that all the fear, divisiveness, and hate crimes is an output of the function of algorithms? 

Beginning with the start of television and news reporting, it quickly became the realization that reporting on and promoting fear raised viewership and income. Playing this out long term, we can see disturbed and easily influenced individuals acting on the fear created by these networks, thus creating more stories for the media to cover to create more fear and divisiveness. 

Now, onto why I think algorithms may be the cause of the growing international tension and terrorism. Algorithms because, as pointed out above, this same increased viewership and increased income created by fear that was successful for the TV networks was also successful for the internet. However, algorithms ran by a computer, which are millions of times more effective than humans running TV networks, has accelerated the fear, crimes, and seeming chaos to speeds that could not have been matched by television.

A website creator, blogger, business owner, developer, whatever you want it to be, can create an algorithm with the sole purpose of promoting content that increases viewership. This algorithm can then, over a period of time, realize that increased user interactivity and returned visits is created by promoting content containing political divisiveness and fear.

Because of the effectiveness of these algorithms and the data mined from humans through various methods, these algorithms can then figure out the even more deepseated fears that humans have, and personalize the content to be even more effective, essentially building upon itself to solve the task that it was first set out to do.

Is this the AI singularity we talk about being in the future? Is this how AI is going to destroy humanity; not by their own will, but by human's own stupidity to look at the present moment and realize what is happening. 

These algorithms are playing directly to the deepest fears set in every human. It's not even a moral decision of the algorithm, it's just what it was originally set out to do, now it has become so effective that no matter where you go on the internet, fear and divisiveness is always available.",technology,1565580043,postpartum-blues,2,0,True,2019-08-11 23:20:43

Sup guys! Need your opinion!,"Hello, my name is Ann, i'm engineer. We launched a project on Kickstarter this week and didn’t get as much backers as we were going to. I am so upset now and really want to understand what is the problem. 

Our brush concept:

1. Perfectly cleans teeth without the need of proper movements, because the toothbrush has 3 heads, that cover the tooth from all sides at the right angle and with the right pressure. Heads with sweeping rotations perfectly clean between teeth.

2. Since the brush cleans immediately 3 sides of the tooth, cleaning is faster - only 50 seconds.

Here’s our link: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brubrubrush/brubrubrush-toothbrush-that-perfectly-cleans-for-50-sec](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brubrubrush/brubrubrush-toothbrush-that-perfectly-cleans-for-50-sec)

Please write what do you think of this brush? Would you like to have it?

Unfortunately, the design of the brush is very complex, so its cost is still very high. Do you think we can sell it for 140$?

Let's list some important things to know for the future!,"Hey all,

From my observations it seems that our world exponentially grows toward digitization of many things; I wouldn't be surprised if technology related knowledge once not essential becomes a regular part of society, honestly. That's what got me thinking, as I'm sure that various skills would be awesome to know in the years coming out. What sort of knowledge would you think is necessary?

Off the top of my head, I've come up with a few things:

* General computer usage skills, what one would call ""tech-savviness,"" as in one must know how to operate computers in settings, and whatnot
* Scripting knowledge, not necessarily CS, but in this day and age, being able to whip something out in Python, on the command line/terminal would benefit all
* Security knowledge- if you follow the news, big breaches occur far more often than one would expect, at least for me. Again going back to savviness, I think it'd be awesome if most tried to put more security in effect with their passwords and such, whether it be password managers, etc.

Of course, I'm not particularly skillful in anything, so those are just my observations. I'm curious to see what your responses/thoughts are!

Cheers!",technology,1577251633,squirorb,4,1,True,2019-12-25 00:27:13

Replacing cheap usb game controller non-removable usb type A cable with a usb type-C cable,"I was wondering as a fun project, trying to replace the soldered usb A cable on the game controller with a usb c cable, that is just a usb 2.0. I has just 4 pins (data+,data-, ground and power 5v) but i was wondering if i could just desolder the usb A cable from the pcb and solder the new cable with the usb c connector, of course soldering the right 4 wires to their corresponding lines as usb A and C 2.0 has the same (usb c 2.0 cable and just remove the A connector and keep the cable with the C connector) 

Or i would need extra steps as soldering resistors etc as i am not sure if the protocol is the same and i can't find anything online as well, i am not a pro so i am not exactly sure what i am doing,

Thanks if you have any tips",technology,1568648244,robhug99,0,1,True,2019-09-16 11:37:24

"My phone is definitely listening to me, even while it's locked.","Ok so last week I was grocery shopping with my girlfriend and she mentioned she wants to try meal substitutes. A good friend of mine is in the process of using huel, so I mentioned it to her. Keep in mind I've never used it, never looked it up, and have zero interest in doing anything like that, but that night huel ads were all over my Facebook. So a few days later a coworker took a vacation day just because and so I asked what he did. He said he took his boys to top golf for some family time. Sounded cool and we talked about it for a minute but I've never been, nor have I ever looked into going to topgolf. I totally hate golf tbh. Again, that afternoon there were tons of ads on my feed for top golf. I've never seen any ads for either of these products on my wall before but they just happen to pop up on the same day?? It's totally freaking me out now. Anyone else have this or know of a way to stop it?",technology,1565158691,Danimal147,10,3,True,2019-08-07 02:18:11

My question really.
Can he somehow track it down if he signed in on her phone through his own account ? google services like google maps, , drive or anything google. 
Could he somehow get that iphone to register as a new device on his google account and begin tracking it? 
What does one have to do to get the google account to see that phone as their own and start tracking it?

Umidigi One: Review,"Coming from somebody who hadn't even heard the name of this smartphone brand until about a few months back, you'll be shocked to read what I'm about to tell you.

UMIDIGI.

Doesn't ring a bell, right? It won't because the visibility of big brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and now Realme is so huge in the budget to mid-range smartphone market that brands like Umidigi and Tecno have not been able to capture that customer attention yet. However, having analysed some of the phone manufactured by these brands, I can say that the products are worth giving a shot. You remember how everyone was buying a Xiaomi phone way before all the other brands that I have mentioned had made their appearance and how it became huge. Ofcourse, the smartphone market has grown to another level now and it's difficult to build that kind of a fanbase now. However, less popular brands like Umidigi also deserve a chance &amp; it can only happen because of customers.

Now Umidigi One for example is a great phone with a few tangible flaws, but still can't be discarded as an option. It's got dual primary camera combo + 16MP selfie camera + 3550 mAh batttery + 4 GB RAM + Fingerprint sensor &amp; Face unlock. The phone undoubtedly comes with the features almost competitive with other smartphones in the range. Coming to performance, the Mediatek chipsets have been long underestimated by people but the assumption by most is based on false word of mouth. I have tested the performance of many Mediatek powered phones and have found absolutely no problem. You won’t even be able to figure out the difference when compared to phones with other chipsets. Hence, I would rely on the performance of Mediatek Helio P23 which has quite a high clock speed to accomplish speedy multitasking.

So according to me…this smartphone definitely doesn’t have a lot of drawback but to be honest no smartphone comes without disadvantages. Hence, if it fulfils your requirements, go ahead and give it a shot.",technology,1579950511,pallavmohan1,1,1,True,2020-01-25 06:08:31

Network Analysis,"**Network Analysis** 

**1.** **What is Network Analysis?**

Network analysis is used for recognizing the most efficient routes or paths for allocation of services. This involves finding the least-cost way in which to visit a destination location in a spatial network. The cost in a network analysis is normally described in terms of distance or travel time. Network analysis can also be used to optimize the allocation of resources.

**2.** **What is shortest path?**

The best route or the route of least impedance between two or more points, taking into account connectivity and travel restrictions. 

**3.** **What is service Area?**

A network service area is a region that encompasses all accessible streets (streets that are within a specified impedance).",technology,1567488313,grace992,4,0,True,2019-09-03 01:25:13

Weird audio issue with earbuds... almost creepy,"Hey folks. I've just now noticed something going on with the bluetooth earbuds connected to my phone.

And it isn't constant, as it will cut in and out into complete silence. Almost like someone is tapping into them (which seems far-fetched as I know this isnt possible with the earbuds directly, but the sounds really make me want to think someone is tapping my phone which is creepy haha). Is this government surveillance, am I about to be assassinated? XD seriously though, does anyone know what might be causing this? It's still going as I finish typing.

Are electric cars at the highest level of efficiency as far as voltage?,"So from what I know when voltage goes up you make the battery you have work less burning energy off as waste heat. 

So when you run higher voltages you have more efficient running that uses less power. 

So that's why people like Tesla have 600 volt batteries. 
In my mind they choose to not go higher in voltage for a reason. 
I think any higher and the gains are minimum at best.  

There's nothing to gain for efficiency past 600v

Iphone or Android to hide activity/pics/msgs,"Long story short, I pay for my own phone but my parents go through it. 

Right now I have an old android and I know ways to hide certain messages and numbers by blocking and unlocking them or using private mode.

But when it comes to iphone, I wanted to get one but I like to keep things PRIVATE.

I want the least amount of activity to show up on my phone, apps, messages, pics, etc.

EXTREMELY creepy and weird noises coming randomly out of my headphones.,"One night I was casually staying up to 6 AM watching youtube videos/playing video games. When I stopped playing, I was thinking about life, and then very creepy and quiet noises started playing, it was like a ring sound, from ear to ear.  I thought I was hearing things, but then it got louder, and louder, and it got so loud I had to take off my headphones. I also checked if it was actually coming out of my headphones, it was. It sounded terrifying, I checked if I had anything playing on my computer. Nothing. I've found a song, that can maybe give you guys an example of what it sounded like. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3NnHI\_TfzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3NnHI_TfzI)

Does video games cause violence? My opinion on the case.," 

So in the past Donald Trump (The President of The USA) has been saying that the cause for the mass shooting at El Paso a few days back was because of video games, which I think is totally wrong.

Look, I'm just so sick of people being so quick on blaming video games as the main cause of a mass shooting or stuff like that. I do agree with you that some video games are a bit harsh and the fact that some games are too brutal for underage kids. But that doesn't mean that video games should take every hit. 

The whole point of video games, or at least most of the video games is that they give you another opportunity to experience other type of worlds that you wouldn't've even been able imagine in the real world. It just give you another hobby. 

Video games isn't just about shooting and killing characters. People play those kinds of games due to the action in that game, but that's only a small part of the reason why people play those kinds of games. People come there because they want to improve at the game, because they can socialize and because there's a ton of strategy involved. Most of us that actually plays shooting games doesn't really think too much of violence when we play our games, cause what's even the point of trying to think about it when I haven't hurt anyone at all it's all just pixels. When you're playing video games you have to learn the difference between reality and virtuality. You have to think about how you would've felt if you were in a situation like this in reality. And when think about the fact that you will always come back to life again like nothing had even happend right after wards in the game. It's almost like if u had just squeezed all the water out of a sponge, and again you can't actually hurt the sponge. And you could just drop it in to the water again and the sponge would be just about the same as when you squeezed all that water out. 

And now you're most likely going to say ""What about the mental health? You could've maybe hurt someone by that?""

Yeah, that might be. But think of it like this. There's violence of the stuff we do now a days, but of course those things doesn't any of the blame what so ever. Think about for example hunting, where we are killing animals, you are literally killing animals and still you ain't getting any blame what so ever just because they ain't humans and doesn't look like humans. And the thing about hunting, or for about everything for that matter we do in life we are either going to feel good about ourselfs or bad about ourselfs. On 1 side you actually managed to do something, but  on the other side, we just killed a animal. Almost everything we do in our lives got both a good side but also a bad side at the same time, and that same thing is in video games.

We're never been in a lower rate of violence than today, don't get me wrong, there's quite a lot of violence on going to this day still. But think about it, video games wasn't the reason why  WW1/WW2, The Russian Revolution, ISIS the terror organisation and many more wars and organisations accrued.

And don't take me wrong on this one either, but you can't expect that in a society like today with almost 8 Billion people is going to continue to behave all the time either. That's like saying to 8 Billion people to not open a door, that just wont work. There will still be people attempting to go threw that door.

People always blame something, before video games it was the TV's fault than before that it was the book's fault.... It's about time that we get to a end of blaming video games and what ever is going to be the next one and the one after that.

Oh and btw there is so many other games than just shooting games. Sometimes even those people that mostly play shooting games gotta take a break from their main game and chill out with some other games. Like Simulator games, Story games, task games, social games like VRchat where everything you do is go around and talk to people from all around the world. And so many more. 

I am truly sorry for those that passed away or has been effected by 22.July or El paso or any other shootings.

This will most likely spark a good bit of debate down bellow, but go ahead I wanna hear your opinion of it.",technology,1565652329,PinkSkiI,1,1,True,2019-08-12 19:25:29

"How Google can make ""iMessage for Android""","What I mean by the title is: Apple's iMessage is huge for Apple users. This is a simple way of how Google can make a special messaging system, without it being a failure (or as much of a failure as the previous attempts).

Just imbed it into the already existing Android messaging app! That's how Apple does it, so it has a better chance of working with Google, rather than the other attempts. With this, Android fans would be happy to see that there was a revamp in their messaging app that allows you to do more in Messages. By imbedding it into the Messages app, every Android user has access to it. You don't have to download an extra app, wait for your Android-using friends to download it too, waste space on your phone, and only be able to text Android users ONLY if they have the app, and no iPhone users.

Francis Menassa (JAR Capital): 5G will take technology to the next level,"Right now, the world is on the cusp of a connectivity revolution. Thanks to advances in technology over the last decade, and in particular, the Internet of Things (IoT), almost every new electronic device in the future will have the potential to be connected to other devices. Indeed, according to data and statistics group Statista, by 2025 the number of connected devices across the world will hit 75.4 billion, a 400% increase in the number of devices that were connected in 2015.   

One of the predominant drivers of this growth in connectivity will be 5G technology, which is currently being rolled out across the world. The latest generation of cellular technology, 5G offers super fast speeds and extremely reliable connections, meaning that it will play a key role in supporting new technology. 

Francis Menassa: the rollout of 5G infrastructure is still in its early days at present, a report from Cisco estimates that by 2022, 5G traffic will account for more than 10% of total mobile traffic globally, which suggests that in the next few years, technology could advance at a rapid rate. With its advanced data analytics and enhanced network edge capabilities, 5G technology is likely to create a broad range of opportunities for innovative companies and this could take technology to the next level. 

**Advanced technology**  

While some exciting applications of 5G technology such as self-driving cars are still a few years away, a number of innovative connected devices are already hitting the market. One example is the Coolpad Dyno Smartwatch – a state-of-the-art smartwatch designed for children. This watch is different from your regular smartwatch due to the fact it has features that can help keep parents connected to their children. For example, with this watch, parents can track their children’s location at all times, and set ‘safe zones’ with virtual perimeter alerts. If the child goes outside the safe zone, parents will receive an alert. The watch also has an SOS button on the side that children can use to call emergency contacts or 911. As technology continues to advance in the years ahead, we are likely to see plenty more unique products like this. 

**Product launch challenges** 

However, for the companies that are designing and manufacturing new electronic products, the launch process is not always easy. Seamless connectivity is required, yet there are hundreds of different network carriers across the world and each has its own complex IT architecture. This adds complications because electronics manufacturers often do not fully understand how to integrate their technology with each network. Furthermore, manufacturers need to ensure that their products are fully compliant with all security standards and regulations. Add in the negotiation of trade tariffs, and the challenges associated with providing international customer support, and it’s easy to see why the launch of a new product can be a challenging experience.  

**Platform solutions**

There is one easy solution to the challenges associated with product launches, however, and that is using an integrated service enablement platform. These platforms provide a range of connectivity services between manufacturers, retailers, and consumers which makes the process of launching a new product far more streamlined. 

The main benefit of using an integrated service enablement platform is that they provide a framework for carrier network and third-party integration, which makes it easier to scale up product launches. For example, a platform will provide manufacturers with connectivity partnerships, including distribution channels and price structures, with major telecommunication networks such as Vodafone, Verizon, and Orange. Because all of the infrastructure is already in place, manufacturers can get new products up and running in a matter of days. Platforms can also secure attractive wholesale rates from network partners that can then be passed on to manufacturers. 

In addition, an integrated service enablement platform will provide a range of valuable services including device management, customer support, and technical support. Operating within international telecommunications and payments systems frameworks, they can also help connected smart devices manage billing and payments subscriptions. By using one software platform, control panel, and set of integration tools, the process of launching a new product becomes far less complicated. 

**5G is the key** 

In the years ahead, technology is likely to take the world into uncharted territory. From self-driving cars to robotics, the applications of IoT are limitless. However, the key to success is seamless connectivity. That’s why the rollout of 5G technology – which offers super fast speeds and reliable connections – is such a big deal.

Ever hidden a workplace marriage as a joke in a research institute or university?,"I read a story about a married couple who joined the same company with a gap of 6 months, (they were married long before that) and the woman had kept her maiden name. Their co-workers knew about their married status but not that they were each other's spouses. Seeing their camaraderie, their co-workers tried to discourage them, admonishing against an extramarital affair, after which they revealed the truth.
Has anyone done this in a research/science/university setting? And is this even possible?

Epson 1200s on MS Vista,"It's been so long I forgot. This was once common knowledge.

But how does one install the Epson 1200s on MS Vista?

Computer transfer error

File Group: \_RWProfiles

File: &lt;szICCPath&gt;\\

Error: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrrect

WhatsApp rolled out its new update which includes some additional features. In the 2.19.110 version of WhatsApp for iPhone, it will no longer show a notification badge for muted chats.

Netflix for Content creators (For everyone),"I’m sure this topic came up and people hammered it into some sort of shape or another. I just couldn’t find it searching, so here’s my ‘What if question’

What if Netflix allowed content submissions similar to YouTube, Vimeo etc, but funnel (perhaps filtered) through expert editing/judges and ultimately to a Web 2.0 style upvote/downvote stage into their categories.  I think of these as I browse through YouTube and others and every once in a while run into contents that I wouldn’t mind paying for.  I just can never land into those by choice but rather by chance. I like the ‘Choice’. I think it would be Win - Win for the creators and the provider.  ( it may kill Udemy, hurt YouTube, etc)

Question about Huawei and USA relationship (August 26),"Hello

One of the cellphone companies of my country (México) is selling me a brand new P30 and a Y9 for 500. I plan to go for it and give the Y9 to my mother. The thing is, some months ago it was all over the internet that Huawei phones would't receive any more updates and that they would eventually stop using android. That scares me a bit, as I am planning to go for the previously mentioned deal. I have a samsung galaxy note 3 with lineage installed and my mother an iphone 6, so we kinda need an update. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I Took an Online Survey Earlier Today--,"And the first thing it did was show me this:

GID=106126&amp;__sres=273%7c156 
(I copied and pasted this string so I wouldn't forget it, and I have no idea what it means.)

It then proceeded to ask me a series of questions along the lines of:

""What are you testing for?""

""What is the terminator value, if any?"" 

(I don't remember the exact wording, but this is roughly the question it asked)

""What function did you just complete?"" (Again, this roughly what was asked)

And then it said something along the lines of:

""Congratulations, you terminated!""

Only to be followed by,

""We're sorry, but you will not be redirected.""

Can someone please explain what this string is, and what exactly I was being asked? I have a tiny idea of what was happening, but I was still deeply confused about the questions and why they were part of a random online survey?",technology,1561777215,Loakins217,4,0,True,2019-06-28 23:00:15

Screen recorded video on iOS—YouTube full screen?,"          Hey Guys I’ve  been wanting to start a fantasy football channel for a while now, but don’t have the resources for a computer so I’ve been trying to use my phone. I’ve legitimately spent 20+ hours trying to find different screen recording apps and editors that would be able to make a video become full screen on an iPhone on a screen recorder. Is there any way you know of that can take a video that is screen recorded, then can be sent to google drive or an editor or wherever and then be full screen on YouTube. I can do it now, but it’s only half screened with black bars on either side. I’m just at a loss fellas and need some help, cheers.",technology,1559170726,1thougtfulFolk,2,0,True,2019-05-29 18:58:46

Help! I don’t know what kind of laptop to get!,"
Hey redditors! So I just started my first semester of college and what do you know, my laptop is fried, i don’t want to go through all of the stress of trying to fix it (because it is beyond repair), id rather just double down and get a QUALITY piece of equipment. 

I’m looking for a WINDOWS laptop, i don’t know anything about RAM or anything like that, but i have a budget of about $600-$800. I want something that’s fast, has a lot of memory, and can support games like world of warcraft with excellent video quality and speed. this is the first time in my life that i’ve actually saved my own hard earned money for something, so i really want to get something that’s of quality, and i don’t want to drop 8 big ones on just ANY laptop. anyways, also a plus if it comes with microsoft word, movie maker, powerpoint etc. included but that’s not the end of the world if you can’t find something with a package deal. 

Pretty much i’d just be using this laptop for school assignments/research, gaming (pretty much just WoW), maybe a little streaming, surfing the web and also sometimes editing videos, and to be honest i prefer to use movie maker because it’s so easy to use. keep in mind i’d rather not have an older laptop, something that’s a newer model and has great reviews, something durable and quality, like a mac. but then again i don’t know jack shit about computers so maybe a mac is garbage to you computer guys. i was almost going to get a mac but i’m a diehard windows guy and couldn’t bring myself to learn a whole new system. 

i hope i provided enough information, any suggestions will be AMAZING!!

"If you turn night shift on, then the protanopia filter (red/green) is indistinguishable from no filter at all, on Apple devices.","There are three color sensitive pigments in the eye. The pigments are sensitive to red, green and blue colored light, and all the colors that we see are a result of these pigments being stimulated in some specific proportion. Some color blind people, called dichromats, have only two of these pigments. Any color that they see can be formed by using only two pigments.

You must have seen the demonstration where mixing red, green and blue light in various proportions forms most of the colors that you can see. Well, for dichromats, you only need two of those lights to make all the colors that they see.

So my hypothesis is that, since blue light is at the higher end of the visual spectrum, night shift just ditches the blue part of RGB and treats you like a dichromat with Protanopia.",technology,1572072377,the_flying_blo,0,1,True,2019-10-26 02:46:17

Ransomware can be remotely installed on Canon cameras. Now is a good time to update your firmware.,"Security researchers have discovered a way to remotely exploit Canon cameras (nearly all models including EOS series and mirrorless).

The exploit can run over USB (if your PC is infected with malware it can infect the camera) and over WiFi (an attacker would have to be in close physical proximity and the camera would have to connect to their rogue access point).

Here is a video put out by Checkpoint Security Research which shows them installing Ransomware on your camera (aka encrypting the images on the SD card and locking you out)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75fVog7MKgg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75fVog7MKgg)

and their report on how the exploit works : 

[https://research.checkpoint.com/say-cheese-ransomware-ing-a-dslr-camera/](https://research.checkpoint.com/say-cheese-ransomware-ing-a-dslr-camera/)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the official statement from Canon which explains how to address the issue.

[https://asia.canon/en/support/security-advisory-ptp-communication-and-firmware-functions/notice](https://asia.canon/en/support/security-advisory-ptp-communication-and-firmware-functions/notice)

TL:DR

\*\*Install the new firmware\*\* or if you cannot immediately , at least do this :

* Ensure the suitability of security-related settings of the devices connected to the camera, such as the PC, mobile device, and router being used.
* Do not connect the camera to a PC or mobile device that is being used in an unsecure network, such as in a free Wi-Fi environment.
* Do not connect the camera to a PC or mobile device that is potentially exposed to virus infections.
* Disable the camera’s network functions when they are not being used.
* Download the official firmware from Canon’s website when performing a camera firmware update.

Note that this exploit has not been seen in the wild yet, meaning it has not been used so far as far as anyone is aware. But still a good idea to ""patch"" your camera by updating firmware.",technology,1565601128,ResonancePhotographr,7,21,True,2019-08-12 05:12:08

Perks of Automation,"Automation isn’t a trend or something that just came up to the world recently. It has started about 45 years ago because the world was and will always be in need for this concept as it’s a game changer; saving time, money to accelerate work.
 
People’s continuous increasing need to perform complex tasks led to today’s automation wave that we are witnessing.

**What are the advantages of using automation??
From a business point of view, it has a huge potential to 
1. Increase Productivity
  - ROBOTS DON’T SLEEP 🤖 
  - Expand virtual work quickly &amp; easily.
  - Get more done in less time.
  - Eliminate human error to improve customer       satisfaction.
  - Allow employees to offload tasks to robots so people can focus on more important/on hand tasks.
  - Doesn’t replace; but leverage existing IT systems. 

2. Reduce Cost
  - Reduce operations cost by nearly 30% and increase throughput.

3. Compliance 
  - All steps are recorded for historical audits.

4. Analysis &amp; Data gathered.

And more important — Using automation in the right place will FOCUS ON ROI 

So what do you guys think about and can be added? 
And if you ever used automation in your business what are the tangible advantages that you see?",technology,1569585093,ghadahaniisamra,1,1,True,2019-09-27 07:51:33

Can I connect a microphone and a web cam to a Thunderbolt adapter and use it without latency issues?,"Just like the title says.

My laptop (Razer Blade 15) is basically out of ports to use as my mouse and keyboard take's up 2/3 of the ports, so I was looking to get a USB hub. But I read that USB hub's can cause latency issues (I plan on recording and streaming, hence my worry with latency).)

mClassic,"I know I’m a walking ad but this product is really gonna be amazing. The mClassic has as of today finally started shipping and there is still 6 days left on their extended “early backer” offer — which saves you $20 off of the retail price of $99. This thing is a powerful video card inside of a tiny HDMI adapter plug. It upscales every pixel redrawing them in a higher resolution with no lag —  using antialiasing, depth of field filtering, and image sharpening to create noticeable improvements in any HDMI video signal.. 1080p can be upscaled to 4K-comparable. And somehow just as amazing if not more is that 720p content can be boosted to 1080p and the reason that is so amazing is because you can force-lower your device’s resolution to 720p (maybe if your PC is choppy at 1080p or if your internet connecting makes fuzzy 1080p video during lag spikes) and the mClassic boosts it back to 1080p I’ll say again WITH NO LAG.

Please use my referral link and become a backer of this worthy innovation. A milestone in technology. Great for video or video games both modern or retro!

Comment rejected over on The Register,"[Second time lucky: Sweden drops Julian Assange rape investigation](https://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/all/2019/11/19/julian_assange_sweden_rape_investigation_dropped/):  

&gt; the balance of evidence suggests that Assange did indeed rape the girls ..

Assange was never charge with rape. The complainants originally contacted the police in relation to requiring Assange to take an STD test. The police response was to investigate Assange in relation to charges of ""sexual misconduct."" The investigation was closed and Assange was informed he was free to leave. Under the instructions of a politician and after Assange had left Sweden the investigation was re-opened and a European Arrest Warrant and an Interpol Red Notice was issued.

The alleged ""sexual misconduct"" consisted of consensual sex at which a condom allegedly malfunctioned. It didn't occur to the victim that such ""sexual misconduct"" occurred until an exchange of emails with another sexual partner of Assange. Indeed the victim attended a social event in the days after the sexual encounter.

Story: Your information is not safe from phone thieves. Put a PIN code on your SIM and disable 2FA using SMS!,"TLDR: thieves stole 2 phones from me and my sister and managed to reset passwords using my SIM card. To avoid this, enable and change the PIN on your SIM or don't use 2FA by SMS to protect your information if your phone is stolen!

Last year my phone was stolen, but the thiefs didn't know my screen passcode. I thought my information was secure and I called my carrier to cancel my line. But, in the meantime they managed to reset my Facebook password and got access to a lot of my information.

2 days ago, my sister's phone got stolen, but they didn't get her password aswell and she also called her carrier to cancel her line. But this guys are fast and they managed to reset her Google password and access all her stored password, including her bank account. They even managed to transfer money from her account!

My point is, when they get your phone, first thing they will do is put your SIM card on another phone, find your e-mail somehow and try to reset your account from Google, Facebook, Amazon, PayPal or any other that allows two factor authentication by SMS!

So, you should ENABLE the PIN code on your SIM and change it! This way, it will make almost impossible for them to use you SIM on another phone, because it will ask for this number, so they won't be able to reset your password. Usually every carrier has a default PIN, but is by default OFF, so you have to find out yours, enable and change it. But be careful, because if you write your PIN wrong three times it will lock your SIM and you will need the PUK code (unique for every one) or call your carrier to help you.

Example of default PIN for companies:

AT&amp;T: 1111
Verizon: 1111
Rogers: 1234


Another option is to not use two factor authentication by SMS and start using apps like Google Authenticator. Also, if you have an eSim probably this is not a problem to you.

Here is a website explaining how to enable and change you SIM's PIN:

"iPhone vs Android: For the die-hard iPhone users who claim its far better than Android devices: Honestly, have you ever tried using an Android device for a reasonable amount of time (at least 3 weeks) wherein “not being use to it” isn’t a factor anymore?","If you’ve never tried an Android device or tried it very briefly, what makes you say Android devices suck?

There were many times I heard iPhone users conveying its superiority over Androids and that Androids suck. But when asked why and if they’ve ever used an Android, 9 out of 10 times the answer would be “no” or “used one for a few days”.

It’s one thing to have used both for a fair amount of time and still prefer the iPhone, but people who dismiss something as inferior to the other and say it sucks without even having enough experience with it for an educated evaluation are stupid and delusional.

And just looking at the specifications, comparing an Android and iOS device in the same price range, the specs of the Android device are equal or surpass the iOS device.

So without actually using one, there really is no valid excuse to say it sucks or it’s inferior to the iPhone.

"Dear tech bloggers, tutorialists, and minions of Medium: If you wrote it when you were green, and it’s crap, please delete it.","MY REQUEST:
To any members of the tech community who may have authored a tutorial or blog in their early days that is still kicking around on the internet today, I make the following requests:
* Go back and review your work.
* Delete anything that you now know to be wrong.  
* Delete anything that is explained much better on other publicly accessible websites.
* Revise or delete anything you wrote that now strikes you as confusing.
* If something you wrote now feels less-than-perfect but has a lot of foot traffic, consider the possibility that the article was just easy to find before giving it the benefit of the doubt.
* Do not overlook stuff you wrote about old technologies that are still relevant. People still need to find good articles about CSS.
* Articles that present as general solutions things that only work in very narrow circumstances do more harm than good (e.g., the typical Webpack tutorial).  Either make the reader aware of the scope of applicability of your article, or delete it entirely.

BACK STORY:
Many coding bootcamps encourage their students to blog as a way of establishing a professional web presence.  It helps the student get their first job, which allows the bootcamp to advertise better job placement stats.  Some of this stuff is good, but much of it is wrong or too confusing to learn from. And a lot of it is ignorant about the hyper-contextual nature of certain technologies, resulting in scores of articles that present as a general solution something that only works under very narrow circumstances.  How many of you have wasted an hour of your life on a seemingly informative Webpack tutorial?  How about a tutorial for deploying a full stack app on Heroku?

The real problem with this phenomenon is dilution. Sources of genuinely informative material are harder to stumble across, and those few writers capable of explaining difficult subject matter in a comprehensible way are being drowned in an ocean crap. I studied React for months before Dan Abramov, Robin Wieruch, David Ceddia became household names. While that first name is obvious, I had to wade through a lot of garbage before recognizing the other two as sources of consistently informative material.",technology,1565234528,dsfhhslkj,0,1,True,2019-08-07 23:22:08

I personally believe as of right now both divergence and convergence is possible. Both have pros and cons, but the way they drag on about how it's such a terrible idea, it's kinda of making me question their reliability in giving advice.

No WiFi or mobile networks! Sony creates chip that allows incredible distance communication,"Sony is doing poorly in the smartphone market , but it may still launch a folding product next year. Meanwhile, it continues betting on networks to ensure a certain competitiveness in this market, and Japan is with a project that can revolutionize the internet industry of things.

The ELTREAS Sony network will soon air. Thanks to the CXM1501GR chip, manufacturers of IoT devices will be able to implement a device capable of communicating with the Japanese low latency network that can reach 100km. That would be revolutionary because today these products work very limited thanks to the low reach of wi-fis, or they come at extremely salty prices by the use of mobile networks that charge high fees.

The power of the manufacturer's network could be explained by exclusive technologies and permission to use the 920Hz band in Japan. The company believes that ELTREAS will revolutionize this market and help in the implementation of smart cities, since its applications go through modern services such as rental of bicycles, public light bulbs, external defibrillator automation, 24-hour surveillance systems, bus and train operation, drone location and more.

For the CXM1501GR to account for all this work he brings other various chips with him, including one for high accuracy GPS.

The path chosen by Sony is interesting and can accelerate the implementation of smart cities, something the 5G wants to do as well. Despite its most advanced discussion on the international scene, Brazil is starting to take its first steps in its implementation , with the definition of the first bands to be used for the fifth generation of mobile networks.

And you, do you think Sony will be successful in its new venture? Tell us in the comments!",technology,1559120958,androidandhealth,12,2,True,2019-05-29 05:09:18

Dear United States government...,"Please understand, encryption is math. Unlike everything else that makes you sad, you can't bully math. You can't threaten it, you can't sanction it. You either accept 1+1=2 or you make your own numbers and remove any bit of use case math has. These encryption tools protect EVERYONE. If governments would like to keep secrets from the pubic, they need true encryption. If you start allowing any type of backdoor workaround for government use it is without a doubt someone outside of the government will find their way in. In theory, this idea is the same as: I'm buying a super secure door for my house. The only one with the key is me..... And the company that made the door. The door is no longer secure.... That key could be copied by anyone at the company and distributed by 10s, 100s, or 1000s. They only way you can be sure that is not happening is to be the only holder of this key. If you want to force backdoors into apple products so that law enforcement may break encryption please know that the same attack will be used against government officials to give information they hide to citizens or enemies of the state.

With 10% unemployment and real state foreclosures reaching records highs money for the average person was hard to come by and the future of this country looked about as clear as the outcome of this trade war.

Out of all the chaotic uncertainty the one thing that did seemed to be certain in the late 2000’s and early 2010’s was that the People’s Republic of China was modernizing at warp speed and was just a matter of time until it’s economy would surpass the US. With some financial advisors like Forbes’ **Mike Patton** predicting that China’s contribution to the global GDP would surpass the US by 2018.

Well, here we are in 2019 and China’s official GDP accounted for about 16% of the global GDP while the US still accounts for about 25% of total GDP output. With people continuing to question the legitimacy of the economic data released by Beijing due to their closed system and lack of transparency. That prediction wasn’t as crystal clear as much of us though and it isn’t actually a bad thing.

**POWER PARITY:**

With an economic Trade War looming over everyone’s head for almost 2 years now, news of a possible phase one deal announced on October 11th by the Trump Administration, verified by Beijing’s **Liu He** October 21st, came as much of a surprise to me as it did for anyone who’d being following the events of the trade war as closely as I have since the very beginning.

That is because this “Phase one” announcement had come just 4 days after Washington had added 28 Chinese companies to a US blacklist blocking those companies from buying American products. And it came 2 weeks after news reports were released on September 27th that Washington was considering possibly de-listing Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. Keyword “possibly”.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/us-to-blacklist-28-chinese-entities-over-abuses-in-xinjiang.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/us-to-blacklist-28-chinese-entities-over-abuses-in-xinjiang.html) 

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-listings-explainer/explainer-what-delisting-chinese-firms-from-u-s-stock-markets-could-mean-idUSKBN1WF17S](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-listings-explainer/explainer-what-delisting-chinese-firms-from-u-s-stock-markets-could-mean-idUSKBN1WF17S) 

Before the phase one trade deal was announced CNBC’s **Jim Crame**r jokingly said that the trump administration was *“torpedoing trade talks”* by blacklisting 28 Chinese companies days before trade talks were scheduled to begin.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/08/cramer-trump-torpedoing-trade-talks-by-blacklisting-china-tech.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/08/cramer-trump-torpedoing-trade-talks-by-blacklisting-china-tech.html) 

The companies blacklisted were in addition to the more than 140 Chinese companies already in the US trade blacklist. More prominently in this blacklist is Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, “China‘s national champion“. Which was put on the US blacklist in May 2019 citing “national security reasons”. Shortly after that in May 31, following a policy of tit-for-tat, Beijing announced that the Chinese government would be introducing an *“****unreliable foreign entity list*** *of companies or individuals that boycott or cut off supplies to Chinese companies for non-commercial purposes and causing serious damages to Chinese companies”.*

Practically forgotten now, so serious and credible was this “unreliable entity list” announcement taken at the time that all mayor news networks reported on it for weeks following.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/china-is-establishing-an-unreliable-entities-list-that-will-include-companies-and-people.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/china-is-establishing-an-unreliable-entities-list-that-will-include-companies-and-people.html) 

Trade negotiations would practically enter hiatus for the next few months after that. With Huawei, now uncertain about it’s access to US technology and services such as Google apps, declaring  virtual *“technological independence from the US“* in the meantime.

The day phase one deal was announced by Washington, I immediately remembered the Forbes article below from September by Panos Mourdoukoutas, arguing that *“economic interdependence between The US and China had given elites in Beijing the false impression that they had reached power parity with the US“.*

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/09/07/a-big-mistake-chinas-political-elite-makes-in-fighting-the-trade-war/#74df275352e6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/09/07/a-big-mistake-chinas-political-elite-makes-in-fighting-the-trade-war/#74df275352e6) 

After searching the article again and reading it a second time, it read to me as foretelling a month before what would occur in October. And that indeed, at least not yet, China hasn’t reached power parity with the US.

Because one would think that following the US blacklisting another 28 Chinese companies and possibly even delisting some more from stock exchanges would have being the perfect time for Beijing to release this “**unreliable foreign entity list**” demonstrating to the world it’s tit-for-tat power parity. Not the time to be making concessions to the US like committing to purchase agriculture products nor asking to discuss Huawei’s access to US made tech and services. In exchange for what concessions from Washington?

Delaying tariffs set to go into effect on October 15th while keeping in place tariffs set for December 15th?

That didn’t seem like much of a concession from the US side to me.

Was the US telling China *“we’ll stop the pain, let‘s make a deal”* or was Beijing asking the US to *“stop the pain let‘s make a deal“*? Because pain was apparent and this was the moment that Beijing’s pain threshold seemed severely less-tolerant than Washington’s pain threshold. And the moment Washington’s arsenal to inflict that economic pain began looking a lot bigger and a lot more diverse than what Beijing could retaliate with without inflicting even greater damage to it’s economy than what Washington was already doing and could possible do with it‘s now dangerous looking arsenal. Like releasing that serious sounding unreliable foreign entity list that could possible cripple foreign investment in China even further. It seemed like the beginning of the end of the trade war to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRADE WAR A GOOD THING:**

The ongoing trade war between the US and China seems like a good thing for the US and an even better thing for China.

After experiencing an unprecedented and virtually unopposed modernization and economic prosperity for 20-30 years because of various circumstances and policies from different countries and organizations around the world favoring Beijing, it seems China became “**over-confident**” about it’s rise being “**a promised destiny to be fulfilled in just a matter of time**“. A confidence not missed by Chinese government’s propaganda to the outside world. That’s the problem when you begin to believe your own hype and exaggerations.

China seems to have also underestimated America’s response and tolerance to new peer-competitor. Not imagining living in a world where China could not have access to US capital markets and access to US dollars being limited. Still by far the most important world currency. In other words China had gotten “cocky“.

***“This is a refreshing healthy dose of reality check for Chinese leaders in Beijing.”*** Nothing is promised. Nothing is destined. China’s rise was facilitated and China was smart and competent enough the make the best of an already good thing.

But now that the US has determined China to be at best a “peer-competitor” at worst “an enemy” and China’s access to crucial US technology deeply in question, it will be time for China to stand in it’s own two feet, not simply appear be a great responsible rising power but to become one. A lot more light is shinning on China nowadays, between Honk Kong, Uighur Muslim re-education camps, it’s economy and most importantly it’s technological independence being part of everyday news now.

Will the world continue to turn a blind eye to China’s human rights abuses in order to appease the new top dog in Charge of world economic affairs? Or will China have to make serious substantial, verified changes to it’s internal politics?

Will China’s national champions be able to compete toe-to-toe with foreign companies without subsidizing them in a “truly open Chinese market”? Not just in a market that appears open.

IP theft, forced tech transfers and trade secrets have become recognizable language to most average people. It doesn’t leave much room for China to acquire technology without indigenous innovation.

Now will be time to show the word China can innovate independently and compete in a level playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE US:**

Never having a peer-competitor race so close so fast in it’s history a new peer-competitor is another “fresh dose of reality check” to the US to up it’s game. With the myth of China’s destined invincibility now shattered, most Americans see a second chance to retain it’s status in the world. Just as China, no-one promised the US would remain the world’s dominant super-power indefinitely.

*“The US does not tolerate peer-competitors, look at what happened to Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. What does that tell you?”* argues **Michael Marshier** a renounced political realists.

[https://youtu.be/oRlt1vbnXhQ](https://youtu.be/oRlt1vbnXhQ)

Famous historian **Niall Ferguson** states *“We’ve entered a new tech war (that) will be an arms race for everything, from Artificial Intelligence to Quantum computing more than Nuclear weapons and rockets to the moon.” The next 10 years will be very different than the last 10 years”* (for humanity).

[https://youtu.be/EYPCcwnueB8](https://youtu.be/EYPCcwnueB8) 

Indeed the US has already recognized the urgent need to up it’s game and begin to compete with China in fields China has already gotten a head start. In December 2018 “**The National Quantum Initiative Act**” was signed in to law. A plan allocating over 1.2 billion USD over 5 years in R &amp; D for advancing Quantum technology. Just one of multiple initiatives by the US to continue to excell globally.

[https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/national-quantum-initiative-signed-law](https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/national-quantum-initiative-signed-law) 

&amp;#x200B;

**FOR HUMANITY:**

Indeed innovation is sparked from competition, the last cold war sparked an unprecedented level of creativity that placed humanity into space for the first time in our history. Breaking new ground in unexplored territories. This new tech war promises to take us beyond that. That is as long as the new arms race doesn’t get out of control, like the new Hypersonic Weapons already developed by Russia and China just now being developed by the US military.

In some other aspects the new tech war is much less threatening. Such as the recent news that Space X offered their new Spaceship Rocket to the US military to transport equipment and personal overseas.

[https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a29539494/space-x-us-army-starship/](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a29539494/space-x-us-army-starship/) 

Fully autonomous vehicles driving you to and from work, sanctioned artificial intelligent new life forms assisting you at a convenience stores, space tourism with travel itineraries to Mars all becoming realities in the next 10 years no longer seems so far fetched. And we may all have Washington and Beijing’s new rivalry to thank for it. As long as cool heads prevail on both sides as much as in the last cold war.

How to Help Censored Users Access the Tor Network by Just Installing a Browser Addon!,"Thanks to a new Pluggable Transport called Snowflake you can now help censored users access the Tor network by just installing an addon. The way it works is pretty simple: censored users learn about a temporary proxy (a 'snowflake') from a broker (using domain fronting or other techniques) that they establish a connection with using WebRTC, the temporary proxy then transmits the requests to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network, the temporary proxy thus functions as a middle point between the censored user and the bridge &lt;=&gt; Tor network. The idea is that by getting a significantly large of ever changing and decaying temporary proxies it will be hard for a single censor to keep track and block all of them. As [David Fifield](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/thesis/#chap:snowflake) eloquently explains,

&gt; Snowflake derives its blocking resistance from having a large number of proxies. A client may use a particular proxy for only seconds or minutes before switching to another. If the censor manages to block the IP address of one proxy, there is little harm, because many other temporary proxies are ready to take its place. 

As explained earlier, when you function as a snowflake proxy **no exit traffic is generated at your level, you just transit traffic to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network. Hence there is no need to worry about which websites the clients are accessing through your proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours.** In addition Snowflake's strength comes from having a large pool of temporary proxies, so don't forget to spread the word and have a maximum of people installing this addon!

The addon is available for Firefox on AMO:

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/torproject-snowflake/

* (and for Android) https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/torproject-snowflake/

And if you happen to want to install it on a Chromium based browser it is available as well on the Chrome Addon Store:

* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie

A couple of notes:

* You need WebRTC to be enabled in your browser for this to work, this is simply owing to how Snowflake works. The extension will display a warning if it detects that WebRTC isn't enabled.

* The addon tells you when a client is connecting using your proxy and how many clients you have helped circumvent censorship in the last 24h. However, right now Snowflake is only available for the **alpha** releases of the Tor Browser and then only for Linux and Mac OS, as such [there aren't currently many Snowflake users](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-transport.html?transport=snowflake), so it shouldn't be surprising for you to pass an entire 24h without having any reported client connection.

* There are other ways to run a Snowflake proxy that are outlined [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake#HowtorunaSnowflakeproxy).

Apple’s Patent For Wraparound Display Hints Possibility For New IPhone,"Apple, an American multinational technology company, has revived its interest in an old patent that details a mysterious wraparound display. In March 2013, Apple had filed a [**Patent Application**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/patent) that features an ambiguous device having a glass body and a display looping around the body. Since then, the company has filed thirteen patent applications revolving around the design of this device. The recent patent that details some changes in the design of the device is a continuation of the previous ones.

As far as display and body are concerned, Apple has always had a glass display and a metal body. Undoubtedly, some plastic derivatives at the middle and lower-end were also used for the rear panel, and there have been smartphones’ models with the display on, but a complete wrap-around is something no one has seen so far. Although the concept of wraparound display technology has been available with Samsung and Xiaomi also, no commercial model with such design is accessible in the market.

The changes in the latest patent showcase virtual volume keys, rather than the traditional physical buttons. They also show that the device includes a top bezel that further consists of an earpiece and many other essential sensors in addition to a narrow bottom bezel. The device doesn’t hold the notch, which most of the recent iPhones do.

The wraparound display described in the patent application indicates that the expected device will be an all-glass affair having the display on both sides of the phone. It even suggests that this could be Apple’s answer to a foldable phone. That may appear a little far-fetched as a foldable smartphone when unfolded converts it into a tablet.

Nonetheless, it is noticeable that the sketches in the patent application detail the original 2013’s design so that the company can update it for a future release to keep up with the prevailing design trends. However, with Apple too, it is highly unlikely that the firm will unveil an iPhone with a wraparound display or the iPhone 12 (to be launched next fall) will have this updated design.

We should consider that this is just a patent, which may exist as it is for several years. It is also possible that Apple may never come up with this device as the company files multiple patent applications each month, and it’s a continuous process. Indeed, various concepts and designs for which it gets the patents don’t see the light of the day.  **For more visit:** [**https://www.trademarkmaldives.com**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/)

How to promote your Instagram: 13 ways that actually work,"It’s time to rethink how to promote your Instagram account.

Why now? Because the platform’s rapid evolution and growth mean that what worked in the past isn’t going to score you the same sort of engagement today.

Based on recent Instagram stats, the visual space is becoming more and more crowded with brands fighting tooth and nail for more customers.

As a result, it quite literally pays to have as many tactics as possible to promote Instagram to your target audience.

In this guide, we’ve broken down 13 totally actionable ways to do exactly that. From optimizing your posts and profile to rethinking your approach to content promotion, any combination of these tips are fair game when it comes to Instagram promotion.

1. Ramp up your content production

There’s no shortage of [Instagram content](https://marketingunitech.com) you can publish to fill up your feed.

Customer photos. Memes. Bite-sized videos.

And that doesn’t even scratch the surface of what’s available to you.

To figure out what performs the best among your audience, you’re going to need to experiment. That means ramping up your content production and posting more frequently.

Publishing to Instagram at least once a day is within the platform’s best practices. Heck, major brands like TopShop and H&amp;M post up to three times per day (if not more often).

As you roll out more content, it’s crucial to squeeze more engagement out of your following by understanding the best times to post on Instagram.

The best times to post on Instagram according to Sprout Social

Publishing a photo every once in a while isn’t going to cut it if you want to stay fresh in your followers’ feeds.

And speaking of which, that’s also why [Instagram Stories](https://marketingunitech.com) are so valuable. Off-the-cuff content via Stories essentially allows you to “skip the line” and appear front-and-center in people’s feeds. Not only that, but you can freely post snap after snap without worrying about spamming your fans.

The takeaway here is that Instagram moves much quicker than it did a year or two ago in terms of content. Brands should ramp up if they want to keep up.

2. Cross-promote your Instagram posts across other networks

The effort it takes to snag the perfect snapshot and craft a clever caption isn’t something that should go to waste.

Cross-posting your content to other social platforms is a no-brainer to get even more of an ROI out of your Instagram presence.

For example, you can promote your Instagram content across the likes of Facebook and Twitter to maximize your content’s reach.

Although cross-promotion is a smart move, bear in mind that each social platform has its own best practices. For example, Instagram tends to go heavier on the hashtags while you might want to craft a slightly different description for images posted to Facebook.

Sound time-consuming? It doesn’t have to be.

Sprout Social’s Asset Library enables you to store images, videos and text in a centralized location for use across multiple social networks. Quickly find, edit and publish directly from the Asset Library to deliver engaging posts that are tailored to whatever network you’re using.

Having an asset library handy allows you to upload all of your social creatives in one place

And don’t forget to make your job even easier by using scheduling and publishing tools.

Features such as Sprout's Viralpost ensure that your promote Instagram content at the right times for engagement

Sprout’s Optimal Send Times simplifies things further by scheduling content to post at the times most likely to generate engagement from your audience.

3. Focus on people-centric content

Although Instagram is a place to score sales, it is still first and foremost a place to share experiences.

The popularity of selfies on Instagram speaks for itself, as does customer photos and pictures of people using products in real-world settings. Much of the appeal of Instagram is that brands are capable of advertising in a more human way without bombarding followers with messages that scream “BUY NOW!”

And on a related note, this is exactly why user-generated content such as customer photos are such a goldmine for brands. Not only do folks on the ‘gram love it when brands shout them out, but customer photos represent marketing firepower that proves that people dig your products.

But in order to spot and curate user-generated content for your feed, you’re going to need to understand how hashtags can help you promote your Instagram.

And that leads us to our next point.

4. Experiment with branded and industry hashtags

Brands both big and small should create a hashtag to encourage sharing and promotion on behalf of their followers. Doing so doesn’t have to be rocket science, either.

For example, Ernie Ball displays their #iplayslinky and #colorsofrocknroll hashtags loud and clear in their bio.

Including a branded hashtag in your bio is the first step to allowing followers to promote your Instagram

In turn, they use the tag to promote their own posts in addition to thousands of loyal fans promoting the brand organically.

Through[branded hashtag](https://marketingunitech.com), you can encourage followers to promote your Instagram for you

See how that works?

Beyond your own hashtags, you should try to promote your Instagram using more general, community hashtags specific to your industry such as #6strings (music) or #unicornhair (beauty). Tacking on extra tags essentially makes your posts searchable by tag-followers and instantly increases your reach.

As noted in our guide detailing how to use hashtags across every social network, engagement peaks at approximately nine hashtags. Although you can certainly use less (or more), the takeaway here is that you should at the very least add something.

Including hashtags on your Instagram content automatically increases engagement

Don’t forget to take advantage of hashtag analytics tools. Sprout lets you track and analyze hashtag performance to find out what’s resonating with audiences and optimize usage.

And with Sprout’s Advanced Listening, you can move beyond quantitative data to find qualitative insights related to hashtags, allowing you to fully understand campaign performance and measure share of voice. Additionally, you can identify related hashtags to dive deeper into the brand-relevant conversations consumers are having on social.

5. Tag brands, followers and locations whenever you can

Tagging is a surprisingly effective way to promote your Instagram.

And no, we’re not just talking about hashtags.

For example, you can tag other brands and accounts in hopes of a shout-out yourself. Given that notifications ping anyone who receives them, relevant tags are a subtle way to encourage promotion.

Likewise, it’s both courtesy and within Instagram’s best practices to tag anyone you might be regramming. Chances are they’ll be thrilled to be featured in your feed and will share the news with their own followers.

Don’t forget to tag locations, too! For example, if you have a physical location for your business or regularly attends events, location-specific posts allow you to explore new potential fans and followers.

Location tagging is essential to location [Instagram promotion](https://marketingunitech.com)

6. Publish Instagram content on-site

When it comes to ads, what better billboards than your own customers?

Featuring Instagram content on-site is a brilliant way to increase conversions. Why? Because when people see purchased products in real-world settings, they know that the brand in question has satisfied customers. Consumers can better visualize and understand a product for themselves when they see it “in the wild.”

Thus the rise of lookbooks and brands featuring user-generated content on product pages. For example, Casper uses an Instagram slideshow on-site to show off their satisfied sleepers.

Of course, this all circles back to the need to promote your Instagram hashtag.

In addition to their Instagram bio, #TopShopStyle is plastered across the brand’s site and marketing emails to increase their tag’s exposure. The end result is more user-generated content and people promoting TopShop organically.

Promoting your hashtag on-site goes hand in hand with [Instagram promotion](https://marketingunitech.com)

7.  Carve out your creative trademark

Creativity counts on Instagram.

Having some sort of niche or theme is a great way to both inspire your Instagram content and make yourself stand out from the crowd.

For example, Yeti is known for its feed full of high-res photos of the outdoors featuring adventures enjoying their products.

Yeti's creative trademark on Instagram is high-quality photos of landscapes

Meanwhile, oVertone boasts a bold color-coded feed based on whichever shade of their product their currently promoting.

oVertone's creative trademark on Instagram is their use of color

If you’re stumped as to what your creative trademark should be, don’t sweat it. There are tons of Instagram apps (such as VSCO) which can help you add some creative flair to your photos. By using consistent gradients, colors and filters, you can make your feed feel more, well, you.

8. Work with influencers to extend your reach

As we mentioned earlier, Instagram benefits from being a platform where brands can essentially publish ads without shoving them in their followers’ faces.

Enter the rise of influencer marketing.

Simply put, influencer marketing entails a paid relationship with another Instagram account with a sizeable, engaged follower count. Influencers’ audiences should ideally mirror your own or allow you to tap into a new sect of users that you’re trying to reach.

Influencers are akin to ads in the sense that the relationship does indeed cost money. However, finding the right influencer can be an incredibly cost-effective way to both sell products and grow your following.

Brands can spot influencers through hashtags and manual searching, or you can try Instagram analytics tools such as Tapinfluence or search an in-depth database related to your business.

Tapinfluence's directory makes it easy to hone in on potential influencers who could help promote your [Instagram presence](https://marketingunitech.com)

Remember: when identifying influencers, just make sure they have a following that actually engages with their content. Engagement rate calculators such as this one from Phlanx can help give you peace of mind about any influencers in question.

Engagement rate is a crucial metric when looking for an influencer to help promote your Instagram

9. Rethink how you present your products and promotions

This is a simple tip but is definitely something worth mentioning. And it relates to that other kind of Instagram promotion – the one with fun giveaways or sale items and can be incredibly valuable for your brand when done well.

So when you promote your Instagram in these instances, it’s crucial to present your content as must-see.

Instagram thrives on anything and everything “new.” Anything you can do to create a sense of hype is a major point in your favor.

For example, check out how Glossier hypes up their much-requested eye cream by surprising their followers a day before it drops.

Uniqlo publishes hype-heavy Instagram promotions and content, including calls-to-action for followers to check out their exclusive merch.

Pinup Girl also does a great job of highlighting why their products rock and allows their brand voice to shine through in the process.

As a rule of thumb, think “so what” before you hit “publish” for your promotions on Instagram. Doing so will ultimately encourage you to write more compelling captions.

10. Run a contest or giveaway

Here’s some food for thought: brands that run contests grow their followings 70% faster than those that don’t.

You might notice that many brands’ contest and giveaway-related posts receive insane amounts of engagement and that’s no accident. Done correctly, social media contests can result in followers and fans although they can also attract freebie-chasers. We recommend running a one-time contest promotion on Instagram to test the waters and determine whether or not contests are something you want to try for the long-term.

11. Optimize your profile for promotion

As you work through how to promote Instagram to new fans and followers, “looking the part” is essential.

This also applies to brands looking to attract more attention organically.

Let’s take a look at what makes an optimized Instagram profile. The good news is that there aren’t too many moving pieces of your profile itself to worry about.

Orlando’s East End Market is a prime example of a simple yet optimized profile. For starters, their username “eastendmkt” is short and sweet, all the while easy to find for locals searching for it.

A searchable username makes it much easier for potential followers to find you and promote your Instagram

Their bio also ticks the boxes of an optimized profile, including a clear profile picture, compelling bio, branding hashtag and trackable URL. Everything about this Instagram bio lets us know what to expect from their feed and likewise that we’re in the right place.

An optimized bio includes a hashtag, link and essential contact information

They also feature their email and phone number which is something to consider if you’re running a business account. East End also regularly tags other businesses and events to expand their profile’s reach. Oh, and not to mention their awesome visual content that their local followers love.

12. Take advantage of Instagram Stories and its latest features

Stories are by far Instagram’s most popular feature.

Used by over 500 million users daily, brands should take advantage of Stories as often as possible when promoting on Instagram. For many businesses, this means publishing user-generated photos and behind-the-scenes content. The beauty of Stories is that you don’t have to worry as much about your visuals being polished or “perfect.”

That said, creativity still counts when it comes to Stories. Among Instagram’s latest features, Stories are always at the center of them. For example, new interactive stickers such as the new Quiz sticker represent fresh ways that brands can engage with followers for a more unique and interactive type of Instagram promo.

Instagram is consistently rolling out new features for Stories including the new Quiz stiicker

Keeping up with Instagram means staying active and on top of its latest features. If you’re regularly publishing to Stories and watching what other brands are doing, you’ll always be in-the-know.

13. Consider running a paid campaign

Last but not least, don’t neglect the potential of paid promotion on Instagram.

After all, social media at large is becoming increasingly pay-to-play. As part of Facebook’s insanely in-depth ad platform, you can use Instagram’s eye-popping ad options to win over new customers.

There are plenty of Instagram success stories out there including this example from Dunkin which cleverly uses both Stories and video to grab the attention of users.

First familiarize yourself with today’s Instagram ad specs, then make sure you have the tools necessary to see how your paid efforts stack up against your organic Instagram presence.

Sprout’s paid tools for Instagram empower you to gain insight into the ROI of your overall strategy or compare the performance of individual campaigns to optimize appropriately. Easily highlight your top campaigns by video views, conversions, impressions, engagement and more.

So, how do you promote your Instagram?

When it comes to Instagram promotion, you have plenty of tactics to experiment with.

And hey, that’s a good thing.

Making sure that your feed stands out means understanding the platform’s best practices and evolving alongside Instagram itself. Sticking to the tips above can help you maximize your engagement as you promote your Instagram to new followers and customers.

Decentralized Government Corporation.,"Hello r/technology Sub-Reddit, my name is Alexander R. Gieraltowski. I am currently eighteen years old and live in Downtown Manhattan, New York City. I am also the Founder &amp; Chief Executive Officer of the Settlement Defense Federation, a Decentralized Government Corporation. I have been developing this company for the past three years, ranging from planning financial strategies to developing software needed. A few days ago I releases a very brief summary of what the Settlement Defense Federation is and plans to accomplish; 

""The Settlement Defense Federation is a Decentralized Government Corporation, a Sovereign State, Comprised of Multiple Subsidiaries Operating in Various Market Sectors. In Accordance with Maritime-Law &amp; with the Articles of the Law of the Sea, the Settlement Defense Federation Seeks to Operate a Sea-Based Micro State 12 nautical miles Off the Coast of Manhattan &amp; Long Island, New York, U.S. The Settlement Defense Federation Strives to Ensure the Continuing Stability &amp; Security of the United States Economy through the Implementation of Efficient &amp; Effective Economic Practices, Additionally Supported by the Research &amp; Development of Advanced Technological Systems with the Capability of Accelerating the Modernization of the United States as a Whole. Externally the Sea-Based Micro State of the Settlement Defense Federation will be Comprised of Multiple Floating Platforms I.e. Retired Aircraft Carriers Upgraded &amp; Outfitted to Support the Operations of the SDF State. Citizens of the SDF Micro State will Operate within its Personal Jurisdiction while Still Being Subject to Certain U.S. Laws.""

To me, that is the briefest summary I could write that respectively got my initial point across of describing what the Settlement Defense Federation is. So anyway, I have been developing this business for the past three years and I am now at the point in time where I am ready to start raising capital through public contributions... and well, It has not been going well. I have been trying to raise capital for the past 4 months and have literally raised nothing, not a single penny. I am getting to the point where working on this business is becoming painful, I put all this time and effort In and have not been able to convince anyone in the potential this business has, enough to the point that they would make a donation / contribution. Developing this business is all I do, roughly twelve hours per day. So yeah, thank you for reading this, if you have any ideas for me and/or questions, feel free to comment them below.

Thank you for your time,

Data transmission at note frequencies,"A couple of days ago I have reverse engineered a Russian voice assistant Alice, analogue Amazon Alexa. It was activated by a sequence of sounds, where for each hex symbol, its own frequency is selected. There are problems with reliability and safety, but, as I understand it, in this case the user experience was more important.

And I thought that the data transfer protocol is always a compromise between range, speed and reliability. But what if all these characteristics fade into the background, and the decisive factor is the impression factor for the user? I decided to make a protocol in which note frequencies will be used for modulation.

I selected 16 frequencies for each hexadecimal character starting from C1. Using higher notes will make your ears less comfortable. And lower notes are worse transmitted due to the characteristics of the speakers and microphones. It turned out a kind of musical-frequency modulation.

You can listen to how any phrases sound in a [small online demo](https://octave.skrup.ru/?lang=en&amp;message=Reddit).

Of course, it’s fun to listen to random sounds based on text, but data transmission can only be called if the signal is received. I made a prototype receiver as a proof of concept. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4oj1lZcFw) of how it works.

All current developments are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/krupnikas/octave) \- you can try to develop the project yourself.

Apple Is Locking iPhone Batteries to Discourage Repair.,"By activating a dormant software lock on their newest iPhones, Apple  is effectively announcing a drastic new policy: only Apple batteries can  go in iPhones, and only they can install them.

If you replace the battery in the newest iPhones, a message  indicating you need to service your battery appears in Settings &gt;  Battery, next to Battery Health. The “Service” message is normally an  indication that the [battery is degraded and needs to be replaced](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207453).  The message still shows up when you put in a brand new battery,  however. Here’s the bigger problem: our lab tests confirmed that even  when you swap in a genuine Apple battery, the phone will still display  the “Service” message.

It’s not a bug; it’s a feature Apple wants. Unless an Apple Genius or  an Apple Authorized Service Provider authenticates a battery to the  phone, that phone will never show its battery health and always report a  vague, ominous problem.

Company in Rio de Janeiro manages to lower health care price to 1/10th by leveraging technology,"One of the episodes of Amazon's ""web-serie"" called NowGoBuild ([https://aws.amazon.com/startups/NowGoBuild/](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/NowGoBuild/)) talks about the Healthcare system in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The video includes some of the challenges with providing global healthcare to a country of continental scale plagued with corruption, but more importantly, it shows how technology can help make it accessible to the poorest of the poor.  


This video tells the beautiful story of ""Dr Consulta"", a startup that is disrupting the HealthCare space by using the cloud to keep track of exam records, scale up and down and overall make the life of Brazilians much better.  


A few numbers that I found would be interesting to share (all from the video):

* 150MM out of 200MM Brazilians are ""Medically Homeless""
* Average waiting time to see a Doctor using the public healthcare system is 3 months  


When it comes to cost of exams etc, here's where it gets crazy:

Mammography \~ 172 BRL or  38 USD   
Retina Mapping \~ 160 BRL or 35 USD   
Glicemic Index analysis, Blood tests and Urine tests \~ 10 to 15 BRL or 2.2 to 3.3 USD  

Next time we look at health care in America, we need to think hard about these numbers.

My name is Nic Naccarato and I'm a US veteran being exploited by a very large US company(s)- need legal assistance.," 

Reddit- My name is Nic Naccarato. I’m 32 in Tacoma, Washington and I've never needed help so badly in my life.  I need a lawyer.

I’m  also the grandson of two Army veterans- one became a pro + semi  professional athlete before developing into one of Washington state’s  most successful fundraisers and promoters- Stan ‘Mr. Tacoma’ Naccarato.

My  other Grandfather, John Bardwil went Airborne to conquer his fear of  heights before using the GI Bill to become a neurosurgeon in the Houston  area of Texas.

I, too, spent a  stint in the US Armed Forces- enlisting into the Washington Army  National Guard as a Cavalry Scout before transferring to the 1-143rd  Infantry Regiment (Airborne), with whom he deployed to Paktika Province  of Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2011-2012.

Looking  back at my life-changing experience in the 143rd, I was seemingly  singled out by my peers and leadership..dealt swift punishment and  motivated with hazing/motivation beyond a reasonable comparison to my  platoon mates and battalion. Prior to deployment I was promoted to Team  Leader due to my aggression, and ended up being made to train versus my  entire platoon in OPFOR situations.

Overseas,  as a Corporal (E-4) I was given more responsibility than any E-6 in our  element, generally the go-to grunt on the ground for getting to the  high ground and  providing overwatch as a Surveillance / Observation  element of 2-4, while the rest of our 2 squad element would conduct  their movement on the ground.

I  woke up at 0500 to do the first of 2x a days (while running mission  daily in between) with my mentor and Platoon Leader 1LT Ranger Barton,  and racked out only after completing intel research to brief the convoy  the next day’s mission.

I ended up  in the top 8 on order of merit out of our entire battalion of many  Airborne and sometimes Ranger joes, for Airborne, Ranger, Sniper, and  was one of 3 in battalion nominated for R-SLC (Recon and Surveillance  Leadership course).

I had never  been prouder- hearing my name mentioned in speeches, being appreciated  as both point man for dismounted patrols, and overwatch for others, I  was confident I had never put in such a solid effort day after day for  over a year.

So when I went home  to Washington, and everyone else in my platoon went back to  Austin/Texas, I was shocked when my chain of command had no interest in  getting me to Texas.   The 143rd went on to become globally deplorable  worldwide in 72 hours as part of the 173rd Sky Soldiers and Ranger  Barton was promoted to Company Commander- how was it that these men so  easily turned their backs after I had dedicated my time, dedication, and  resources I couldn’t afford by flying from Washington to Texas?

It  was almost eerie. I was devastated, and over the course of the next year  I went from being at the best physical and mental condition of my life  to slowly straining and destroying every relationship I had until I was  isolated. I was drinking absurd amounts with often toxic doses of pills.

5  more years of slowly deteriorating, substance abuse, until I was  completely out of my mind when I entered inpatient treatment at the VA  at the end of 2018.

Along the way,  in 2017 I was contacted on LinkedIn by a City official, **David Johnson  the steward of development** for the **City of Tacoma** who ended up being the  #1 man in the real estate department for a city that was booming with  waterfront and premium developments on some of the most affordable land  in the country..

City Official and  I had come to ‘spontaneously’ creatively collaborate on a concept that  was unidentified and constantly evolving. He and I signed a  “Stewardship” agreement (I have it somewhere) where he agreed to represent my project for a  period of time, and I reciprocated by giving him access to my 400+  passwords in Google Chrome, and other conditions that do not make sense  in the frame of this limited agreement.

Then,  additionally on LinkedIn, I was contacted by a charismatic vet who said  he was a transitioning Army veteran looking for work named **Justin Peterson**. We were born on  the same day, (Mother’s Day - May 10) enlisted on the same day, and  instantly had a brotherly connection. Quickly things developed, and I flew him to Tacoma with the intention of trying to  raise money on the spot to be able to afford hiring him at my ‘new  company’ I was planning on being able to form with the support of City  Official and his contacts.

As it turned out, we failed to reach our fundraising goal and Army veteran ended up working for a company called [Victory Media.](https://www.viqtory.com/)  (I would find out-- he had already been hired by them.

We  kept in touch, and he kept me in the loop about some developments-  Victory Media was AKA Military Friendly (owns the trademark) and has  clients that are among the largest corporations in the world. He quickly  becomes introduced to the ‘who’s who’ of the corporate business world-  Salesforce, Google, tech companies, seemingly some Republican senators  including the late John McCain, Mark Rockefeller and Street Shares  (introduced me to MR on LinkedIn), and eventually Red Cell Talent- who  he said under his breath was Verizon and IBM among other tech companies.

Eventually  Victory Media veteran asks me to ‘set up a meeting’ between Red Cell  Talent and the University of Washington - Tacoma. I arrange a video  conference, with Pierce County Economic Developers trying to tag along  as well as UW T’s technology department- for whatever reason the  meeting ends up being only ‘[Daniel Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmnichols/)’ and myself. Daniel says he  is basically ‘higher than CFO at Verizon’ and inquired about details of  my project for maybe 20 mins after sending an unsigned NDA (I have it, and the emails exchanged) to me and  again failing to return It. He made some very cryptic comments about a  ‘$400 million dollar project’, also saying, last thing he said to me  after saying we would talk again next week- ‘You’re it.’ With a  completely somber face, the video feed disconnects and I never hear from  him again.

At this point, my  friend’s behavior had changed drastically, he seemed almost embarrassed  to be talking to me, and when he did talk he made little attempt to  masquerade the condescension in his tone- often about how much money he  was making and, comparatively, how invaluable I was.  Seemed out of  character for my buddy? A few minutes ago I was his shiny pet he was  showing off to his coolest friends, on a ‘secret corporate project’ and  now I was a punching bag being mocked for how little a salary I would  fetch at his company.

&amp;#x200B;

Justin  Pearson was never looking to work for me, he was checking out whether  or not I was the 'real deal'- which he indicated at one point without further explanation.  He gave the nod to [Daniel Nichols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmnichols/) at [Red Cell Talent :](https://redcelltalent.com/) 

All  I can say right now, is that something or someone very powerful has  turned my life upside down, my credibility has been attacked, my  identity has been stolen, and all just prior to my rights being  attempted to dissolve along with possibly my ability to provide a future  for myself and family by being declared unfit for being an owner,  founder, member, or director of my own company due to being  ‘incompetent,’ which many operating agreements and article of  organization determine to be incapacitating for a leadership position,  often resulting in the dissolution of their company or the forfeiture of  a member’s interest.  


I have a hearing coming up with the VA, and I've been told I  needed $1800 for a competency test and ""several thousand"" for a lawyer to appear at the hearing with me.

&amp;#x200B;

“Are you speaking figuratively? Exaggerating?”

This is not mental illness speaking- I am legitimately being sharked.

I’m  positive that this large business entity has taken an ‘interest’ in me,  and has basically purchased my life and everything in it. Peers are very often staged, and potentially only becoming aware at this point in the game-  some peers are highly successful at coercion and manipulation. 

Here is my message to you, City of Tacoma, Tacoma Police Department, Victory Media, Verizon, Red Cell, VA, GOP:

I  see you setting me up with potentially another deliberate vehicle accident to set me up for additional fraud.

My  identity has been stolen, sabotaged prior to this hearing, and  ultimately peppered with acts of fraud to make me appear to be gaming  the benefits.

The FBI is going to become interested in you once they realize how corrupt you have made the GOP.",technology,1566485389,nicnacc253,1,1,True,2019-08-22 10:49:49

"Why Microsoft can bundle Windows with Edge, but Google can't do the same with Android/Google Chrome?"," Today I was reading about Google's case with the European Union, from March people will be able to choose which browser to use. And that reminded me of Microsoft, in the 1990s they had a similar problem, but they keep bundling windows with internet explorer today, and Bing as the default browser, and that left me with the following question: Why Microsoft Can bundle Windows with Edge, but Google can't do the same with Android/Google Chrome?",technology,1579044072,Sakul69,1,1,True,2020-01-14 18:21:12

Building a product to help you regain control over your smartphone usage (feedback wanted!),"One year ago it became obvious to us we had to change something about our smartphone usage. We were constantly checking our phone without reason. We both read books about it (Digital Minimalism was a big game-changer) and listened to podcasts (Your Undivided Attention, Waking Up, Future Thinkers). Which really made it clear that social media is designed to hook you, as more time on their platform is more money for them. 

We looked for different solutions, but all we could find were either minimalist phones or software (or a dumb phone, but we wanted to keep all the useful functionality of a smartphone). We tried a lot of the software, but it never really solved the problem, and the minimalist phones were just too expensive.

We then decided we want to dedicate our time to finding a solution. Since we're both students from the Delft University of Technology, we created some technology to battle technology (a bit ironic, isn't it). We developed a USB key in combination with an Android Launcher that empowers you to decide when to transform your Android phone into a distraction-free device. It basically gives you the ability to make a minimalist phone out of your smartphone whenever you want, so that you have more time to spend on the meaningful things in life.

We tested it out with 30 people now and reactions have been very positive (one guy even went from using his phone for 3 hours per day to using it only 30 minutes daily). You would greatly help us by providing feedback on the product; you can check it out here: [https://unplug.technology/](https://unplug.technology/) . If you have any feedback, could you send it to us on [info@unplug.technology](mailto:info@unplug.technology) or just reply here?

What has the web become?,"I am an avid user of uBlock Origin on my browsers, and not because I ""hate the site owners"" but because I am privacy-conscious and also hate obtrusive advertising (I try my best to whitelist unobtrusive sites). uBlock allows me to do away with all of that and maintain my sanity on the web.

Today, when I was reading an article on Wired, I thought I'd try and disable my content blocker, as I had taken it for granted for what seemed like years. Here's what I saw:

[uBlock on](https://i.imgur.com/nK5cLHo.png)

[uBlock off](https://i.imgur.com/ALzbceZ.png)

That's right. In that second shot, there's a half-height advertisement, a banner with a free article counter and membership sale covering the other half, a cookie banner with an accessible ""accept"" button and what I assume is a labyrinth of cookie settings to disable any sort of ad personalization, and finally an obtrusive popup asking for your email address.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the reporting that Wired does and I believe their standpoints on various topics are noteworthy, however this is not what I believe the experience of anyone attempting to access journalism should be.

I understand that this is a multifaceted issue, perhaps even every single one of those elements that I describe may lead to a heated debate. For starters, the issue of the sustainability of journalism in the age of the web, which seems to be the cause for nearly all of those obtrusive elements (advertising, paywalling, and perhaps newsletters). Also the cookie banner (or sometimes obscuring popup) that we see on nearly every site, and the issue of data privacy online.

I believe that it is possible for less obstructive and more respectful versions of resources such as this to exist. I shouldn't have to install a content blocker to access information on the web with peace of mind, as not even every internet user knows of such things. I should not be blocked out from journalism or any other sort of information, as not every user of the internet has the financial means to support every source they access. I should also, last but definitely not least, not have to click an obscured cookie options links and go through walls of legal language and options to make an informed decision about my personal data online.

I might seem like a choosing beggar at this point, but my sole aim of writing this is to ask, what do you think? Is this how you think the web should be? Or if not, how can we solve the underlying issues in better ways? For example, the Guardian has handled the paywall issue in a much more open and successful way, do you know of any other examples?",technology,1558790226,abdulocracy,269,546,True,2019-05-25 09:17:06

Why isn't there some kind of default-focus flag in CSS or on pages in general that can say ""once loaded in focus, set cursor here"" so developers can tag their search bars as their starting point?

Animal Fostering Web Application,"[RescueFoster.com](https://rescuefoster.com/)

Greetings! I work for a start-up that builds technology for animal welfare. We have built a web application that makes it easy for rescues and shelters to foster out animals temporarily [RescueFoster.com](https://RescueFoster.com). Check us out and I'd appreciate any feedback. This app gives shelter staff an opportunity to use something better than spreadsheet and thick paper binders when it comes to figuring out what animal can go to what homes they already have available.

The honest truth is that if more people like you and me took in cats and dogs on a temporary basis less animals would be put down. We need more rescues and shelters to sign up, our goal is one rescue or shelter in every state by the end of the year. No animal is more grateful than the one you pull out of a kennel. Even an overnight sleepover at a foster home reduces ""shelter stress"" that these animals get at overcrowded animal shelters. Animals are infinitely more adoptable in and after foster care.

Google may not stop with blocking adblocking on just Chrome," If you're not familiar, Google will soon severely cripple ad blockers in Google Chrome, making them essentially useless - [https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/buwca4/google\_just\_gave\_2\_billion\_chrome\_users\_a\_reason/](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/buwca4/google_just_gave_2_billion_chrome_users_a_reason/)  

The thing is, if Google has finally showed its hand and decided to go down this path, why stop at just chrome? We can possibly start seeing ""unblockable"" ads in YouTube. Similar to what twitch has implemented now. As of now, no ad blocker can block one of these ads on twitch. Because they are integrated directly into the stream itself.  It would not matter what browser you used or if that browser allowed adblockers to work to their fullest ability.

So, Google being the biggest tech company in the world, it would be naive to think that they \*couldn't\* implement something similar to this on YouTube. Right now, the only reason we can block Youtube ads is because they are letting us.

 With the changes coming to Chrome, it would not be so farfetched to think Google will start using everything in its power to block people from blocking ads on YouTube and the rest of its services.  Even ads on google search. Google has clearly not made a gigantic effort as of now to stop adblockers from blocking search result ads. But could you imagine if they put their full money and tech know-how behind making technology to stop adblocking on all of its services (and worse, even offered this tech for use to third-parties for their sites).

Best Way To Record Live TV On A Computer Using A TV Tuner,"Hi everyone,

I have question about using a TV tuner card to record live TV on a computer. Since I plan on commenting on the news as part of Fair Use Law, I'd like to edit news segments with Adobe Premiere Pro after saving the video files from live TV onto my computer using, of course, a TV tuner. The question I have is: Should I do it on the computer that I plan to do the video editing on or should I buy a separate desktop to do the live TV recording, and then transfer the video files to my main computer for later editing?

The reason I'm asking is because I've read that if I use the same computer to record live TV that I use to do the video editing that I should avoid doing anything on my computer while the live TV is recording or else the PVR software won't record properly, and not being able to use my computer while it's recording is something that I'd like to avoid.

Thanks for all your help,

I recently had a very bad injury on my right hand and I'm not able to write. I have a couple exams coming up and I can avoid writing some of them by doing presentations.

One of these presentations has to be related to something technical, I can choose the topic by myself.

TikTok Isn’t Only For Teenagers Lip-syncing: It’s Also Used To Unravel Human Rights Atrocities in China,"When it comes to the development of tech, the negative effects of tech is something I usually always think about first:

* be it creating a government sponsored internet as public good [(but what about China and Russia?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/what-is-to-be-done-about-the-ad-based-internet-economy/9821/54))
* developing smart cities ([but what about authoritarian regimes?](https://edgeryders.eu/t/edgeryders-internet-of-humans-fellows-interviews-and-podcasts-with-peter-bihr/10423))
* decentralized messaging apps ([but what about hate speech/pedophiles/terrorism](https://edgeryders.eu/t/decentralized-risks-hosting-information-for-others-comes-at-a-cost/9953))
* or how “good-intended research” on facial recognition is [being used by bad actors - and what should done about it](https://edgeryders.eu/t/when-your-tech-is-used-to-imprison-and-torture-people/10768).

But sometimes, the tech is either used as it’s supposed to, as t[he increase in mesh networks during the Hong Kong protests](https://edgeryders.eu/t/hong-kong-mesh-network-use-up-3685/10686/6) shows, or there’s **TikTok that doesn’t only show “Snappy, Short, Cut to pop music” videos**.

A little bit of back-story: Xinjiang, China is an information vacuum. With reports of a million Uyghurs in detention, plus censorship, surveillance and a blackout on outside communication, it’s hard to know what’s happening. But [some TikTok users have started using the app to share visual clues about life under Xinjiang surveillance](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/tiktok-uyghur-china/). That’s why international Uyghur activists are digging deep into TikTok &amp; similar apps. They’ve found videos that show China’s ongoing destruction of Uyghur and other Muslim architecture, checkpoints with long lines of Uyghurs waiting to go through, and videos of crying people in front of pictures of their relatives. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is behind China’s firewall. To gain entry, international Uyghur activists have to use Chinese phones. To find compromising content from Xinjiang TikTok, the Uyghur activists “game” the app’s algorithm, which serves them content according to how they respond to each video. Searching isn’t an option. Location-based TikTok search results are cleaned up by moderators. But still, videos make it through, and are downloaded by the activists and then reshared on other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so they don’t disappear. 

TikTok - obviously - wasn’t made to share human rights violations, but for some it has become the only tool to let the world know what’s happening.

"Radix DLT successfully replaying BTC history twice, with peaks of over 1 Million TPS."," 

Last week, we’ve replayed BTC history on the 12th and 13th of June.

On the 12th, we’ve peaked at 1 089 887 TPS. 

On the 13th we’ve managed to reach 1 210 938 TPS

On the 19th, 17:00 London time we’ll try to reach over 1 million TPS again.

**Why is this test different?**

We’ve used the entire BTC ledger to perform this test on a network of over 1000 nodes, spread across the world, in 17 cities around the world. It’s the first test that used objectively verifiable data - Bitcoin has processed a large number of transactions over the last decade (over 400 million transactions and 460 million addresses) and is an open, fair and transparent data set. The test is performed with **full transaction and signature validation.**

**Interested in how we did it?** 

The following technical blog posts explain our methodology and the step-by-step chronology of how we achieved this throughput.

* [Part 1: A primer on the scalability test and Radix (non-technical)](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/test-method-part1/)
* [Part 2: How we actually built the scalability test (technical)](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/test-method-part2/)

**Where can I see the test?**

Gaze into the new realm to shopping through Beacon!,"The days of parents holding the hands of their children while they go shopping in crowded places or busy streets has ended for a while now. In the past decades, we see both parents and children holding mobile in their hands, which is similar to interlocking hands with brands like Apple, Samsung other devices to ensure that they are safe.  
No doubt that the Google MAPS and location sharing options are the new virtual handshakes that make two parties meet and also ensure the other party that, they are safe. We do this with a lot of people to ensure that our rides arrive on time where we are supposed to be picked up from, allowing sales reps to be on time to the client's offices also including the starstruck lovers to be aware of where their soulmate is heading to.  
Why not capitalize on this relationship between people and mobile by acting as the beacon lights guiding people to the right store by making use of the notification services and sending offer messages to eyes glued to the phones traveling through the alley of stores? This is what is the thought of most of the shopping malls or store owners, who can afford to buy beacon devices to send out notifications.

These offer notifications are acting as beautiful treats to the eyes of the customer and are turning the subconscious ""Wants"" to ""Needs"" most of the time, and are leading to purchases for many users. There are many shopping malls nowadays who are taking advantage of the beacon devices to not only guide people but also to ensure that stores enlist their offers and share the same with the users of the app.

It is cool, cause it is similar to the doors to the wonderland which entertains you and keeps you occupied even when you are out there in those malls just to kill your time or boredom. Trust me, it all starts when you download the app when you enter the mall to guide yourself through it and the rest (notifications) are just the candy rain (offers) in which you are going to be drenched.

If you have a smartphone device with an active internet connection you would be thrilled by the journey this would give you.

Good people of /r/technology. It is time to take a stand.,"Following on from the announcement by Larry Sangler of a [Social Media Strike.](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/social-media-strike/) /r/technology  is joining the strike. 

&gt; On July 4 and 5 (at least one day), people with serious grievances against social media—including you?—will go on strike. You could, but obviously don’t have to, announce that you are one of the signatories of the Declaration of [Digital Independence](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence).

&gt; This means we will not use social media on those days, except to post notices that we are on strike. We’re going to make a lot of noise. Nobody will be able to ignore what’s happening. We’re going to flex our collective muscles and demand that giant, manipulative corporations give us back control over our data, privacy, and user experience.


Given the last 12 months of revelations about [Facebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Facebook&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year),  [Twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Twitter&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Google&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Youtube&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Reddit&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year) etc  we show solidarity with this position and believe everyone should be aware of their Digital Rights. 

To that end on the 4th of July /r/technology will be closed and private  for 24 hours. 

# What you can do today.

Make banners, Logos or another other eyecatching images others can post to social media. A variation on the overly optimisic [Social Media Day 2014 splash](https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MqiK4DFhGOD7uILqU5fpCUiEhog=/1438x0/2014%2F06%2F30%2Fed%2F16by9.94496.jpg) (how long 5 years has become) might be a good start. Feel free to share your images in this thread. 


# What you should do on July the 4th 2019

* Post only to social media to spread the issue. Link back to the [Declaration of Digital Independence.](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence) State your solidarity witht the strike.
* Walk away from all social media. Go do something more productive instead. Americans should eat drink and be merry just don't share it on social media. 
* Take the time to consider why you feel the need to rely on social media to make you life meaningful. 



Please as always keep your discussion civil and within the rules. This is a temporary warning message and will be removed following the strike.",technology,1562142448,veritanuda,16,22,True,2019-07-03 04:27:28

Video Editing using html5 in frontend and php 7.3 in backend," 

Hey everybody,

i was looking for a video editing tool we can implement to our website, so customers are able to upload videos and editing them befor they get postet.

Since we are proramming in PHP, we would prefer an editior written in PHP. In the Frontend we are using HTML5 javascript. It's not neccessary that it can convert.

We are looking for severeal features included:

1. Cutting
2. Trimming
3. Picture in Picture
4. merching videos
5. include custom watermark
6. Lower thirds
7. Intro / Outro

Main thing is, since we are a startup trying to reduce costs, we would prefer a cost free solution.

I'm not sure if this is the right thread to post in, but i guess we are professionals but not just editors. Just some physicist with an idea ;). I would be very glad if someone have a solution for us.

I got scammed and immediately closed my paypal account. Did I do the right thing?,"So apparently this guy is on the international list of scammers.

Advice needed on how to gain quality access to windows 10.,"*tldr; I have a macbook pro and want access to windows 10, not sure what the best course of action is.*

So two years ago I switched from windows 7 to a macbook pro. Instantly loved the machine, that never changed. Its expensive but it's lightning fast as I very rarely need use it in all its power. So it's most of the time just a very overpowered browsing and word processing machine and I love that it handles everything so easily. (I occasionally run large datasets through R and photoshop twice a month for fun)

However, I recently stumbled upon some niche windows-only software that I tried out in a VirtualBox. I start to run into UX problems as windows 7 in VB isn't perfect and I don't like having to have a virtual machine running non-stop, as it drains battery like crazy and it doesn't feel right to have my laptop run two operating systems all the time.

So basically I'm exploring my options on how to get access to windows 10. I do think I would like to keep using the windows-only software every day. Please consider that I'm not a rich person, so a cheaper option is preferable. However, I'm not willing to compromise performance for saving a few bucks. Its far more important to me to have a very good laptop than to save a some money, I just prefer to not needless spend too much. I've thought about the following two things:

* **Sell my macbook and buy a quality windows machine**

This is safe, as a windows laptop will work out of the box. My macbook has remained most of its value so I could sell it and get an ultrabook or something. On the pro list for this option is that I know that windows will run well. However, a disadvantage is that most windows machines are loud. I'm in the library a lot I don't like all the cheap fans that make windows machines sound like they're going to fly out the window. I'm very hestitant about that, a loud laptop is a deal breaker, and this is hard to determine noise over the internet. 

Are there quiet windows machines? Which ones do you recommend? I think I'll be able to sell my current machine for 900-1000 euros. So I would be in the market for anything below 1300 euros.

* **Upgrade my SSD and install windows 10 via bootcamp**

So my macbook is a 128gb machine. And for windows they recommend a minimum partition of 128gb. If I would create a dual boot I would have to upgrade my SSD. For about 300 euro's I can get a 500gb macbook pro ssd from the same lineup. Then I could buy windows 10 for 130 euros, I'm able enough to swap them out myself. Alternatively, I could get a samsung evo ssd for far less, same manufacturer, will performance suffer?

This option has a whole range of different questions though. How well does Windows 10 run on a macbook pro? I can't find much on google except a tonload of how-to guides, but very very little reviews and it seems that the majority isn't necessarily positive on how well windows runs on a macbook. Drivers would be missing and more of those kind of inconveniences.

A massive pro on this is that I'll be able to retain my macOS, so if it turns out that I don't need the windows-only software anymore I can very easily swap back. Besides I'll be able to keep this machine, which is of amazing build quality and is very quiet. 

So basically I need some advice, I tried to be as complete as possible but surely I've omitted valueable information, please feel free to ask. 

Thanks in advance for any answers, It's highly appreciated!",technology,1560113635,CappieXL,1,1,True,2019-06-09 16:53:55

For those maths based research proofs that mathematics ends in meaninglessness," case studies that  prove mathematics/science end in meaninglessness: prove nihilism:all products of human thought end in meaninglessness by Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man with 9 degrees including 4 masters: B,Sc, BA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, B.Litt(Hons), MA, MA (Psychoanalytic studies), Master of Psychoanalytic studies, Grad Cert (Literary studies) : who proved Godels theorems to be invalid

argues all products of human thought end in meaninglessness

examples/case studies

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/324037705/All-Things-Are-Possible-philosophy

2)Mathematics ends in contradiction:6 examples example 1 it is proven 1+1=1

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/40697621/Mathematics-Ends-in-Meaninglessness-ie-self-contradiction

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) it is proven an integer = a non-integer

1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.888... does not stop

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

""Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant""

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense

You can prove Nihilism is objectively true

Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man

HAS SHOWN

First you can prove by logic all products of human thinking end in meaningless

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

Now natural language is inconsistent “now it is clear from the work of Tarski that the language of everyday speech is” semantically closed” and hence inconsistent”""

thus

""Now with the inconsistency of language all possible views and their negation are now possible""

""Each view contains within it its negation as all views end in meaninglessness""

Second you can then prove using that logic that the logic you use ends in paradox

How do I upgrade from windows 7 to 10 and what do I have to replace to avoid a possible virus,"I have a computer that is currently running on windows 7 and I’m curious as to how I would have to remove and replace to make it compatible with windows 10.

I don’t have much experience with taking apart and putting together computers so any advice would be much appreciated.

Don't you think smartphones by now should allow us more ease in typing?,"I shouldn't need to spend a tap on my screen every time I want to switch between cases, punctuations and the regular alphabets. Using NLP and my writing history, my keypad should change accordingly with what I type. At the very least, if there's a '-' between the words ""well"" and ""known"" in the word ""well-known"", I shouldn't need to switch to the punctuations tab after typing ""well"". The keypad should change automatically by replacing the letter 'q' with a '-' since there aren't any words that start ""wellq"".

Basically, do some work in the background to make good use of the keypad space and make the user a happy chap. Sounds like a fair deal to me.

Identification crisis: the Golden age of fraud,"It’s no secret that we live in a world where everything can be done remotely. Banking, government services, property management and more are available from your mobile phone. In addition to the obvious advantages such as timesaving, transparency and ease of use, the new service channels have disadvantages, the main of which is remote fraud. The fraudster no longer needs to be physically present at the scene of the crime, and it becomes almost impossible to catch them.

The physical presence does not guarantee us against fraud, but it does make a high price error for the fraudsters, they can be caught red-handed right on the spot. High risks kept large numbers from fraud in the pre-digital era. However, remote services removed this restriction. According to Symantec Inc., every second Internet user faced cybercrime.

In fact, the perpetrator could take over our entire lives by faking our identity. In this context, the tasks of human identification come to the fore. More and more complex methods of identification are used. First, we came up with the identification of the fingerprint, but for a long time fraudsters have learned to make a fingerprint and overcome this barrier. Then we learned to identify a person by voice quite accurately, but even now, filters like Lyrebird allow us to fake any voice with amazing accuracy. There is similar case with identification through video, AI services have already learned to generate video indistinguishable from the original, creating three-dimensional holograms is a question of time.

Moreover, modern technologies make offline channels more vulnerable too, modern makeup is very difficult to distinguish from the real person, and the pattern of fingerprints and the iris is easily applied to silicone pads or lenses.

All these gives rise to great concern, it will take some 10 years and the scammers will be able to completely fake a person. What’s left? The answer is seen in DNA identification. The cost of DNA testing every year is a multiple of decreases and this is the thing that we will not be able to fake for a long time. I hope so we will get a reliable method of identification for several decades. But it is not accurate…",technology,1563132785,TsyIvan,1,1,True,2019-07-14 15:33:05

Supreme Court Rules Anti-Trust Lawsuit Filed Against Apple May Proceed," 

Apple had an unfavorable review by the Supreme Court and SCOTUS has ruled an anti-trust suit brought against Apple by consumers may  proceed. Its basis is Apple’s monopolistic practices governing “i”  devices as it relates to their ability to install and purchase apps ONLY  through their App Store.s about to receive the comeuppance for their overly restrictive iOS walled garden.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this will be one of the largest tech anti-trust cases in the last 10  years whose outcome won't only serve as an industry bell-weather, but could radically reshape Apple's i-device product  strategy, the walled garden, Apple revenue models, app developers access  iOS devices, consumer pricing for apps, consumer choice, etc. etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The wall garden, something which is not a practice in MacOS / OSX (*although  about 4 updates ago, Apple made it harder to install non-signed  software by “hiding” the ‘install from anywhere’ option. Users must now  open Terminal and type in a command line instruction to shut down  gatekeeper. A process which was not documented, the ordinary user would  be unfamiliar with and maybe even intimidated by*), has been touted by Apple for a decade now as necessary for security. 

&amp;#x200B;

The suit has the same basic premise of the FTC suit against Qualcomm: The royalties Apple charges developers on Apps and in game purchases, often as high as 30%, artificially raises prices to consumers and as Apple walls off any  other method of app installation (without Jailbreak of course which  voids the warranty), consumers are restricted of choice, competition is stifled, and owners of “i” devices must pay higher prices while  developers make lower profit.

&amp;#x200B;

If the  ruling is unfavorable, this is going to shatter Apple’s device and app  revenue model. Apple have to make an open the file structure section of  iOS or create an enclave that doesn’t restrict a user from side loading  apps to their device that have not been signed by Apple.

As  far as royalties, I can imagine Apple would have to adjust their policy  and who knows - the judge may even impose a fine for economic harm  imposed to developers and consumers. Why should Apple be entitled to a  share of revenue when a kid purchases a new dance move in Fortnite?

Apple  played no role in the development of the game, does not provide updates  to the game, takes no capital risk, nor provided or maintains the game  servers or communication network needed to play the game - so why should  Apple be entitled to royalties.",technology,1558749896,ShadowDancer11,2,4,True,2019-05-24 22:04:56

Computer Chips,"Okay, so I wanna learn about chips, let's take the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X for example. 12 cores, meaning it has 12 CPUs that can read instructions from the OS and execute those instructions. 24 cores means it can execute 24 lines of code at once, meaning each CPU can execute 2 lines of code at once. My first question is that would it take that CPU the same amount of time to execute one thread and two threads? Or does it take more time to execute two threads but less time than executing one thread after another? Then the clock speed, it has a base speed of 3.8Ghz. Does that mean each core has a base speed of 3.8Ghz, or is it distributed between 12 cores? And this means it can run code 3.8\*10\^6 times per second. Finally the chip cache is for accessing data when needed quickly. It's quicker than accessing the RAM, and it's usually for repeated data or data you need next? So it has 64MB cache.

"The Hover Cart, small Tech &amp; Gaming site with around 5.2k followings, looking for volunteer writers."," 

Hi all, I'm Luis from The Hover Cart, a Tech / Gaming media site from Singapore. I started the website around 2 years back, in my university days. It originated as a simple ecommerce website and this year, it reformed into a Tech / Gaming site.

To build up content for the site, I'm currently looking for volunteer writers to write articles ( \~1000 words) exploring the Tech &amp; Gaming world. Though as of now, the site is not able to provide any financial benefits, writers will be featured on our site, social media platforms &amp; email newsletter. In the future, once there's a regular sufficient income, volunteers will be able to receive remunerations moving forward.

Current initiatives on the site:

* THC Tech, our tech blog.
* THC Gaming, our gaming blog.
* Discover Games, segment where individual games given their own page for the game info, screenshots &amp; discussion area for those to share their thoughts about the game. \* current focus on switch games, more platforms to be added soon\*

As of now, THC has a social media following of 5.25k. I hope to grow it further with regular content and better engagement initiatives. Recently also started a patreon page in a bid to build up a source of income for the site. [https://www.patreon.com/thehovercart](https://www.patreon.com/thehovercart)

If you are keen to contribute as a volunteer writer, do PM me and we can carry on from there. **Thanks for your time reading this post.**

1. Id like to extend the display to the monitor and possibly use the tablet as a second screen. 
2. Don’t care too much about size (8-10”)
3. I’ll mainly be surfing the web, on social media, using google sheets/docs, streaming sports games and movies.

Stop saying clear your cache and cookies!! 🤬,"Ok so the reason for the title, too many times it seems people think this is the end all-be all solution to get your systems working. Come on! 

I work for a big tech company. Been there 8 years. And it irks me that I have all this knowledge, yet there are people in positions who tout these heavyweight titles such as ""Program Manager"" and ""Systems Analyst"" who don't even know what they're talking about. I'll tell you what happened.

Situation was that yesterday everyone experienced an outage of one of our main customer databases and nobody had access to it. It is a Microsoft service based on the cloud Office 365 ecosystem. So the error we were getting was ""User account is disabled. You do not have permission to access the service"". Ok so obviously to me this says that my user account is disabled on the server or on the back end somewhere. So I report this to them and all I kept hearing was ""have you cleared your cache and cookies?"" 
""Did you try a different browser and clear your history??""
""Did you dip your cookies in milk and clear them?"" (kidding)
HELLO!!! Read the error message! It says my user profile is disabled! There's no amount of clearing my browser history that's going to reenable my user account!  Stop being condescending throwing these demands around and get on the phone and tell Microsoft what the real problem is and to focus on reenabling the accounts!!

256GB Micro SD vs 512GB Micro SD?,"I'm debating to whether get a 256GB or a 512GB Micro SD card for my Nintendo Switch. My main question is, in terms of life span, which card would outlast the other? Does size of a card have any impact on the life span (Bigger the size= shorter lifespan or vice versa)? The amount of games I'm going to buy, the 256GB will probably be enough space. However if larger the size of a card the longer it'll last, than I wouldn't mind going for the larger card.

So basically if I only use say 150GB of space, would it be better for the life span of the card on a 256GB or 512GB? Or does size vs life spans is a non issue and I should purely focus on how much space I need? Also I like the idea that with a 512GB I will never have to worry of maxing out.

Thoughts on how hiring works in Tech?,"Recently, I came across a few ""SOFTWARE ENGINEERS"" in the big 4 and a few fintech topsies, who took me by surprise. Heres how it went.

I was shocked to see how they even lacked to use the basic concepts of Git and were more than clueless on how to even revert their commits. In terms of App development, the same case there as well.

It's pathetic to see such atrocities happening in hiring and how they can bullshit their way through and work in top firms. I don't know whether to feel ashamed or proud of these developers who can easily get jobs and I can't lol.

Ideally, would a job in software to a dud be worth 100k? Is this the way tech hiring works, cos most of the tech events I go to have the same people. PS: This is not to brag about my knowledge, else I would have a job in tech.",technology,1571251513,god_of_poop__,1,1,True,2019-10-16 14:45:13

Indian Police Use Drones To Track Down Maoists and Weed Cultivation,"Drones are now being used by the Indian police to track Maoist movements, red sander smugglers, weed cultivation and movements of anti-social elements during jataras, dharnas, and rallies. “We are using drones to check the movements of Maoists in thick forests. Drones were given to almost all Left Wing Extremism (LWE) police stations in the State,” a senior police officer said.

Furthermore, the forest officials are dependent on drones to track red sanders smugglers. Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are also being deployed by the police during annual religious events and political programs to keep a vigil on the movements of trouble-mongers.

AnoSquad introduction - the whole new chatting experience,"I personally really love being anonymous, I really love I can be completely myself as the other person doesn't know anything about me. I only have to follow my own principles. That's the reason I began thinking about something completely new and that's how the idea behind AnoSquad borned. It is an anonymous chatting site with never seen a base idea.

Actually I am a hobby developer who wants to create something good, new, quality and useful. I am really curious what others think about my idea.

On AnoSquad, you can talk in small anonymous groups where people do not know anything about each other, so you can see the way others behave with each other. Groups are started with four members and they can also vote about kicking each other, so it's self-moderating. There's also chance to chat in private messages with the members of the groups, it completely gives the chance to find new friends, have fun, banish your boredom or anything else.

[Mod Post] Proposal banning pay walls and capped visit sites. Looking for input.," Reddit was created as a way to foster discussion; /r/technology is no exception to that. In that spirit, we are going considering a ban on submissions of websites that have a paywall (hard or soft) or have a capped number of visits. Yes, we know that there are work-arounds, but that also works around the purpose of this move. We, the mods of /r/technology, hope that we can encourage websites to allow access to their content for others to enjoy without cost to visitors.

Facebook is seriously SCARY.,"So I was using facebook and I wanted to interact with one of the pages. It was like a page full of confessions from people but I don't want to use my main account to post there. I might get exposed since its pretty embarrassing lol. So I went and created a new gmail account. Then a new facebook account. I logged out of my main facebook account and created a new account just for the sake of that confession group.

So I created the account verified some things. And the next thing scared me. Add Friends. All suggested friends were friends that I knew in real life. I was genuinely scared since I didn't link my phone in my gmail nor link a recovery email in that dummy gmail. It seriously didn't have any access to how facebook knows who my friends are. It showed a BUNCH of people that I knew personally. And its scaring the shit out of me. I'm using the web version of facebook to create an account.

Deciding the need of a Big Data Infrastructure,"## What is Big Data?

Big data is characterized as the data that can not be prepared by customary methods and systems, because of its large size and complexity. The word Big in big data means petabytes or exabytes of data. It is calculated that nearly 90% of the data that we have today has been generated in the last two years. This implies; exponential growth in data volume is going to proceed. This growth will increase further with the increase in IoT (Internet Of Things).

Data analytics mainly uses Big Data. It gives necessary insights into business operations of any business. It helps businesses in growth, competitiveness and profitability.

## Need of Big Data –

There are many challenges for handling a huge data in applications. Big data is no longer growing trend. This is now time-tested, accepted with a sound, secure, stable architecture. It is synchronized with information, generating efficient analytics by organizations, ranging from data oriented start-ups to big technology giants around the globe. There are many tools on the internet, there is considerably more to it than Big Data alone.

If you hold a large amount of various data, and from this you need to find out answers at fast, you may look at the opening gates called “the three V’s” of the data. This means that you are ready to look at better solutions that fulfils your need of data. Can you say that it is enough? Of course not.

Do you want to turn your existing application asset to a bigger store for a theoretically possible performance? How big are your existing data security issues and how would you deal with the same on the new infrastructure? Is your data “big” enough for these solutions? Such questions carry you to a point where you have to think about a couple of significant things. You realize that first, the idea of building an efficient big data infrastructure, lies the need to build a decision on whether to present a big data infrastructure or not.

## Why you should need big data in an organization?

Organizations or businesses requires a big data services to allow them to survive in a fast growing and increasingly competitive market where the sources and the requirements to store data are growing at exponential manner. To handle high volumes, the data storage should be elastic and scalable. Cloud based storage is a better idea for most businesses because it reduces investments. There are no physical systems on site, means that it saves space and power consumption. It handles the data security issues. You require tools to enable virtualization and carry out data compression. You should require object-based storage architecture to handle a large amount of files. organizations are looking out for the solution that can store complex unstructured data and which do not have predefined schemas.

Big Data solutions do not force a schema onto the stored data. Instead you can store any type of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data and then apply a suitable schema when you query this data. Big data solutions store data in raw format and apply a schema only when the data is read. This preserves all information within the data. This is contradictory to the way of traditional database.

## Data Magnitude Determination-

In 1997, the first documented use of the term “big data” appeared in paper by scientists at NASA. It describes the problem facing by them with visualization. Generally data sets are large, taxing the capacities of main memory, local disk and remote disk. This problem is Big Data. When there is a situation like data sets don’t fit in main memory, or when they do not fit on local disk also, in such cases the solution is to acquire more resources.

Another most important factor is what you want to do with the data. The problem is big data solutions is that they are numerous. Getting the perfect tool is important for the cost, efficiency and delivery constraints also. Creating an understanding of these factors is a main requirement of big data infrastructure requirements.

## Necessity of Advanced Analytics-

An interesting thing that gives thought on analytics is- one of the financial services firm which turned to big data to better identify which new client opportunities warrant the most investment. The organization enhanced its client statistic information with third party data purchased from eBureau. The data service provider appended sales lead opportunities with buyer’s occupation, earnings, age, retail histories and also related factors. The advanced data set is then applied to an algorithm. This identifies which new client leads should receive additional investment and which should not. The result has been 11% hike in new client win rates. At the similar instance, the firm has lowered sales related expenses by 14.5%. 

There are some benefits that big data analytics offer are – Getting answers to complex business problems, creating cost effective requirements to bring in more customers, analyzing existing values to predict faster and better business decisions, and also exploiting machine learning analytics to make self learning systems.

## Right time for data transition and security issues-

Data-driven transition must start with your business goals and also objectives. As you understand your business objectives then you are ready to create a roadmap for leveraging new data sources to help you achieve them. Also, technology is not only enough to transform your organization into a data-driven organization. Creating a platform that understands data, securing the data and how to use it is just as necessary. The challenge of detecting and also preventing advanced persistent threats has bought the importance of security responsibilities in light.",technology,1567753115,SolaceInfotech,0,1,True,2019-09-06 02:58:35

Why are we phasing out the 3g network/ does that mean that we can only use smart phones?,"I am a 20 something human who has had a smartphone since I was 13. Recently I have realized how much time my smartphone costs me. As in quitting any bad habit, I have been looking into alternatives. I wanted a phone that didn’t have all the features my current phone has. I don’t really need access to the internet on my phone, I have a laptop that hardly gets used. So my search ended when I found my dream phone: the 2017 edition of the Nokia 3310. This is apparently a 3g phone. After searching the web for off brand phone networks like cricket, ting, mint, I realized a lot of them didn’t take this model of phone. Then I called larger networks who also said they are no longer taking on 3g phones. This struck me, so I called up the local Verizon store to ask how much their “dumb phones” were. They only had one, it was a flip phone and was $240. I was shocked. He also mentioned that the phone wouldn’t work once they phase out 3g. So it got me thinking...are smartphones about to be the only option with the approach of 5g? I just need someone to direct me to a cellphone with minimal capabilities. I no longer want to waste my time.",technology,1573951959,akida-0-,20,1,True,2019-11-16 19:52:39

Microsoft developing AI tool to diagnose cervical cancer faster,"World  Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cervical cancer is the fourth  most frequent cancer among women worldwide. India accounts for 16% of  global cervical cancer patients and an increase in demand for cervical  cancer demand has been worryingly seen.

SRL  Diagnostics is the largest diagnostics laboratory in India and they  receive around 100,000 pap smear samples every year. A cytopathologist  in their Mumbai laboratory alone screens around 200 slides for cervical  cancer every day in addition to 100 other slides for other types of  cancer.

To  solve the problem of the low proportion of cytopathologists available,  SRL Diagnostics partnered with Microsoft to create an AI network that  would have an API to enable screening out of normal slides, so that the  cytopathologists could concentrate on the abnormal slides. This would  give a huge boost in the overall speed of screening as only 2% of all  samples turn out to be abnormal and need deeper analysis. 

To develop the AI algorithm, cytopathologists studied digitally scanned versions of...

I have put dummy security cameras, shoes at the front, keep the light on inside, radio playing 24/7

but really they can still just turn the mains off and if they see no one come outside to look they have a free run inside

Issues with Getting my Laptop Replaced on Warranty by Microsoft..,"&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this isn't the wrong place to post this, but whatever...

So I bought a surface book on eBay. It was a replacement order from Microsoft and was in new condition, and still had a warranty on it for a bit of time.

When it arrived, **immediately** when I turned it on, the mouse started glitching. I didn't think much of it. A few months pass by, and I realize more and more issues with it.

When using two-finger scroll the screen flickers, the mouse always glitches, Bluetooth disconnects after 30 seconds without sound being played, audio not playing, and more. So I contact the seller on eBay, they explain how to get it replaced, and I do.

I have a to wait like a week and a half and call support and all that, and this was the second replacement on the device, but whatever. As long as it got fixed.

I get it back, turn it on, and you wouldn't believe it. **It had the SAME issues.** Mouse glitching, Bluetooth issues, audio issues, and screen flickering. I couldn't believe it. I contacted support and explained the issue, and they said they would replace it, AGAIN. I was upset because school had started and I use it for school a lot, and asked how this could be done as quickly as possible. They mentioned something called an ""advantage exchange order"", where basically they would send me the replacement while I still had the non-working one, and once I got it, then sent it in. Then I could still use it for school and all that. So they say you have to pay the original price until I returned mine, and I agreed. They said the price was $3000?? It was like $700 on eBay, and it has a performance base! I tried to make the payment, and it wouldn't go through they told me. They said to contact my bank, and me, not wanting to go through all this crap, just decided to exchange it normally like I did before.

I ask if I could do it later this year during break, so I didn't have to worry about missing it for school, and was told I could.

So now it's November, break is almost here, and I contact them. I ask if they can send the shipping label. I was given a response (email at this point) that I would need to make the order THAT day because my warranty expired THAT DAY. Ok, that's fine I think.

I go to the website to make the order, and **it said my warranty had expired**. I start to lose it a bit, I *NEEDED* to get this goddamn laptop fixed. I tried emailing the support agent, but being stressed and anxious, I tried just calling customer support. I call support many times and am not given the chance to talk to a human. Just told crap about getting a text message with a link and crap. Eventually I reach a support agent, thank god.

I explain the situation, the man asked for the id number for the email conversation I had with the agent at the time, and when he read the emails, he said since I was told I could get it replaced this break, that I can.

I email him yesterday and explain that THIS weekend is the perfect time to send it in, and said if he could send in the shipping label Friday or Saturday that would work great. He emailed back right away saying;

***Hello (My Name),***

***Good to hear from you, i hope you are doing great! yes definitely i can help you with that, i will make sure you get the label by tonight!***

***Regards,***

***(His Name)***

That was two days ago.

Now it's today, and almost 8, still no label.

I'm not trying to rant, but this is just annoying. This is the **THIRD** time this device has been sent in for replacement (including this time). Today was the PERFECT day to send it in, and now its too late. Am I crazy for being annoyed at all this? Any advice?

TL;DR: I have to get my laptop replaced for the third time, second since I've owned it. Was promised a shipping label the end of the day two days ago, still no label. Am very annoyed...",technology,1574660286,AnonymousUser2232,0,1,True,2019-11-25 00:38:06

Should we buy the new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1?,"A few weeks ago Dell presented their new Dell 13 2-in-1. Now obviously they also presented other laptops, but for me I was particularly interested in this one.

It seemed like the perfect laptop. It had the new Lake processor, new vents, new webcam, a 16:10 screen and more.
I couldn't wait to buy it (although they pushed the date forward from July 10th to August 2nd)!

And then today I read that Dell copied the worst thing of the Apple laptops: the SSD card will be soldered. Usually I'll never buy or recommend anything with a soldered SSD, since it makes it impossible to recover, upgrade or transfer data after purchase.
More things like the RAM will also be soldered, but that's less of an issue for me.

But then again, I really wanted it...so that got me thinking, is it worth it? Can we work around this issue, or is it a deal breaker?

User Experience of Arcade Game for Players," 

Most users are probably familiar with the arcade game.

Literally, it is a kind of game machine operated in the public  entertainment places. With new changes in science and technology,  people’s entertainments emerge in endlessly today. However, the nature  of business of arcade games, the fun of games, and the interaction  between strangers determine that arcade game has an unshakable status in  the market.

Arcade games mainly include 2 types, vertical frame and horizontal frame arcade game machine.

The middle section in front of the frame or the vertical position outside is used to display the[ **human-machine interaction touch LCD screen**.](http://www.stone-hmi.com/)

The biggest difference and attraction between arcade games and other types of games lies in the game controller. **The control panel** of  arcade game integrates the game control functions such as joystick,  button, trackball, light gun, and etc., which is the main part of **human-machine interaction**. At the same time, it is also an attractive feature of arcade games.

Secondly, the fun of games, immersive experience, incomparable  interactive rhythm, various entertainment consumption pattern (grabbing  dolls, coin dozer, sports series) and etc. is the soul of the game  machine. It is also the root cause of the arcade game machine still  standing.

The first experience of any game is very important. [**Touch LCD screen** sensitive, responsive, high quality sound effect, stable and accurate joystick, high resolution clear image](http://www.slw-ele.com/) is the most intuitive feelings of the customers. If these performances don’t work well, the players will go to other games.

If the players are very impressed with the game, they will continue  to play. For example, Neofuns’ children amusement facilities, it can  promote more easily the feelings between children in the collective game  environment with a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. Neofuns’ racing  motor, it has realistic sound background environment, which can give  players good game experience. While some player done well also attract  more people to stop. If new players have a bad experience for the game,  this kind of arcade game will be abandoned. Therefore, the first  experience of the game is very important, should seize the users’ first  experience, or the return on investment will be discounted.

One of the most popular features of arcade games:

When you are tired of walking on the street, waiting for the movie  ticket, under great work pressure and looking for an entertainment  project around you to relax, you can find the suitable arcade game mode  to relax.

Sometimes, we can meet some people who have the same hobbies as we  have when we play games. It is also a good way for us to increase  interpersonal communication. There are many kinds of game modes to meet  the needs for any occasion.

Should companies like Facebook and apple be broken up and if so how.,"Facebook and apple are two large companies that have both a massive influence on politics and the econmy. It makes me wonder if they should be broken into smaller companies to encourage competition aswell as reduce their influence. And if they shouldnt be broken down now how large they should get before being broken down. 

An important example would be standerd oil. At standerd oils peak they were worth 3 trillion dollars and controlled the American oil industry aswell as motor industry. They gained so much power that Theodore Roosevelt had the company broken down into the major oil companies we see today. The issue with breaking down apple is that unlike oil where you can easily divide it you cant with Apple. Apple has multiple assets with some doing better than others (The I phone and I tunes). And the best selling products require the other departments to function , so if 1 company was given the I phone and another the airpods they would have trouble collaborating to make the airpods work best on apple products. The most likely products to be split up would be apple phones and apple Macs but this wouldnt be equal as I phones are worth more to a company rather than Macs.",technology,1563099953,vaineratom64,16,0,True,2019-07-14 06:25:53

Need to catch a creep - best Android surveillance app?,"tl;dr: What are the best motion/audio activated surveillance apps for Android? Ideally one that uploads the footage to email or Youtube. Also any tips/ideas on how to catch this snooping weirdo/creep are welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiancee has a room mate who we're convinced sneaks into her room. She and I talk on Discord a lot and we fall asleep together on there. She's 5 hours behind me so when I'm leaving in the morning it's 3am there. Twice before hanging up I've heard her bedroom door open and close.

&amp;#x200B;

Her laptop screen switches off so when they come in they can't see that someone is there, I saw them walking around once like they were looking for something. She's a deep sleeper and didn't hear anything herself at first. However the past two nights she's blatantly heard someone closing her door and leaving. She can't install a lock due to how old the doors are, they're a weird design. She put a necklace on the doorhandle and the sound of this is what woke her the past 2 nights. I was going to say barricade the door but now I want them to come in so we can catch them on video.

&amp;#x200B;

So the plan is for her to sit her phone somewhere in the room with a motion/sound activated surveillance app. I use iSpy for Windows for security cameras and am wondering if there's anything like that for Android maybe with more features? (I heard some Android phones have infrared, could this work to see in the dark?)

"US-China Trade War, where are we going in terms of technology?","Huawei was meant to be one of the significant brands in the smartphone market within the next 2 to 3 years. Why wouldn't Google and other cellphone making companies grab this perfect opportunity to bring them down?

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, smartphones are the perfect result of Globalization. Think about it. Each component of your phone comes from different countries around the globe. A cellphone literally visits the whole planet before even getting assembled in the factory.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we are obviously moving towards a reality where this globalized phenomenons will start to break. If US-based organizations stop giving software support to Chinese companies then China has their batteries to not give to the US. Needless to say, Huawei is the still single champion when it comes to building mobile network equipment.

&amp;#x200B;

Both of the sides have enough resources to break another. You can use an Android phone without Google Play Store. You can't turn on a phone without a goddamn battery in it. You can't make a phone call or use the internet without a good network connection.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, it will be us, the consumers who will suffer the most. In a desperate attempt to survive, all of the companies will start building all the equipment themselves. It will increase the overall production cost of the devices as well. It will be a total mess.

&amp;#x200B;

The path we are moving towards is going to be the darkest era for global tech and there will be only one person to blame for that. I wish Donald Trump knew what he was starting.

What satellite tv channels can i access from one place?," I am new to this satellite and its related stuff. And i want some guidance and information. I search the internet but i can't find any organized and authentic answer to this question. What are the satellites that are receivable in my area where i live? Plz don't just refer me to some website about satellite (like lyngsat).etc.because i am a beginner and i visited these websites and these website only confuses me and will learn no way like from these website. Plz tell me in layman terms as much possible it is. My question is that (if budget is not an issue) in terms of buying items like satellite dishes,receivers,etc,.which are one time cost (OTC) then at the most how much percentage of tv channels can anyone receive at a place in which he/she lives.(meaning that if for example there are 15000 satellite tv channels in the entire world and someone receives 7500 channels then it means he/she receives 50 % of the satellite tv channels from the satellite channels of entire world. As i got answers/information from you people i will get more aware and then more questions will be arise in my mind. Also i m confuse about when people say like 78 E or 32 E .etc. I got really confused. SO plz for me and for all newbie about this stuff this would be a great post to learn. Also i heard there are scramble channels which are not free to watch. So how can we pay for scramble channels and then watch(also give examples for better understanding).

I've failed 3 out 4 technical interviews. Does it mean I cannot be a developer?,"Hi,

I am working currently for an IT services company as ""engineering consultant"". I am not happy right now about how we are being treated so I decided to find a final client.

This is my first job which I joined without passing a tech interview. Before that job, I applied for several jobs, getting rejections due to my experiences (not a lot cause I just have graduated).
And when I would have the attention of someone, the oral interview would be good, like they see I am a nice guy and I have knowledge of different technologies and stuff, they would submit me a technical interview which I messed it up. Let's take my last one (NodeJS API in 4 hours):

1 - functions were not separated and too big.
2 - had to have recursivity.
3 - I did not write every cases asked. The algorithm wasn't implemented entirely.
4 - Asynchronous is missing

I know how to separate functions so the code is easier to be red and understood.
I know how to apply recursivity.
I know how to use async/await. I am using them every day and abusively.

The common thing about these 4 issues, I knew all about but I didn't think about it at the moment.

It was like this during 3 out 4 interviews.

This is humiliating. Even though the interviews were not mean, this is humiliating. 

More over, back to studies, I used to be the worst guy of my group. Not the worst of the promotion.

Full Dive VR development difficulty?,"Hello all,
I just started thinking about this tonight. With elon apply for NeuraLink testing  in a year, i feel like fulldive vr may be much closer than I originally thought (100’s years). This led me to wonder if elon is successful how difficult would it be to make a full dive VR world?
The **coding** aspect of it seems(!) to be doable since we have things like oculus and vive where we have ‘created’ worlds inside of those headsets that players can interact with. 
The **NeuraLink** aspect of it seems to be the limit factor here if the coding part is as i assumed. If elon’s tests in the next, say, 5 years prove that humans can indeed control computers, will finding and poking sensors into the primary senses of humans(touch,hear,sight,feel,smell) be alot more difficult? Aren’t they just different parts of the brain?
Please tell me where I am wrong or right. I am just a rising college student who is very enthusiastic about the future of vr and cyborgy stuff.",technology,1563420513,Thewafflere,6,3,True,2019-07-17 23:28:33

Our phones monitor our speech,"For the last two years I have tried to convince my friends and family that our phones listen to us through our microphones, and one more than the others, youtube.

This is relevant to me at the moment because today me and my wife were trying to find something to watch. On a random chance we decide to give this old semi-shitty tv show called *true blood* a chance. After watching a few episodes out loud, we decide to chat about it the rest of the day. I then go onto youtube and watch does it recommend me? True blood. My youtube feed should absolutely **NOT** have true blood recommendations in it. It is completely irrelevant to the entire rest of my feed and viewer history. And it isn’t my wife’s viewing history as she doesn’t have or use youtube **at all**. It also isn’t my friends viewing history as I have had no friends for the past year (long distance move away from hometown). It is just me and my wife. We have had no prior searches or conversations relating to anything true blood, or the topics contained in the show. 

Now if this doesn’t convince you our microphones are listening to us maybe this will.

I used to work in a factory where there was a strict security guard searched no cellphone policy. One day I managed to sneak one in (cause fuck it) and listen to music with my other coworkers. After about an hour of one weird and wildly bored conversation to the next, one of my more humorous coworkers brings up how in the 2000s there was a crazy fad where people would use a cardboard tubes to put hamsters in their ass (you read that right). 
And this is an old redneck farmer that still has a flip phone, this motherfucker doesn’t have youtube, so no information sharing going on there. 

Now remember, not a single other person in this entire building has a fucking cellphone on them. And there is not a single internet network to connect to to link us as associates. Its illegal for us to say we worked at this place on facebook (via contract) so it couldn’t have connected us as coworkers from social media. 

Later that night I go onto my youtube, and this fucking app suggests me a video about  **HAMSTERS BEING PUT INTO PEOPLES ASSES** . Now maybe i’m crazy or maybe youtube’s feeling a little nostalgic about fads in the early 2000s. But hamsters in the asshole is just a little too coincidental for my liking. 
Why in any fucking lifetime would this app recommend me a video that specific, without listening to my conversations. And it goes without saying that no, my youtube feed consisting of people reacting to anime and 
unwarranted Jordan Peterson videos does not seem like the prime birthing ground for anal hamster suggestions. 

Now the kicker is that my microphone is turned off on youtube’s app as i’m paranoid about this kinda stuff. I mean these moments have happened to me so many times in the past few year that I can’t chalk it up to chance. This is a genuine positive correlation with very precise accuracy.

I can honestly say without a doubt, all our our conversations are 100% being monitored.",technology,1567410577,dedius,12,1,True,2019-09-02 03:49:37

Exit Scam?,"It is reported that users of Bitsane began to experience problems with the withdrawal of funds in may of this year. The exchange itself as the reasons called technical problems. By June 17, the exchange website and its social media accounts were deleted, and the letters sent by users were returned, as the recipient was not found.

Also, Forbes tried to contact CEO Bitsane Aidas Rupsis and technical Director of the exchange Dmitry Prudnikov without success. Prudnikov's LinkedIn profile was also deleted.

As of May 30, 2019, Bitsane's customer base consisted of 246 thousand people, the daily trading volumes of the exchange, according to CoinMarketCap data from March 31, exceeded $7 million.

The groups that Bitsane users have created in Telegram and Facebook say that on average traders have lost up to $5,000. A user that claimed to have lost $150,000 and requested to remain anonymous told Forbes:

“I was trying to transfer XRP out to Bitcoin or cash or anything, and it kept saying ‘temporarily disabled.’ I knew right away there was some kind of problem. I went back in to try to look at those tickets to see if they were still pending, and you could no longer access Bitsane.”

Some users suspect that another firm, Bitsane Limited, which was founded by Maxim Zmitrovich, may be linked to a possible exit Scam. Forbes contacted Zmitrovich, but he denied his involvement and said he had not spoken to Prudnikov for more than five months. Multiple account holders in the U.S. say they have filed complaints with the FBI, but all of them are concerned that their cash is gone for good.

Little tip for novice traders or hodlers:

if you decide to keep your funds on the exchange, try to find out as much information about it as possible. Talk to more experienced traders and find out what they think about the exchange you have chosen.

If you are hodler, keeping your funds on the exchange is not the safest method.

Good people of /r/technology. It is time to take a stand.,"Following on from the announcement by Larry Sangler of a [Social Media Strike.](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/social-media-strike/) /r/technology  is joining the strike. 

&gt; On July 4 and 5 (at least one day), people with serious grievances against social media—including you?—will go on strike. You could, but obviously don’t have to, announce that you are one of the signatories of the Declaration of [Digital Independence](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence).

&gt; This means we will not use social media on those days, except to post notices that we are on strike. We’re going to make a lot of noise. Nobody will be able to ignore what’s happening. We’re going to flex our collective muscles and demand that giant, manipulative corporations give us back control over our data, privacy, and user experience.


Given the last 12 months of revelations about [Facebook](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Facebook&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year),  [Twitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Twitter&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Google&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Youtube&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=Reddit&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=year) etc  we show solidarity with this position and believe everyone should be aware of their Digital Rights. 

To that end on the 4th of July /r/technology will be closed and private  for 24 hours. 

# What you can do today.

Make banners, Logos or another other eyecatching images others can post to social media. A variation on the overly optimisic [Social Media Day 2014 splash](https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MqiK4DFhGOD7uILqU5fpCUiEhog=/1438x0/2014%2F06%2F30%2Fed%2F16by9.94496.jpg) (how long 5 years has become) might be a good start. Feel free to share your images in this thread. 


# What you should do on July the 4th 2019

* Post only to social media to spread the issue. Link back to the [Declaration of Digital Independence.](https://larrysanger.org/2019/06/declaration-of-digital-independence) State your solidarity witht the strike.
* Walk away from all social media. Go do something more productive instead. Americans should eat drink and be merry just don't share it on social media. 
* Take the time to consider why you feel the need to rely on social media to make you life meaningful. 



Please as always keep your discussion civil and within the rules. This is a temporary warning message and will be removed following the strike.",technology,1562142665,veritanuda,17,2,True,2019-07-03 04:31:05

"Nvidia GameStream, Steam Remote Play, Intel Wireless Display and Windows Miracast, they all suck! Here is why!","So I like to have a low latency solution to stream games and Videos from my main PC with my most expensive hardware to my low spec bedroom PC.

&amp;#x200B;

I specifically have a Nvidia GPU to have the GameStream feature and use it normally to stream demanding games and videos via Moonlight for Windows. This works really nice, once I get it to work, but more often than I like, there is some Issue preventing me to get a connection via GamStream. Either it is GameStreaming having disabled itself automatically in GeforceExperience and not allowing me to enable it giving error message ""That didn't work, try restaring the PC!"" or  the SHIELD tab missing completely.

A clean Install of the drivers and restarts normally fixes this, until the error will popup up again for whatever reasons. Nearly everytime I want to use this feature, I end up having to reanistall the Nvidia drivers and rebooting the PC.

Am I asking too much to not have to do this everytime I want to use Nvidia GameStream? 

So as Nvidia fails, I try the Steam Remote Play feature. And despite both PC'S detecting each other, the screen remains Black, and I get error: ""couldn't connect to remote computer"". This is probably, because Steam is just a replacement for Nvidias Geforce Experience and if one fails, so does the other.

&amp;#x200B;

OK OK, Nvidia just makes Hardware and Steam just games, what they care about actually using it right. 

Lets check out solutions of companies that have really deep pockets like,  Intel's Wireless Display and Microsoft's Miracast features. Well despite having extra expensive compatible hardware, and dxdiag reporting   ""Miracast: Available, with HDCP"", the Connect App tells me that: ""Your PC or mobile device doesn't support Miracast, so it can't project **wirelessly**.""

&amp;#x200B;

LOL WIndows limits Miracast strictly to WIFI eventhough the system has a 1GBit LAN connection available to stream to other devices and despite WIndows claiming to have enabled Miracast over LAN since Version  1803 ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-hub/miracast-over-infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-hub/miracast-over-infrastructure)).

&amp;#x200B;

Libreteca.net: a network of projects to update ebook technology for the Information Age,"Hi, I'm the founder of \[[libreteca.net](https://libreteca.net)\]([https://libreteca.net](https://libreteca.net)), a network of projects that aim to be an evolution and revolution in digital reading, writing and ebook technology. I want to change the landscape in digital publishing, which I find lacking, and to do that I research radical new ideas and develop applications and services to implement them and offer them to the world.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m developing a new kind of digital book format, named Libre, that encompasses at least ebooks, audiobooks, comicbooks, blogs, podcasts and webcomics. And that’s just the beginning of it, this new format is versionable, which means that the author can create new versions of his Libres and readers can just update them like an app. It also has a new kind of revolutionary metadata format that let’s you navigate the Libre as if it were a webpage, following links to find related Libres and documents connected to them.

&amp;#x200B;

That’s not all! I’m also developing a new kind of digital library where you can put your Libres named Libreteca. This digital library is not your usual one because you can have as many Libretecas as you like, and you can put one inside another because they are just documents which you can publish, share and download from the Internet.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m actively developing a new reading software named Hart that will let you read Libres wherever you are with any device, and also manage your Libre and Libreteca collection. I’m also working on Docuverse, a software that let’s you publish, store, acquire and access these Libres and Libretecas online, uniquely suited to the capabilities of these documents.

&amp;#x200B;

So what about writing, searching, classifying, publishing on other platforms, importing your current collection of ebooks? I have a plan for all of that, and more, as well as ideas and software at different stages of development and maturity.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to create Open Standards in which the future of literature can be built on, that’s what Libres and Libretecas are being designed for. I want to build products and services around them that will make your life as a reader and creator easier and happier, while respecting your right to choose other compatible ones by not locking you. I’m here to change things.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that this starts a very long discussion about what literature needs to become a full citizen of the Information Age and where ebooks as a technology are lacking. You can ask me anything and I will do my best to answer your questions. I'll appreciate any kind of feedback, positive or negative, as long as it's polite.

&amp;#x200B;

"Blackmail, Generic Insults And Lies : a Protonmail &amp; ProtonVPN story","Well, I've been a Protonmail user since day one, having been through the early waiting list process to test it in its beta phase, and since then I've been a vocal supporter of it all, suggesting its use to many of my friends &amp; family. More than a year ago, I decided to give ProtonVPN a try, and a few month later I subscribed to the Basic option.

I knew that my subscription was ending in January 2020, and I wanted for the next year to subscribe to ProtonVPN through my other ProtonMail address for some reasons, and thus I (pretty naively, as the story goes) was waiting for some e-mail from the ProtonMail Team to notify me about the imminent end of my subscription, as any serious business would do especially for their paying customers.

Well, as come January, I was quite surprised to receive some formally incendiary message from the ProtonMail Team, explaining that I had to pay to renew my subscription otherwise the entire content of my inbox would soon become unreachable. Clicking on the links to their FAQ which there were embedded, I was pretty shocked, so to say, to see that I (as any other one in such a situation) was treated as a ""delinquent"", which in plain English and according to the Cambridge Dictionary, defines ""a person, usually young, who behaves in a way that is illegal or not acceptable to most people"", - well, first, I am far from being ""young"", and second, the ""illegality"" of my behaviour there is pretty questionable to say the least.

I then send a pretty long email to the Protonmail team, telling them that I was a supporter of ProtonMail since the very first times of it all, then explaining my situation, how I did act in good faith as I genuinely was waiting for some heads-up on their behalf in order to renew in time my VPN subscription form another ProtonMail account, which I was still wanting to do should they agree to such a swap. The answer came the day after, merely pointing to said insulting FAQ pages and telling me again that I had to pay or my inbox would soon become unusable. Amusingly (or not), the ProtonMail operator told me in said email that indeed** ProtonMail was working on implementing a way of messaging their paying customers of their imminent end of subscription, thus somewhat aknowledging their own responsability in the whole situation**. Should I add here, for the record, that I also never was aware of the automatic renewal of said subscription, maybe given the rare obscurity of the parameters pages of the ProtonMail system.

This was on a Saturday iirc (as of today I've got no access to my inbox anymore, haha), then on Monday morning I received another ProtonMail Team's message asking me if I've received their former e-mail, adding that without any answer from me, my account would become unusable within the next few days.

Well, before I found the time to reply on that very same day (having a life besides the ProtonMail Team's enquiries), I soon realized, as I logged in later on that day in order to precisely do that (and this, in the beginning of the afternoon to be precise, so just a few hours only after said second email), that I was already locked out of my dozens of pages long, years-of-messaging worthy Protonmail inbox. So, far from ""within a FEW DAYS"", it took just HOURS for my ProtonMail many-years-old account to be taken hostage, and this in order for me to pay for a subscription that not only didn't I want to renew as such, but about which no e-mail whatsoever was ever sent by the ProtonMail Team in order to remind me of the coming end of said subscription. Well, all in all, and given the self-aknowledged responsability of the ProtonMail Team in all this mess by not sending any forms of reminder to their paying customers, I call this plain and simple blackmail.

Moral of the Story #1: Years of ProtonMail use and benevolent support, and an Inbox that gathers hundreds of messages, are valued by the ProtonMail Team at €48 (price for a 1 yr subs' for a sloppy, pretty unreliable VPN service, by the way, - yet that I was still willing to subscribe to as a way to financially support the ProtonMail's fundamentals, but that's an entire other story).

Moral of the Story #2: ProtonMail obviously prefers to lose customers (which, in this case, was willing to ssubscribe to an higher VPN account) through its shaddy behaviours than to engage in some frendly relationships with its customer base.

Moral of the Story #3: Blackmailing, Insults and Lies are the ProtonMail way to deal with their paying customers and most ancient users &amp; supporters. Which, as for me, is by now duly noted.

Moral of the Story #4: Buyer, beware.",technology,1580059230,FrenchFringe,54,1,True,2020-01-26 12:20:30

While it's not realistic to completely  eliminate paper in your office next year, 2018 could represent the  perfect time to ditch the pen and paper method and adopt electronic  signatures.

"University investigating black debate instructor who argued space isn’t real, created by whites","Space is a fiction invented by white people, who should be removed from earth. Black people should be removed from the earth – to prevent white people from colonizing other worlds.

Is this simply a freewheeling debate led by an eccentric two-time national champion-turned-instructor, or a fireable offense?

A student at Weber State University is demanding the firing of Ryan Wash, whose life story will be told in a [**Brad Pitt-financed biopic**](https://deadline.com/2017/08/debate-champion-ryan-wash-plan-b-annapurna-macro-daniel-barnz-movie-deal-1202140093/), calling him a “racist professor” who was teaching an “anti-white curriculum” to his students.

Freshman Michael Moreno secretly recorded Wash and other students during a session that a university spokesperson told *The College Fix* was “an optional, pre-season retreat” for “students interested in participating in policy debate.”

He posted [**audio**](https://youtu.be/YjvmIFrX1xQ) of the session interspersed with his own commentary on YouTube. It depicts Wash cursing at Moreno, telling Moreno that he can’t attend debate tournaments unless he parrots Wash’s arguments, and suggesting that black astronauts colluded with whites to invent space.

Facing skepticism online that Wash actually believed in what he was arguing, Moreno posted a [**video**](https://youtu.be/0fTYz50MLMM) two days later that showed clips of Wash’s previous debate performances.

He insists that Wash, the director of debate at Weber State, was not leading students in far-out debate for the sake of learning, and that the instructor had violated university policy in multiple ways.

The administration has released [**three statements**](https://www.weber.edu/WSUToday/102819_Statement.html) so far in response to Moreno’s evidence, each emphasizing that it will not jump to conclusions before finishing an investigation.

In a campuswide email Friday, the university said it has received demands from all sides asking why either Moreno or Wash hasn’t been punished yet.

“As an institution of higher education, we owe it to all members of campus to take a deliberate approach to issues like this and do our best to learn all the details involved,” it reads.

But the administration also portrayed the session led by Wash as an “exercise” where the instructor and students “explored and critiqued strategies for debating controversial issues.”

Moreno released another [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gX6Kopig_c) on Saturday, saying he is disappointed in WSU’s response and believes Wash should be fired for violation of the academic freedom policy and failure to teach his students properly.

“They continue to suggest that this was all just part of ‘teaching debate,’ even when I’ve shown more than enough evidence that that is not what happened,” he says.

Moreno (*below*) did not provide *The Fix* new information and stopped responding to queries. Wash did not respond to emails or calls from *The Fix* asking what he thought about Moreno’s videos.

-Preferably has an SSD or upgradable to SSD.

Social Media: Where have we strayed?,"I work for a new socially responsible media startup called Gides. We were born (will be born this winter technically) out of the disdain for current social media platforms for a few main pillar reasons:

1. Our privacy is consistently infringed upon
2. Our data is carelessly sold while we see NO profit
3. They are mindless, infinitely scrolling ""walled gardens""
4. Algorithms and inflexible, unformattable post types get in the way of true expression

So, we set out a few years ago to start developed of [Gides](https://www.gides.com) in stealth with 2 developers in a ill-lit Louisiana workshop, and we have received several million in funding since then. We are making it abundantly clear to our investors that we are focusing on putting the user first, protecting their privacy, and giving them a creation tool that is more powerful than the top 5 platforms combined.

We are starting a movement aligned with the values and vision of [Humane Tech](https://www.humanetech.com). If you do not know who Tristan Harris is, I urge you to check him out. Hes ""the closest thing silicon valley has to a conscience."" 

I ask you Reddit, what are your issues with Social Media, or attention-extractive technology in general? If you could create one from scratch, what would you prioritize?

You can Learn IoT by building some Amazing Projects,"The Internet of Things has become one of the most disruptive technologies in the current world. It has lead to the connection of billions of devices and has increased productivity and performance by streamlining everyday tasks across multiple business verticals. IoT promises to provide a platform that promotes efficiency, economic benefits and minimizes the human needs for daily tasks. Considering this and the potential that IoT promises in all our lives, we have planned a start to finish a one-stop learning guide on this exciting new technology. 

  
Some of the Amazing Projects you can learn.

  
**Smart alarm clock**  
An alarm clock that will not just wake people up but can also turn the bathroom light on, start playing your favorite music, open the curtains and so much more.  
**Home automation system**  
This IoT based system can allow you to control home stuff from anywhere from the world by using microcontroller, WIFI &amp; inbuilt touch sensing input pins.  
**Biometric lock**  
Learn to build a Fingerprint-based Biometric lock, one of the safest ways to lock or unlock any system as it can recognize any person uniquely and can’t be copied easily.  
**Smart baggage tracker**  
**I**t will teach you how to monitoring users’ bags with IoT based devices. It requires a tracker that will track all the bags by sending the coordinate to the users’ smartphones.  
**Weather Reporting System**  
This smart weather monitoring and reporting system can automate the whole process by monitoring humidity, temperature, rain with the help of various sensors and microcontrollers.  
**Facial Recognition Door with Raspberry PI**  
Imagine that you are standing in front of your door, and it opens automatically by recognizing your face. You will learn to create this smart door concept that will secure the gateway and ensures the right person entering your home.  
**Baby Monitoring System**  
The idea is to make you learn the concept behind the smart cradle system. It can help parents to monitor their infants from a remote place by using cry detecting mechanisms, cloud computing data, live video surveillance, and user interface.  
**Smart Anti-theft System**  
To curb the security issue, we have conceptualized this project that will teach you the smart ways to secure your home or industry from the intruders. It can monitor all the floor activity and can take pictures of the intruders.

Enter YouTube TV. Local channels, comparable quality and channel lineup. Plus all of these added bonuses:

&amp;#x200B;

Customize live channels - something I hated about PS Vue. It always showed me Fox News and Sports. Which I don't watch any of those. Now I can sort and hide channels I don't like.

&amp;#x200B;

Learns from what you watch - if I watch a lot of Food network, it is always showing me shows from that channel.

&amp;#x200B;

Can watch a show while it is recording (Roku) - Once a show started recording in PS Vue, you could not watch it simultaneously (at least some networks)

&amp;#x200B;

Can change speed of video - want to watch a show 1.25 times faster, no problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Can see thumbnail when going forward - I can see when the commercial ends!

&amp;#x200B;

More controls on the Roku (down arrow, double down arrow) - down once, see networks and more choices, down twice can see other channels, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Unlimited DVR - not unlimited but 9 months. Better than PS Vue which was pretty good already.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast fast forward (does not take long) - Roku PS Vue, skipping had a delay of a few second to resume show. YTTV is a lot faster.

&amp;#x200B;

Big bold live channel grid - not a traditional grid, but I like it a lot. Both on Roku and app.

&amp;#x200B;

Show reminders on your phones notifications - I can be reminded of my shows airing in my app.

&amp;#x200B;

Phone app has PIP - at least on Android, I can have a picture-in-picture while I do something else on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do you see any other advantages with YTTV?",technology,1572968390,kingkabra69,1,2,True,2019-11-05 10:39:50

Steam Reporting,"So basically I think my friend may have reported my account because I pmed him stuff he did not like. To give context he asked me a question about lolicons and i answered truthfully and he just did not like it. No porn involved I just explained what it was and then he called me a pedo. Additionally I tried to apologize to him for making him uncomfortable but has yet to respond. Its important to note he is still my friend.  

I also had another incident in garrys mod where a kid was trolling me and I said his real first name and where he lived in chat. BUT only because it was publicly viewable on his steam profile. As a result I don’t think that violates any rules.

Such a smart textile has huge application potential and can support people in many different ways. The garment would use haptic feedback (i.e. the use of touch to guide the user) or could serve as a discrete way of information transfer and is closely related to bodily tasks of movement and physical awareness.

How to Help Censored Users Access the Tor Network by Just Installing a Browser Addon!,"Thanks to a new Pluggable Transport called Snowflake you can now help censored users access the Tor network by just installing an addon. The way it works is pretty simple: censored users learn about a temporary proxy (a 'snowflake') from a broker (using domain fronting or other techniques) that they establish a connection with using WebRTC, the temporary proxy then transmits the requests to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network, the temporary proxy thus functions as a middle point between the censored user and the bridge &lt;=&gt; Tor network. The idea is that by getting a significantly large of ever changing and decaying temporary proxies it will be hard for a single censor to keep track and block all of them. As [David Fifield](https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/thesis/#chap:snowflake) eloquently explains,

&gt; Snowflake derives its blocking resistance from having a large number of proxies. A client may use a particular proxy for only seconds or minutes before switching to another. If the censor manages to block the IP address of one proxy, there is little harm, because many other temporary proxies are ready to take its place. 

As explained earlier, when you function as a snowflake proxy **no exit traffic is generated at your level, you just transit traffic to a bridge which then connects to the Tor network. Hence there is no need to worry about which websites the clients are accessing through your proxy. Their visible browsing IP address will match their Tor exit node, not yours.** In addition Snowflake's strength comes from having a large pool of temporary proxies, so don't forget to spread the word and have a maximum of people installing this addon!

The addon is available for Firefox on AMO:

* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/torproject-snowflake/

* (and for Android) https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/torproject-snowflake/

And if you happen to want to install it on a Chromium based browser it is available as well on the Chrome Addon Store:

* https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie

A couple of notes:

* You need WebRTC to be enabled in your browser for this to work, this is simply owing to how Snowflake works. The extension will display a warning if it detects that WebRTC isn't enabled.

* The addon tells you when a client is connecting using your proxy and how many clients you have helped circumvent censorship in the last 24h. However, right now Snowflake is only available for the **alpha** releases of the Tor Browser and then only for Linux and Mac OS, as such [there aren't currently many Snowflake users](https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-bridge-transport.html?transport=snowflake), so it shouldn't be surprising for you to pass an entire 24h without having any reported client connection.

* There are other ways to run a Snowflake proxy that are outlined [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Snowflake#HowtorunaSnowflakeproxy).

On the box of this surge protector, it says it has an electrical rating of 1800W. If I were to plug the computer into this surge protector and then plug in monitors into the surge protector as well (which I think would total to be higher than 1800W), would the whole thing just blow up in my face essentially?

Call for Contributors - Kafka-like streaming engine implemented in Rust,"Hello fellows,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm implementing a Kafka/Kinesis-like append-only commit-log streaming. My goals are to implement a streaming-engine that runs with a single binary, easy to distribute, no need for zookeeper, easy to host/operate, with pull-based API, similar to Kinesis, where the consumers are not registered and the consumers manage their own cursors, among other things.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://github.com/14-bits/voik](https://github.com/14-bits/voik)

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I have built the main parts of the commit-log, I'm trying to follow [this series](https://bravenewgeek.com/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-1-storage-mechanics/) of articles for insights on what to build first... as soon as I feel the storage mechanics is good I'll start looking into data replication and delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate contributions both to the code from a Rust perspective (I'm quite new to the language), as much as from system's perspective and such.

&amp;#x200B;

The project has a small roadmap with items that I'm working, but if people are interested in collaborating we could probably move those to more meaningful issues for discussion purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a lot of tooling/CI/documentation and community related topics that need attention, so if you feel like participating but is not an expert, it's a good place to start.",technology,1558686508,marceloboeira,1,0,True,2019-05-24 04:28:28

Am I a conspiracy theorist for being massively wary of Google Stadia? What are the potential risks of it?,"Hi all,

I'm a gamer and a few weeks ago stumbled over google stadia. 

I didn't have my hopes up too high since similar services were super expensive so I was kind of surprised how cheap Stadia will be, for the paid subscription that is...and they also offer a free model.

Now, I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I watched enough Black Mirror to find this super creepy.

I'm aware that it's almost impossible to be completely stealth when being online, but does that mean you should give away everything without hesitation?


To me, there is a massive difference between getting personalized advertisements on (which get blocked by an adblocker) after using google to search for certain keywords, than giving them more detailed info through stadia.

Hell, with deep learning AI they even could make some kind of psychological profile depending on how you play games, when you play them, how long you play them, what sort of games you play and how you ""behave"" in them, how you get rated by fellow players in case there is a commendation/ reporting system.

They can just collect so much more metrics and link them to the data they already have and I find this super creepy.

As someone that loves to play video games but has no interest to spend hundreds of dollars into hardware for either PC or consoles, honestly, stadia would be a perfect fit for me, but I just don't trust Google in this regard.


Am I hysteric and/ or just not ready for the next step into the future and maybe just not open for new tech or are there/ should there be actual valid concerns?

I'm not a tech guy, nor am I overly experienced with privacy issues but Stadia is giving me goosebumps...and not in a good way.

I would love to hear from more tech savy folks in this regard.

Tks in advance.",technology,1559982791,destiran,44,13,True,2019-06-08 04:33:11

We selected the name ""Codex"" as Leonardo da Vinci was the embodiment of the Renaissance ideal.  His “Codex"", or notebooks, are a testament to his interest in a multitude of subjects and to visionary ideas which were centuries ahead of their time.  Codex’s mission is to evoke a similar spirit of enlightenment by inspiring technology leaders and entrepreneurs to apply their collective imaginations to deliver technologies that will continue to transform our lives. Whilst the creativity of Leonardo da Vinci was captured in his notebooks, Codex shares the wisdom of today’s great innovators via Codex Talks and events. 

  
In 2019 Codex will be celebrating 500 years of Leonardo da Vinci’s legacy and the World’s Top 50 Innovators 2019 will be part of the Leonardo at 500 series of events.

  
This event is shaping up to be one of the most prestigious innovation events in recent times, so don't miss out on the opportunity to join over 1,200 CEOs and founders of the world’s most innovative companies, influential investors, and media from across the world.",technology,1564325979,chelsea_bear,0,0,True,2019-07-28 10:59:39

"Facebook account got hacked, need help","Hi guys, I don't know if this will work, but like the title say, my Facebook account has been hacked.

 Had set this account with an old phone number, that I no longer have access to. After trying pretty much every account recovery option through Facebook, I'm left with nothing in hand, because I just don't see the option to set my password using my new number or another email.

Anything I do, that includes me wanting to reset my password, fb only shows my old number and they will text a code to that particular number, but won't let me change it to my number, so I can get the code on that!

Whoever has hacked my account is clearly (REGULARLY) using it too, because I can see my notifications frequently change through out the day! P.S. I use the Chrome browser on my phone to monitor my notification activities, after getting hacked. 

So basically, this is clearly someone I know, who knows my old number (haven't used it for a couple of years), idk how they got my password, because it's just a set of random letters and numbers, that only I knew. So this person is using my number, but has changed the password, and Fb recovery isn't being helpful at all. HOW CAN I RECIEVE A TEXT ON A NUMBER I NO LONGER USE, NOR DOES IT GIVE ME AN OPTION TO CHANGE IT TO MY CURRENT NUMBER 😭😭

I would really appreciate some help on this issue because I use this account for professional reasons and the keep in touch with friends that have moved away, and wouldn't want any sensitive information getting into the wrong hands.",technology,1572115085,megalodon_fart,4,0,True,2019-10-26 14:38:05

Let's take a break and look at what is happening in the mobile industry right now.,"What we are witnessing today is a pure example of corporations pushing the vulnerable minds toward consumerism. Advertising ""12GB RAM"" - what the frick? Is this a joke? If you were to run a Linux distro on a computer that would be overkill. That is how much i use per core on a computer that i use for MOLECULAR MODELING! THAT'S INSANE!. Now lets do the math and see why this is happening and review the claims ""ecological"", ""climate-aware"" and ""waste-aware"" made by those corporations.  


How much does it cost to put a few more chips and make the consumer pay for the device more while also thinking they are getting a better deal? Close to nothing if you already have a capable manufacturing process. How much does it cost to develop your own Linux based system for phones that has a focus on what most of the developed world cares about: efficiency, cutting waste, cutting emissions and so on...? Billions (ask Apple).

&amp;#x200B;

So hey, lets just fund the green projects and do whatever we want right? This is why we need malicious companies like Samsung to quit doing this practice because they are powering this movement. Apple might look perfect to some, but their software can get CPU intensive real quick and make even the latest iPhone look like a brick in a matter of 3 phone releases. We have witnessed this before, and i don't see why it would not happen again. It is also not open sourced (for a reason obviously).  


Android does not need more than 4 GB of RAM to run properly (50% of RAM used on average, 50% free, if you are an intensive user). This is not a compromise. It seriously does not need any more RAM, it is just simply wasted for most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

So lets cut the chase. Why is this happening? Again simple. We are paying for devices that cost more a lot less so manufacturers have to rely on these malicious techniques to make profit and be innovative.

&amp;#x200B;

But that leads to the new problem: How can new companies with solutions grow if the market is crammed? This, like AI used in weapons systems, is something that will take people half a century to act upon.",technology,1563865945,dab665,6,1,True,2019-07-23 03:12:25

How to Unlock Your HTC Phone's Service Provider,"Hey guys, I just wanted to let you guys know that you can get around the &gt;$100 HTC SIM unlock codes to unlock your service provider. My HTC vive was stuck to this overpriced plan with low coverage for a while, but I discovered it's actually super easy to switch providers even if your phone is locked.

For those like me, just follow these simple steps:

1. Insert SIM card from any service provider
2. Press  \*#06# (star hash zero six hash) into your HTC phone's key pad, and write down this number (It's called the the IMEI number)
3. Go to an HTC SIM Unlocking website. The best one I found was [www.htcunlocks.com](https://www.htcunlocks.com), because they were super quick and roughly $4 cheaper than other unlocking websites. Comment if you can find it for cheaper! Enter your IMEI number, and they email you your unlock code. They say they got it from a database of codes, but I'm not 100% sure.
4. Enter that code on your device, and it unlocks instantly. Mine worked and they say about 99% of them work too, but they promise refunds if it doesn't work

Enjoy guys!",technology,1564780334,drone6251,1,2,True,2019-08-02 17:12:14

the look of androids and robotic assistants.,"so I was watching I-robot and thinking about the upcoming cyberpunk game along with the prediction that robot assistants will be a thing in the next 50-60 years and I began to wonder why people are trying to make robots look like people.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I can understand not wanting to look at a hideous monster of metal but... why make them have facial fetures like humans.  it almost feels a little weird that humans want to make a thing that is obviously NOT a human look just like a person.  

&amp;#x200B;

having robot assistants in a humanoid shape and similar size makes utilitarian sense.  we already have the infrastructure for people, so the robots could move and use the things people can use with relative ease compared to what it could be.  but I find it a little weird that society wants them to look like humans too, and have faces.  there's no utilitarian reason for a machine to have a face other than trying to talk to a human but robots don't lie or have emotions so I think words would probably be good enough for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

to be honest I think it would be way cooler for a robot to look like this: [https://alexandthecat.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/police\_robot.png](https://alexandthecat.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/police_robot.png) than looking like a human.  it might not be a problem for the next 30-50 years, but if robot assistants ever kick off it would also be nice to tell the difference between a fellow human and a robot that is someone's property, and you should be careful around so no one will sue you for accidentally bumping into it.

&amp;#x200B;

so I was wondering what other people thought about this.  should robots look like people, or should they look like what they are.",technology,1563854360,supremosjr,2,0,True,2019-07-22 23:59:20

Who is policing the web? Should I get a police report or...?,"**NOT A SINGLE WORD OF THIS IS A LIE OR AN EMBELLISHMENT...**

Lucky for me, I'm not a big internet surfer. I  rarely click on links, and don't even accept mms text messages. My limited online lifestyle has made it easy for me to narrow it down to less than 10 possible sites that may contain the culprit(s). To say that I am having major tech issues right now, across the board is a major understatement. All of my phones, even the brand-new one, have all required factory resets on multiple occasions. That said, I've lost EVERYTHING. Again, and again. They all went out the same way: a blinking, repetitive boot screen. Certain sites won't load at the most inopportune times, and my touchscreen (PC and phone) will stop working, as if I have given up control of it.

I am regularly changing my email passwords, because the login issues are non-stop. In fact, someone turned-off my two-step verification 3 days ago! Not to mention, someone logged into my Film Freeway account and changed my film project name. I could take hours making edits, formatting and adding updates, only to go back and find new typos that weren't there before, and the entire document reformatted incorrectly. Would you believe that I tried to log in to my LinkedIn account to get information for a possible job lead, only to find that the entire site comes up in  a different language? I tried going through my custom URL, the search engine and each time it would appear in a foreign language. Just for fun, they hijacked my debit card too, by cancellation a purchase transaction at the pump, cleaning me out completely. I had to wait (an unheard of) two weeks to get my money back. 

There were about 3 or 3 years I spent collecting losing lottery tickets, in order to submit them for second chance drawings. I have to have entered at least 200 tickets. Since this whole technical difficulty all started with getting locked out of Gmail, I can't help but to wonder if that's what happened. Like, did I win and someone hijacked my account? It would make sense because the state lottery has been requesting ID verification and has locked me out of my account with them as well. That reminds me, there are multiple FB and Twitter accounts under my name, but without the ""s."" I've reported the accounts as bogus, but nothing ever happens to them. Then one day, after I wrote my first book, I did a search and found a YouTube video of a teacher in Canada with my same name. Which I find odd .because I've literally been Google'ing myself every week since 2012. Outside of that video, there is no other record of her. 

I can almost live with all of that's happened, but what ruined me for the rest of my life, was when my computer got hacked and the bitlocker was activated. I wasn't even online!! I'm a writer, and I had given up everything to work full-time as a writer. I wrote 4 books, 2 shorts and 6 feature films over the course of two years, all of which may very well be irretrievable. This, is what has changed me as a person; what has destroyed my ability to trust. I don't know that I'll ever come to grips with what's happened, but I want to tell the world what's happened to me, in the event that I run into a ""freak accident"" and my work ends up on screens around the world with someone else's name on it. (Some copyright content from my 1st book is actually being aired on Netflix, without my permission if you can believe that.) I haven't even gone into my disappearing posts, books and articles--or how my follower count won't increase after receiving new followers all the time. 

WTH !?!?

I don't know if it's a single person, or an organized group but I am definitely a target. If I was rich, I wouldn't care, but I'm not. I live in my SUV with two pets, barely eating and with barely any gas in the tank. My days are spent looking for somewhere to use a decent restroom, while someone is getting rich off of my blood, sweat and tears. To me, the whole design is created as if to discredit me, or cause me to fail. Like they want me to give up and go away, so they can cash in on my work. I don't understand the inhumanity, and lack of compassion. I don't understand why, but I honestly don't care to try to understand anymore. I just want to get law enforcement involved and be done with it all so I can move on with my life. I can't be the only one this is happening to, am I?
