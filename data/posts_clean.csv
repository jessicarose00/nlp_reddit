I'm posting this. . . Well, bc the title ig. It's set to be banned apparently and deleted and I feel it's my duty to share this with whomever will see it. 

Michael Moore has created an hour and forty minute documentary highlighting the green energy movement's flaws. Now, please be aware I am as far left as can be. I believe in green energy, in renewables, and in ecological harmony. This video is just illustrating the misguided use of biofuels, the ineffectiveness of some of the renewables, how fossil fuel and logging companies regarded as some of the world's largest polluters, and de-foresters are in bed with the movements we hold close to our hearts! 

I implore you to please watch it. Form an opinion with some new content and information, share If you wish and comment per the same.

Nature's sweet resemblance of a mother portrays her selflessness towards us. But what have we done as humans? Our endless needs turned into ruthless greed has led to our cruel activities bringing about change and destruction. And now we are tasting our own medicine, trapped in, suffering from our misdeeds. 

It's not a time to regret but to realize what can be done. It's a time to act responsibly and amend our mistakes, give back what mother nature has been doing for us, for generations. A time to heal the world and restore nature at its best ensuring purity for our future.

0," **Scientists said the hole over the Arctic, noticed in March this year, has healed:** [https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2020/04/26/ozone-layer-hole-over-arctic-closes-confirm-scientists.html](https://www.theweek.in/news/sci-tech/2020/04/26/ozone-layer-hole-over-arctic-closes-confirm-scientists.html) 

The Ozone layer is a region in the Earth’s stratosphere that absorbs the sun’s ultraviolet rays, shielding the planet from the harmful radiation which can cause skin cancer. In the 1970s, scientists discovered that the ozone layer was being depleted due to man-made activities, thereby leading to a threat to life on Earth.

In March, scientists had noticed signs of a hole forming in the Ozone layer above the north pole and thought it was the result of low temperatures. It is believed to be the largest hole in the Ozone layer, and would have led to a bigger threat had it moved toward the south.

However, scientists have confirmed that the 1 million square kilometre-wide hole in the ozone layer has healed. They added that the closing of the hole was not due to the reduced levels of pollution during the coronavirus lockdown. It is believed that the polar vortex, the high-altitude currents that are responsible for bringing cold air to the polar regions, is responsible for the healing of the layer.

Long story short, I have a garbage can full of single use plastics. Also a bunch of grocery bags I've been holding on to for like several years. Wondering if anyone has actually come up with a way to make these objects useful in any way shape or form. Mainly thinking of DIY projects.Uses for single use plastics."
0,"It doesn't matter how old you are, it's time to grow up and face reality. 

Did you know most green sites have a pro business agenda? 

Did you know before covid there were 4 billion flights per year?

Did you know food shortages are weeks if not months away?

Did you know US oil exports went up 1,000% since 2010 and saved us from the 08 crash?

Did you know petrochemical has been growing 7X human population for 20 years?

Did you know that 100% renewable energy is impossible?

Did you know earth's magnetic field is weakening 5% per decade?

Did you know that ozone destroying chemicals are smuggled from China to the US and Europe every day? Do you even care?

Did you know when James Hansen proposed a carbon UBI with zero percent for governments and corporations, Bill McKibben and Bernie Sanders sponsored a bill for the feds to sequester 40% of any such dividend? Do you even understand what the fuck I'm saying?

Did you know there are thousands of studies out of Europe, the Pentagon and on PubMed saying that too much EMF saturation is bad for all plant and animal life?

Did you know that green sites care more about money than the environment?

If you said no, to any of the above questions, then what the fuck are you here?

Most ozone that protects you from the sun is right over you head, and it has never stopped depleting. This is because of refrigeration fraud. It's exactly the same as when you found ""recycling"" was a fraud.

You have no idea how much fraud is perpetrated in the name of virtue. Electric cars will have absolutely zero effect upon the climate, who ever tells you otherwise if lying.

In fact, almost everything you think you know is a lie. The US spends a trillion bucks per year on oil and war, the last thing they care about is the earth. If it doesn't make them rich, they don't care about it. Me first, earth second. The reason you don't know anything is because academic fraud has been going on for 100 years ( see links at bottom ), and guess who hates you knowing this? Academics.

The same people who brought you 911 and the opioid crisis, are the same people who are going fix it.

[No Soil &amp; Water Before 100% Renewable Energy](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/)

When Bill McKibben wanted to name 350 dot org, he kept pestering James Hansen for the number he considered safe for CO2 concentrations, Scientists don't like hard numbers, but Bill persisted so James relented. Soon after telling Bill 350, James reconsidered and restated the safe number was 300. Bill didn't care, he already printed the stationary and t-shirts.

Bill invited James to a small protest in front of the White House for a promotional photo op.w

James Hansen was promoting 100% private carbon tax dividends, where all the tax money on wealthy people would all go back to the poor. This means zero money for governments and corporations. Well guess who hates that idea? Governments and corporations, especially socialist governments.

Immediately after the photo-op, Senators Barbara Boxer and Bernie Sanders sponsored a bill that would allow the federal government to sequester ( steal ) 40% of any such dividends, effectively gutting Hansen's proposal. Bill McKibben, the Sierra Club, the WWF are all frauds who act as front men for corporations exactly the way TreeHugger works for the logging industry. Europe gets over 50% of its renewable energy burning trees imported from around the world on cargo ships. They are shipped in the form of pellets, so they can ship them cheaper. Cars in Europe burn diesel fuel and 8% of that fuel is made with palm and soy oils. Soy oil is brain toxic.

James Hansen's proposal is 10 years old and emissions went up 10%. 

We got 10 years to reduce emissions 55% or face hunger, war, thirst and runaway hothouse mass extinction. This is our last chance to do the right thing. 100% private carbon wealth tax dividends will unite the left and right against the rich and reduce emissions faster than any other way. People on the left, like Bill, have been fighting this idea for over 10 years. If you are young, your idealism is being used by NGOs and corporations against your best interest in exactly the same way Trump uses his base. Most of you are too young, stupid or pig headed to see this, which is normal.

The people who stood silently while televisions ads told you that oxy wasn't addictive, are the same people who say they'll save us from the covid. This are the same people who said that recycling plastic would save the earth, and that 911 was done by the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan.

If we don't get our shit together and speak with one voice it's over. Bernie Sanders and Trump won't fix anything. Bernie is a sell out traitor and Trump is a lying sack of shit. If Bernie is not a traitor, then why is he fighting for the Democratic Party and not you?

 Nanoparticles have been around some 10 years now, and they’re everywhere, good luck avoiding them, they are in our toothpaste, make-up, food etc., they’re even in the air, and travel straight from your nose, to your olfactory nerve, to your brain. They also get into waterways to affect fish.

*  Magnetite from air pollution gets into the brain to cause Alzheimer-like changes in our youth, in people as young as the teenage years. Magnetite is a particularly concerning pollutant because it forms destructive chemicals called reactive oxygen species, ( free radicals ) which lead to damage and inflammation. The fact that it’s also magnetic could cause interactions with external magnetic fields, which may cause further problems.

After 30 years trying, renewable energy is only 4% of total global annual energy use. 

By 2040, the IEA projects renewables to reach 14% of total global annual energy use.

Nordic Europe gets 50% of its renewable electricity by burning imported trees.

The real reason solar panels are so cheap is because China makes 80% of them.

America's F-35 fighter jet and Boeing's jets can't even fly can't because the parts are too outsourced.

Vaclav Smil is an energy expert. He states in his book, [Energy and Civilization](https://www.amazon.ca/Energy-Civilization-History-Vaclav-Smil/dp/0262035774), that energy transitions take at least 3 generations to effect. He also says there has never been a 100% energy transition. People all over the world still burn wood. The people who run reddit think politics is more important than the truth. It's not. The top 20% of income earners produce 70% of emissions. The fastest way to to reduce emissions, fight inequity and to unite the left and right, is to tax the rich and give 100% of it back to the poor, without letting governments and corporations get their greedy little mitts on it. Socialists and corporation both hate that idea. That's why corporations will pay green NGOs and their media outlets to slander and shame Moore and Zehner.

If we don't reduce emissions 55% in 10 years, we die. So does everything else on earth because when ocean acidification goes supernova, plankton will cease producing enough oxygen for most animals to live. If you want to believe that Democrats are less evil than Republicans, you go right ahead. This post isn't for you. This post is for people who think.

All the so-called green NGOs are fronts for corporations. The recycling program was a front for giant petrochemical companies. The guy from Greenpeace Europe used to fly to work everyday. If he stopped it was because he got caught, not because he gave a fuck. Being smart doesn't immunise you against stupidity. Stop calling corruption stupidity. Stop being an ideologue. It will take global socialism 50 years to get 8 billion people to do anything. We do not have 50 years. We got 5.

10,000 years ago, humans and livestock were 0.03% of land vertebrate biomass.

Today, humans and livestock are 96% of land vertebrate biomass.

Today there are 25 billion chickens on earth.

Humans and livestock caused 80% of species extinctions.

400 years ago there were more sea turtles in the Caribbean by weight than buffalo on the plains.

200 years ago Passenger Pigeon migrations would block out the noonday sun.

After 30 years trying, renewable energy is only 4% of total global energy use.

This is because electricity production is only 20% of total global energy use.

By 2040, the IEA projects only 14% of total global energy use will be renewable.

Nordic Europe gets 50% of its renewable electricity by burning imported trees.

Vaclav Smil says there has never been a 100% energy transition and they at least 75 years to do.

Peter McKay said that South Korea doesn't have enough land for 100% renewable energy.

i am by no means an expert, but it just seems like since the 1800s humanity has taken literally oceans worth of carbon out of the ground and put it into the air... I’m all for renewable energy, but solar panels/win turbines/etc don’t remove what’s already in the atmosphere.

Green energy is only 4% of global total energy use after 30 years trying.

It will reach 14% of global total energy use by 2040.

Ir we don't reduce emissions 55% in 10 years, runaway hothouse mass extinction becomes impossible to reverse or stop. 

Only 4% of land animals are wild, 96% are human and livestock by weight.

The 4% we do have will be reduced to 2% within 20 years.

The ocean heating is threatening mass extinction and collapse in 10 years.

The trees are facing degradation and collapse from too much drought and heat in 10 years.

So will the tropics and food baskets will face 2 C twenty years ahead of global average.

This is not politics, this is the survival of life on earth.

The scope, speed, breadth, depth, height and sheer volume of the energy we put into earth's destruction is ten times faster than when the asteroid hit earth 60 million years ago.

Everybody on earth, except for educated media elite consumers knows we're fucked.

The left eats its own, and so does the right, that's why we always end up with nothing.

Both sides lie because it's cheaper, quicker and easier.

We are supposed to give birth control to all women, not sterilise all men.

By 2050 most men will be sterile. Sooner than expected, and worse than expected, as always.

There will be no more kids because ecosystems and the climate don't care what we think.

There will be no socialist utopia because 5 billion people don't care.

The earth won't be fine without us.

There is a gross excess of oil. Right now tankers are filling up and there are soon going to be no more tankers and no more space to place the oil. Oil wells are very expensive and dangerous to turn off. They are all still pumping. No one is using that much oil right now. In 2 weeks all reserves will be filled. 

No one has talked about where it will go, and, I fear it will be dumped. Please email your congressman/senator asking what the plan is for when these companies run out of room. They cannot be allowed to dump this and say they had no choice.

 You can never fully clean the environment that has had a spill. You can never bring back the life lost on the ecosystem. I want to get this brought to mainstream media before it is too late. Please discuss this with your friends and look for opportunities for creating awareness. I want our ocean life and anywhere else to stay free from oil contamination.Stop the coming oil spill!"

In the last 10,000 years, humans and livestock have destroyed 98% of land vertebrate species biomass. Our green crop fields are so poisonous, they kill all birds, fish, frogs and insects that come within miles of them. There are so many poisons in the biosphere that all vertebrate species are rendered biologically emasculated, feminized and infertilized.

Mass extinction is preceding runaway hothouse chaos. Within this century our oceans will become super saturated with carbon and destroy most of the plankton on earth. In other words, earth won't be fine without us.

Their work is grounded in local knowledge and the promotion of women's participation. In May, they will be running an online course called *The Courage to Shine*. 

*The Courage to Shine* was first created in 2018 by Clare Dubois, TreeSisters founder, as an experiment in liberating women’s energy on behalf of life. Clare had been looking more and more deeply at the resistance to action around climate change, and also the feminine shadow when it comes to being visible or taking action in the world. In response to this she created a set of tools for inner alchemy that resulted in a powerful and potent 21 day immersive virtual course.

If you would like to learn more, you can access the recording of the free introductory call that took place on April 27th [here](https://treesisters.org/grow-yourself/courses/the-courage-to-shine). What I love about this program is that there are three pricing options, so that you can choose the price that fits your budget. AND your payment supports the planting of 60-120 trees - together, we will be planting our own forest!

0,"It is happening. Everywhere I look I see new interesting initiatives in all areas of life. Whether it is to create ecological buildings, regenerative agriculture, natural bee farming, holistic medicine, or collaborations of free information. It is all out there wherever I look and it brings me great joy.

In times of great struggle, people are forced to question their old habits and assumptions. To cast away what is not serving us and venture for new solutions. Slowly we are waking up and opening up our eyes, washing away the sleepiness that has been fogging out minds for so long.

The old world is crumbling in front of us, but still so many cling to a distant dream of a good and easy life and with vague hopes of ample rewards. Most of us have still not breached the barrier and are stuck in the make-believe reality of the modern control society, working on its last gear to push forward its futile plan of world domination.

I predict a coming clash of beliefs where the old meets the new in a head to head confrontation. This is the next phase, and this will determine the future of generations to come. Now we need to step up to the challenge and do the one thing that the world has been crying out for since the birth of man. To unite all men and women in a global alliance for peace and freedom.

This is a crash course in military strategy, as we are in a war of thought that needs to be won by outsmarting the manipulators in their own game. Some see it, and many do not. The master plan is a plan of smokes and mirrors. Giving us false hopes, leading people away from each other, and into false doctrines.

But we do not need to fall in their traps and we do not need to answer to their false calls. We need not worry about what is true or false in a world of never-ending lies and false news bombarding us not only from the media but also from insurgents placed in all positions imaginable. We have a plan and with the guidance of higher powers, we will succeed.

This is my lesson of life and the grand strategy: First: Assume that every and all people you will ever see is an infiltrator with the sole purpose to lead you astray. This is all people, with no exception. Secondly: Act as if every person you meet is your friend and join them in a common venture for world peace and harmony. This will instantly take away the effect of the evil dialectic tactics of divide and conquer and take away their greatest weapon in a flick of an eye.

But listen carefully. We shall never fall for the trick to follow anyone. Be it government and politicians or charismatic individuals and non-governmental organizations, as this is the way of the old. We shall join their causes as long as they sound good on the surface, but we shall not accept their roadmaps, which certainly will lead us back where we started, if not by design, then by dark plots of corruption and blackmail.

This is what we will do: We will organize ourselves wherever we are and whatever we do. Organize in a natural way that creates a network of networks outside of any old organizational structure. We will connect together, we the people, and create a unity that will bridge everything and interconnect everyone. This holy union will open up even the darkest plot and transform it into a vehicle of our liberation.

We will join together in a fractal system of organization. The only way that organic life actually organizes itself in nature. Not from the top of the pyramid and down, but rather from the roots and up. Starting by creating a small circle of 6 people each we then connect 6 circles into a cluster, we connect 6 clusters to a supercluster. And so goes the story on until the earth is aligned and we can with a common voice take over all the structures that we are a part of and use them to create our dreams.

We will use the force of the enemy against themselves and pretend not to see their lies. Using their false promises to further our own agenda, to use their resources, and recruit their members for our own purpose. The plan is set and the clock is ticking. The divine plan has a set time. On the 22 of February, in the year 2022 we will join in an epic celebration of life. On that day we will join together on the streets worldwide and we will declare the opening of the world fractal democracy.

This will create what the elite always wanted to do, but with no strings attached. Their plan is our plan, but with the people as the leaders, we will create full transparency in all governmental activities and be the new global policymaker that will bring us into the future.

So step up and listen to your heart. You are the start of this. You are the seed that will give power to the growth of our moment. This is my calling for you. All men and women of age. Your time has come and you know what to do. Find your circle and share your dream. Prepare for the day to come. And on that day you will know what to do. This is the chance of a lifetime. Now it is up to you.

0,"As we draw closer to the 2020 presidential election, I think its important for people to know about an alternative to the unprogressive, uninspired and status quo policies of the two major political parties. 

The Green Party is a small, independent party that cares immensely for issues such as equality between all, workers rights, and of course environmental issues. Their most popular candidate, [Howie Hawkins](https://howiehawkins.us), also has the support of other smaller independent parties such as The Socialist Party USA and seeks Left Unity as an admirable goal. 

Now, for the reality of voting green. Their chances of winning in THIS election are slim at best. I understand how someone looking at Trump’s 4-year stint as idiot-in-charge can make many people see Biden as an angel in comparison. However, when I look at Bidens policies and history as a politician through an objective lens I see many things I dislike, warmongering in Iraq, denial of Gay Marriage Act, Glass Steagall repeal in 1999, and most recently telling a climate activist in Iowa “go vote for another candidate” when asked about environmental policies. When I look at this candidate I don’t feel proud at the thought of voting him into office.

Voting Green isn’t a bid to kick trump out this election, its a bid for the future of the United States. If The Green Party gets 5% of the popular vote they get recognized as a major political party and receive federal funding ($8-10 million dollars). This would allow for MUCH better campaigning and organization for a party that I know myself, and people who care about environmental and egalitarian issues would be proud of.

So it turns out somebody has poisoned our hive, most certainly not deliberately however its likely they either sprayed something on the bees or have put out poisoned bait and the bees have brought it back to the hive.

The queen is still alive though barely however all the larvae are dead and so are half the workers, its coming into winter so the hive is pretty much a goner.

Sadly we are in a rather suburbanite area so we have a lot of neighbors. Please people, if you see a lot of bees in your back yard, do not assume you have an infestation and then poison them.

0,"Most of the things I've read on this topic indicate that it might be too good to be true. It is touted as a potential savior of humanity. I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but I would like to consider more of the negative consequences this would pose to the Earth to have a more realistic view of the impacts.

For example, if we mined water, would that get to the point where we were artificially supporting the Earth's population, and any disruption would be catastrophic?

Does it just further the idea of exploitable resources for profit and all the nastiness that comes along with it?

If you bring one particular type of matter to the Earth in large enough quantities (mining scale), would it have a negative impact on planetary cycles?

Are there any other potentially negative impacts that don't get discussed often in articles and rosy sci-fi?

I'm very curious to hear thoughts and ideas. Thank you!What would be some negative environmental consequences to the Earth as a result of asteroid mining?"
0,"If we don’t make some serious changes, the effects of climate change will be catastrophic and millions of people will die. Meanwhile, everyone will look at the past with hindsight bias wondering what we could have done differently, when the facts have been in front of us the whole time. We cannot spend more money bailing out the fossil fuel industry right now. We need to invest in renewables. We are running out of time.In 15 years we will be in a similar situation we are in now but with climate change."

We're a climate startup that's exploring ideas around sustainability and environmental spending, and how to enable anyone and everyone to participate in understanding and reducing environmental impact! We were fortunate enough to partner with one of the world's largest bank's innovation lab, so we have a chance at reaching millions of people to drive REAL CLIMATE ACTION!

We’re exploring a number of different concepts, such as providing customers with a full view of their carbon footprint based on their spending, or directing money to support green brands. Ultimately, we’re looking to help people make more informed choices about what they buy and where they shop, and how they can live more sustainably! We're looking for feedback on these early ideas as we flush them out, to see what people would want to see in a product like this. Any and all feedback is welcome!

0,"Dear Earth,

I peered out and you flooded through

At first too bright for me to see
[my website](morris.kishk@gmail.com)
I shut my eyes, scared

But hooked

What lay out there, just beyond my gaze?

What troubles. It would better to stay safe and warm and held

But what wonders. What majesty. What adventure

I ventured out, slow at first until you were all that I saw

You were beautiful, your colors, 

 Your vistas, plains, mountains, valleys, rivers and seas

 Filled with sustenance too, the source of all life

 I pranced around in your fields, splashed your waters in my face, giggled and plunged in

  

But you were powerful too. Too Powerful

 I always could see that. 

 I was always a step away from being lost in your vastness

 They told me that too. With their walls, and their clothes 

 protections they built to keep you at bay

 Every night they’d wrap me in an extra layer, as if to say, “armor yourself child and you’ll be safe”

 

And then you struck

Actually, you were always striking, from the beginning

Sometimes gently 

Like, remember that time I cut my knee on your jagged shell and red stuff dripped out of me

 Or that time that thorn dug itself into my side. That bee bit me and it stung for days. That time that wolf ate Charley. And he was the only boy in town who was nice to me.

Other times more violently.

Like what about that whole tribe that was swallowed up one day by your uprising. Them and everything they built too. 

Father told us all about it.

He said it was cause they were bad, but I wasn’t really sure.

You took Reuben and he was kind. One wrong turn in a long journey and your sun turned him into a prune.

We found his body two days later shriveled up, worms crawling out of his orifices

And you took so many more of my brothers 

washed away

frozen by your bite

ravaged by your winds 

and devoured by your other children- those mutts that prowled the land, hungry. 

Were you and I enemies?

Could I take up arms against she who birthed me? 

Did I have any other choice?

You were to submit. I’d make you.

And I did.

And it was also good for you. I’d make you more beautiful. Work your fields. We could be partners.

Ok sure, sometimes I’d work you too hard.

I’d eat from your tree until there was nothing left. Chop it down and torch it to keep myself warm. Plunder your depths. You had so much to give. It couldn’t hurt you. 

And also, I had children to feed. A rapidly growing little gang. They were so cute. Could I let them go hungry? 

 

O, the guilt. My sin is is too much to bare. 

 You struck first. I saw it with my own two eyes. You killed them. Swallowed them up. My brothers. And you would do it to the rest of us if we didn’t protect ourselves.

And I do love you. I always have. Since the moment you first shined on me.

I still play with you and roll in your grass 

and dance on your waves

and tie a string to a kite and watch you bounce her around so delicately.

And what can I do anyways? It’s them.

They’re greedy. I’d make them to stop if I could.

Unless it meant I’d be hungry, or cold, or dead.

Because you would do that. The second I dropped my guard.

So yea. Earth. It’s been a good one.

The first partnership I have ever known. 

The one who birthed me, loved me, and nurtures me to this day. 

The source of all of my inspiration.

The source of it all.

I do love you 

Always have.

Always will.Earth Day Poem"

0,"Hello friends,

Truly excited to tell you that after months and months of hard work, our team has released Treeapp ( [https://www.thetreeapp.org/](https://www.thetreeapp.org/) ), the first app to plant a tree for free everyday - from a few taps on your phone! 

How does it work?  


Every day, you can plant a tree for free. Open the app, choose where you want your tree to be planted (in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania), and get your tree funded by discovering products &amp; services from our business partners. We look to promote companies with sustainable products and services.  


We've partnered with international NGO's to plant these trees where they are needed the most, recreating the habitats of wild animals and hiring local communities to plant these trees.  


Our goal is to reach 1 million trees planted every day in 2022! Join us :))    (and looking forward to your comments on what we could improve on!)

Feel free to skip my ramble to the prompt: 
[My name is Kody, I’m 21 years old, my whole life I’ve had severe depression and as of last month I realized I have adhd. 
I’m on new medication but that’s not what this is...
I’ve created a concept idea for a non profit company that helps the world. 
I genuinely just want everyone to be happy, no one deserves what I’ve seen. 

So here’s the draft / all notes I’ve managed to force myself to write. 

(I don’t care if I’m not the one to do the company. 
Humanity deserves better though. Wether I see it or not. )
(I also have never felt supported, or as if anyone even wants change, and I can almost guarantee this is only going to get at the most 10 up votes if not in the negatives)]

Everything company non profit draft 

Ec, Needs
State of the art technology list
Perfectly designed housing 
With the goal to provide and take care of everything. The company is a non-prophet funded at start by a generous investor who shares the vision. 
Create a team each with their own role. Start going for government funding. Have 20 architects work with ecologist and leading engineers from multiple companies. Design perfect buildings soundproof best and latest tech, smart fridge garbage chute in the wall. All residents have, all to basement where it is collected and sorted with ai in basement. Everything recycled properly. Make it green building.
Pitch: Everything company where everyone can have everything. Have you struggled with rent in the past and as a result worked with multiple jobs. Always focussed on work to pay the mortgage. To pay for food. Wanting to go to university for your dream job but worries of money to stop you. Do you find yourself in a cycle? And would you like to change it? What if you could live in a facility with the commodities of a home. Luxury of an apartment. And all services provided. Go down to the service desk sign out one of the vehicles or register for a training day out with someone who has devoted their worktime to teaching. 
Everyone in the community that lives here enters residency through a contract, some give us their mortgage some with no debt and positive in the bank when entering we will figure is the record all of this for your benefits and never in the negative format. We have in each building a cafeteria with food provided for meals, confirm on your fridge if you plan to come down. Cook in your own kitchen go down to the grocery store or anything you want you can buy with your residence card. Buying in this case refers to inventory management want something brought in for you, just requested. We provide everything and in return you work on yourself or with the community we have our own hospital that partners with Universities to provide the best education and care of patients, unlike current healthcare we aim to connect physiological dentistry imagery psychology and all other branches of healthcare. 
All located within convenient locations around the Community less hours on healthcare workers. Broader percentage of people being helped as all of these are free. Less stress and demand as well as these people are your neighbour now. Why unless it was a rough day with patients or staff have hostility.
People that like to garden can get their own little plot of land to do as they please and while they are at work. Gardeners who devote to it can tend to it.
Business professions this illuminates the need for competition, example: competing over clients because now if you choose to live at our facility. We will outsource/work contract meaning we will go to your job and offered to partner with them to keep you on as an employee. Payroll is directed to me and you can just focus on the best for yourself the business and our company. If the employer agrees our job service department branches with them offering direct help and sometimes even funding to the business you work for to improve work conditions and quality of life for you and those around you, Regardless of if they are with the company or not. However if our job service department can’t come to an arrangement which should theoretically never happen. We would ask as in the contract that you resign and we find nearly any job in the open community or within the company that you will enjoy and be happy with.

Unifying healthcare with the workforce, and bringing everyone together as a team. Taking money out of the equation of society so it can perform properly and to the highest standard. I suggest an organization nonprofit called everything company that has designed utopia like facilities with state of the art features constantly growing and changing to fit our residencies needs. The company offers residency to above 95% of the population into those who we can’t provide for, we still to the best of our ability try to provide an offer services to those in need. We offer residency through a contract agreeing to work/school/help/etc. mechanics can work in their department part of the facility (multiple through each city) All vehicles we provide or looked at and worked on every day. Each resident can sign out a vehicle and take a trip anywhere. Go to the activity registration desk and sign up for lessons skydiving, and learn from someone who has made this a workday out of their passion. for Helping others experience the activity. Trying to do everything to find motivation or what interests you. Go to school for what you love no worries of that as long as in some form you work or help the organization and done with education. Have classmates and teacher who care about what they choose. Teens exiting high school shall receive their own apartment once of age with a special contract giving extra gap time to help each individual find their place in society. This special contract gives them time and choice to decide if the organization is right for them. If however you do choose to leave. We will help job searching/apartments hunting and whatever you choose. Hopefully the children that were born into the organization see we only try to benefit their growth and less towards resentment. Regardless they are given choices and awareness towards life. In the gap time we offer you to shadow/Trai jobs and to help save in case you choose to leave.

Fixing plastic now that every service is free and residents no longer have to worry about money. We can direct the funds to finding immediate solutions to these problems well expanding. Otherwise it’s private companies hiding research process for profit even though an organization like this could create kelp/hemp/algae just has a few examples from start to while pushing public research for humanities problems
-What to do with the world. Everything company. That’s the statistics starting with plastic waste how hot the earth is get all the stats of it.
Problems currently in the world: extinction of millions of species, starvation/water. Waste. Oceans filled with plastic, low fish due to plastic. And yet plastic is still being produced trash equals no idea how to fix. Atmosphere car pollution everything else.
Why can’t the individual tackle these. They have to work to survive they have to focus on survival rather than growth of the south survival of the species.
Why doesn’t governments. 
Separation/distraction/focuses on current survival of one rather than collective group of individuals. Did you know banks print digital money through an imaginary process of interest often with no purpose but survival and it is all designed to distract away from growth by adding fillers and forcing ideas etc. Orson needs and desires through advertising and marketing. Why do we work and would you work for free and doing what you love if you no longer had to worry about you and your families survival giving you time and resources to pursue passions and dreams

What you need: Plans for housing units minimum 220' x220' being multiple stories (10-15-20 stories) with observation deck, public restrooms, cafeteria, separate building for services and access to psychological treatment or psycho therapy, housing units will need to be honestly - perfect units with multiple options. Single rooms doubles family special needs etc, in order to hopefully minimalize ""greed"".
In addition as the company expands after the foundation is set; hundreds of architects that work with the company, can work to design perfect buildings that meet everyone’s needs and desires, as well as interior decorating and all that

Trash compactors, Recycling shoot, Garb orator, The absolute best shower and toilets. YOU have ONE chance at this don’t fuck it up cause people will be using this for years to come hopefully, no stress, low energy use, minimalize pollution, hopefully all trash is collected by garbage shoots having perhaps a separate for toxic etc? auto sort and have recycling solutions and trash collection in place, low flow toilets, windows that absorb energy as well as can perhaps be tinted to save the energy needed to cool building, fridge that has calendar connected to company and can tell you everything you can make and rough time of expire helping plan meals for the whole family or being able to check if you are confirming to be at the cafeteria tonight for dinner service breakfast lunch etc. So they have a rough estimate. Recollection of water? Auto filtration system, keep in mind I don't intend to do this for just the white world I want the same engineers contractors to be able to go around the world and build the same design perfectly, have storage into walls make space of everything. 
You want a perfect design so that people will be comfortably living in them for their lives or until they are ready to move. No problems = Nothing to complain about
Connect all services for easy access build a new design of roads able to absorb some amount of electricity even if its miniscule, is their ways to discharge it into vehicles driving on it, can you use the kinetic energy if no normal cars were on the road and reinvent roads to be like wall E, using magnetism to spin wheels and push car forward, water drainage, what happens if there is a problem with one segment of road, 
---
100% of income earned goes to the compounds collective interest and/or reinvestment.
universal basic income and allowances, you have a compound card to scan at the grocery store to track your purchases and make healthy suggestions meal suggestions all things in grocery store are plastic free solutions, the reason for cards is if we can track averages then we can find the right amount without waste etc, 
　
Pick an area to start, (for this concept I'm going to just keep it simple to myself).
Buy as much land as you possibly can in said area
Have a team of architects and engineers 
------------------------
You get a job where you feel fulfilled and enjoy it, with the goal being it is the job of your dreams, while having a free education, free apartment in the ""compound"" (foundation/the businesses/government run buildings where everything is provided) (Singapore) free groceries, free social services connections to counseling phsyio therapy rehabilitation centers, we have a care home where comfort is actually the priority, specialized connected community dealing with dementia and associated diseases. Where your doctors can walk over and check to see how they are doing and consistently monitor behaviours to ensure the best level of comfort and treatment.

But as shitty as the world is maybe everyone can make it all better, i propose an organization, with goals of:
Housing, Job services/placement, health care, education, waste management/control. Free services for your enjoyment. 
Goals of providing each person with a fuffiled life, engaged in what you choose.
Help us help you.
Betterment of mankind, technological advancements, uniting the species and understanding our peace.
Eliminating the need for greed so someone can finally do something about the problems in the world.

Why hasn't this beendone already, what will it take for a billionaire or a parent company or government. To step in and quickly fix the planet before it is to late, if its not to late already.
I truly cant see any other step for humanity as a species than to work as a team. all the organisms in your body can do it, so why cant we ? 
A drop of bad water in the ocean doesn't need to ruin the whole ocean.
　
Outro
Again at the time of writing this am only an average normal twenty year old, with dreams of making the world better, yet little hope. But I literally gave the answers. A lifeguard can only help someone willing to be helped or he/she will drown as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Imagine all companies and studios having the choice to partner with organization and have increased resources while eliminating the required need for money, for workers to work, or consumers to enjoy it?
Potentially getting : Disney, Sony, Netflix, 
Microsoft, Google, Bing, 
　
Disney and Sony can now have al consumers vote (if they choose) on polls to settle disputes and they can share a movie universe each providing towards the enjoyment of others rather than focusing on profits. And those who can only focus on profits will be phased out or forced to find other purpose in life.
Imagine if all these companies shared information under one roof. How fast would humanity improve? Buddy at google ends up coming up with 49% solution to the worlds problems for computers but has it patented, if only he can work with the other person at Microsoft with the counterpart 49%. Now that they can publicly share this the pubic ends up providing the last 2% and we are all the better for it?
------------------------------------------　
Millions of people majority of them being senior; Live in assisted living where __________--
　
Pay up the ass and cant focus on entertaining/bettering themselves, but rather surviving pension paycheck to paycheck unable to truly do what they wish. Instead the organization provide as a larger more developed model.
Where people can socialize so much more, from 40 to 400 a building and a plethora of engage able activities.
Dementia care could be designed in a near city like enclosed area again connected to facility.
complex care could be managed beside hospital units, large areas where workers get assistance they need, and enjoy coming to work to care and not be overworked. They can report any and all issues with promise of follow up, and continuum of choices for reporting issues.
The universities/science branches/ health care/research now can be added to everyday settings and have private care taken away, with focus being on individual self and mankind.
Adding to everyday settings provides growth and opportunity to be shared and taught upon.
As a health care aide, I see medicines that do twenty things being used to treat one effect/result in a patient, It needs more accurate research.
Doctors are overworked because they are understaffed because it isn't worth being trapped in debt over. If we take away these worries and everyone can work in a manner they like. Society should theoretically function properly.

""What to do with the world.""
Everything company
stats 
problems currently in the world: 
extinction of millions of species
starvation/ dying of thirst
waste
ocean filled with plastic low fish plastic is still being produced 
trash = no idea how to fix? bullshit its uniting so we can actually do algae farms, mass collection of waste, sorting and reusing materials, 
atmosphere, car pollution
and everything else.
　
- Why cant the individual tackle these. We work so we can survive in this day and age, we focus so much on our momentary survival. Rather than growth of self and our future, or the survival of the species. Care for the earth, what impact does each of our actions have on everything around us.
- Why doesn't government do something to help the people so they aren't stuck in a cycle of survival. Instead the focus is on separation of the people, distraction, focusses on current survival of one rather than collective group or individuals.
Did you know banks have technically printed more money than any other government, although its not physical money quite like what we were used to, the gold standard per dollar. But rather through ""debt"" a fairly new concept in terms of banking especially when going passed the government to add additional value to that being borrowed, creating and endless cycle of only 100billion cash circulation, 20 trillion in all digital platforms of banks, and then the debt adds that rack up to 40 trillion being owed. No matter how people try to pay it back, inevitably their only option is to be defensive, countries lead to war over this, tensions over china. 20tril owed to them, yet they don't ask for it back.
The whole political system is all designed to distract away from these things, it forces us to be cogs in a machine and not really make an impact unless we stop working. Where as I see a new system of growth and betterment of mankind, uniting countries over time. Endless possibilities.
Forcing the idea of ""needs"" upon people in society. Having to work for needs is wrong in so many regards. Should a king not provide for his people? Why do we work? And would you work for free doing what you love? If you no longer had to worry about you and your families survival, what would you seek in life.
Giving you time and resources to peruse passions and dreams; while unifying healthcare with workforce and bringing everyone together as a team. Taking money out of the equation or keeping a universal basic income regardless it can all be sorted after.
I suggest an organization non profit called everything company tat has designed utopia like facilities wit state of the art features, constantly growing and changing to fit our residencies needs.
The company offers residency to above 95% of population. And to those we cant provide for, we still offer services as best as we can.
E C: offers residency through a contract; agreeing to work/school/bettering yourself/getting help/treatment/care of others/ etc.
-
Fixing plastic, now that every service is free and residents no longer have to worry about money and budgeting, we can direct funds to finding immediate and temporary solutions to these epidemics that fill the world today, while expanding globally to assist everyone in the world that is willing. Otherwise its private companies hiding research for profit even to an organization like this could create kelp/hemp/algae farms to start while pushing public research for humanities problems.
　
Mechanics can work in their department (section/ part of the facility).All vehicles we provide are looked at and worked on everyday. Each resident can sign out a vehicle and take a trip anywhere they choose, as if they were in their own home. With the added benefit of optional automatic driving, everyday maintenance, a car suited to whatever activity (almost) always available.
Go to activity registration desk and sign up for lessons skydiving, and learn from someone who has made this a work day out of their passion for the activity and helping others experience it. Try and do everything to find motivation or what interest you.
Go to school for what you love. No worries of debt as long as in some form you work or help the organization when done with education. Have classmates and teachers who care about what they are in. Focusing on self growth rather than gain.
　
Teens exiting high school shall receive their own apt once of age with (three different options) a special contract giving gap time to help each individual find their place in society. This special contract gives them time and choice to decide if the organization is right for them. 
If however you do choose to leave. We will help with job searching, apartment hunting, and whatever else you choose.
Hopefully the children that were born into the organization see we only try to benefit their growth and less towards resentment. Regardless they are given choices and the awareness towards life. In the gap time we offer you to shadow, try jobs, and to help you save in case you choose to leave.Can anyone finish this? Very rough draft for world peace: ✌️"

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

After dealing with over a month of quarantine, a week long stay-at-home period would be easy, not to mention the economic effects wouldnt be nearly as drastic, especially if it became a standard practice and perhaps we receive some sort of small financial relief to compensate.

How true is that really? 


It's also been on my mind since last year, when I was working on a project that detailed fish species in a certain area, and the conservation status of just about literally every single one (out of hundreds) was ""no concern"" - I think I got like... 2 threatened ones and 1 endangered one.  I can't remember examples but there were species where I was *very* certain they were infact endangered. 


This is like... fucking Ministry of Truth control the public narrative crap. They don't want people actually knowing if a species is endangered anymore because, I guess, it's all going to crap anyways and everything's gonna be extinct in 50-100 years *so why try*? Might as well keep people blissfully happy while you can, huh? As long as stomachs are full and the air is still mildly breathable nobody should have to think about the world's biosphere falling apart now should they? 


You know, over the years I've really mellowed out, you know. I've really kind of learned that everything just sucks I just gotta sit down and eat my shit sandwich. But this gets to me. My god this shit pisses me off. Where's the outrage? Huh? For anything? Not just this. I don't get it. All the outrage is over shit that does. not. matter.  It's all stuff like gender politics or what some Hollywood asshole did or some bullshit Trump tweeted or how some videogame isn't inclusive enough. Everything that *actually* fucking matters is either not reported on at all or is bulldozed over in .02 microseconds.So if species that actually ARE endangered aren't listed as such anymore, how am I (and other people) supposed to know what needs help?"

Everything you know is 100 years old. Private banks took over public credit and currency 100 years ago in 1913. Socialism and feminism started. Socialism is not a requirement of free education and healthcare. The best way to fight climate change is a UBI based on taxing the wealthy.

UBI = 100% private carbon wealth tax dividends = 100% to you = 0% to gov and corp

0,"The TapeCoat factory, in Evanston IL, produces asphalt tape, using coal tar pitch applied to a cotton backing, and has been operating in our neighborhood for over a decade.  Coal tar pitch has been linked to various cancers and other serious health conditions. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when residents of Illinois have been ordered to shelter in place, TapeCoat continues to unapologetically subject residents to their emissions.

We are subjected to the noxious smell of burning tar, rubber, and asphalt at all times of the day. Depending on how the wind blows, the smell is extremely intense to the point residents have to cover their noses and mouths to leave their homes. Residents are waking up with headaches on a daily basis and, at times, a mysterious metallic bad taste in their mouth. Neighbors have experienced mysterious illnesses, such as lung cancer, lesions, and respiratory issues. We are concerned to let our kids play in the backyard or the neighborhood park, kitty-corner from Tapecoat. The common denominator of these concerns is TapeCoat, owned by Chase Corp (NYSE: CCF) which is headquartered in Westwood, MA.

While the effects of this process have been a concern for years, we have decided to shine a light on the potential impact of their emissions, in hopes of finally coming to a resolution. The main concern is the emission of asphalt fumes from the coating process. The residents want an answer to when this will end. Delaying this process on Tapecoat’s end is only prolonging the suffering of the residents. 

We are a diverse community - homes filled with families who have spent generations in Evanston, those who have recently moved here with young kids, and every point in between. We are a welcoming community that thrives on being good neighbors, and since our neighborhood is suffering from the actions of your company, we are organizing together.  As a neighborhood, we will:

&amp;#x200B;

* organize the entire Evanston community to attend City Councils meetings to address      their concerns until this is resolved,
* continue to collect data from neighbors on the time, dates and intensity of offensive, and potentially harmful, odors in the air,
* expand the scope of our data collection to include any health impacts that may have been caused by these emissions,
* continue to work with the City of Evanston (IL), the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, and the Illinois Attorney General’s office to supply this data for their review, and recommend enforcement of IEPA’s Notice of Violation that TapeCoat recieved in Nov 2019, and
* engage with various community and environmental protection groups to bring this issue further into the public’s view.

For Chase Corp, TapeCoat may simply be a source of revenue, but for our neighborhood, it is about the health of our kids, parents, and grandparents, who breathe in the after effects of those revenues.  We appreciate having a partnership with businesses in our neighborhood, but not at the expense of our health. 

Sincerely,

“Yep, in a landfill”, he interrupted. 
I couldn’t believe it. How many times have I bought a lot of completely UNNECESSARY items, like hangers, only to find that they can’t be recycled? Too many. 
Now, all I can think of is how much I’ve personally contributed to one of the largest and fastest growing ecological disasters on earth. 

Did you know that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish?! You and I... we’re ALL responsible for THIS TRAGIC FACT.... 
I don’t toss trash into the ocean, actually quite the opposite, but nobody NEEDS HANGERS. 
We can all fold our clothes, and iron them later. Now, the only home we all share, faces an ecological crisis with no simple solution.

but what? 

Aside from launching hazardous waste into outer space, which currently, is not optional, too expensive and not worth the risk..

0,"Hi everyone! I have started a growing organization Start With You, which aims to decrease our adverse ecological impact on the environment. This is something that can be pursued from the comfort of your home amidst quarantines all over the world. 


Our functioning will be in a chapter-wise fashion where each chapter founder (wherever in the world they may be) forms a core team locally. The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization’s executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.

You are welcome to initiate a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.


If not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-


1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. 

2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. 

3. Artists, musicians, singers, poets, dancers, anyone with a creative streak who would like to express and promote the cause of environmental sustainability through art forms!

Even if you have not read the text, your response will be greatly appreciated

The excerpt is from Latour’s “Facing Gaia: Eight Lectures on the New Climatic Regime” Second Lecture ‘How not to (de-)animate nature’ 2017

Can anyone provide an analysis/thoughts of the following? 

“But the most vertiginous experience of all comes when we place the long history of the planet and the short history of humans on the same chart, not in order to stress the insignificance of humanity in the face of the Earth’s vast history, as we used to do, but, on the contrary, in order to put the burden of unprecedented geological power abruptly on the same humanity’s shoulders.” 

Thank youBruno Latour ‘how not to (de-)animate nature’"

How do I deal with these thoughts?How to deal with Eco-Anxiety?"
0,"**Runaway Hothouse Mass Extinction** \-&gt; What you need to know

The remaining 4% of wildlife are due to imminent collapse due to climate and poisoning.

There are 100 million registered chemicals, growing by 4,000 per day pre-covid. While the polar ozone hole is closing, the thicker ozone blanket everywhere else never stopped depleting. Air conditioning alone will use up all our renewable energy by 2050. But we won't make it that long. AC chemicals are smuggled into Europe and the US by China all the time. Gender bending PFAS have 5,000 derivatives.

Fluorine and chlorine mixed with petrochemicals are destroying all species and the planet's atmosphere.

There were 4 billion person flights per year pre-covid.

There are 25 billion chickens on earth, we drug the crap out them. They are so mutated that they can barely stand up by themselves. Our mistreatment of livestock is so severe that pig and chicken flu pandemics are inevitable.

The only thing that saved us from the crash of '08 was fracking. US oil exports grew 1,000% in 10 years. Methane from livestock, permafrost and frack wells is at record high. Europe and America are entering mega drought territory.

Yes kids ( I can't believe I have to say this in an environment sub ) 5G is not a holy sacrament. EMF saturation is deleterious to the health of all living things. A little mercury won't kill you, but mercury saturation will. Humans have zero tolerance to zero gravity. Even our drugs are poisoned. There is no such thing as a hi-tech ecosystem. Hi-tech ecosystem is an abominable oxymoron.

When Bayer bought Monsanto, it combined the people who sell poison with the people who sell medicine for that poison. This is called stupid. As in stupid beyond belief. There are over 100 thousand chemicals in our air, land, fabrics, materials and water. Very few are health and safety tested and nobody knows what effect they have cumulatively and inter-sectionally. Chemicals don't like to self-isolate.

The only way to even begin to address this is to adopt James Hansen's proposal of limiting private wealth with a 100% private carbon wealth tax, which means 100% goes back to you, and 0% goes to the government. This is how to fund a Universal Basic Income. Both lefties and righties hate it.

This idea was killed in 2011 by Bernie Sanders and Barbara Boxer who sponsored a law to sequester 40% of any such carbon tax dividend. Most of you kids (&gt;40) are too specialised or busy to know this.

Organised crime, cartel banking, feminism and socialism are all 100 years old. In the last 30 years emissions went up 50% and renewable reached only 4% of total global energy use. By 2040, the IEA projects renewables will hit 14%. Emissions must go down 50% in 10 years, or we will trigger unstoppable irreversible runaway hothouse mass extinction.

Our old social cosntructs cannot deliver the required change in time. It takes 40 years for global social change, no matter what your professor says. You can barely get 2 people to agree on anything, never mind 8 billion. What motivates me to tell you these terrible truths? Simple caring and honesty.

Socialism is not a requirement for freed health education and welfare. Bernie Sander is not the hero, you are. You are not better than a Trump voter, politics is not good vs. evil. Life is not a comic book.

The biggest reason that I decided to run was climate change. Our environment and economy will be ravaged by climate change if we do not act before we run out of time.That’s why I support enacting a Green New Deal so that we can begin to mobilize our economy away from our dependence on fossil fuels and create millions of green energy jobs. Climate change is not an issue that our current politicians can continue to ignore and I’m done waiting for action.

I am taking a leave of absence from medical school to run because I am done waiting on our current politicians to act on issues like climate change or enacting single-payer healthcare. Previously, I worked as an organizer for the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. I also founded a group called the Michigan Resistance, a political activist group that made thousands of calls to stop bad legislation in the Michigan State Legislature.

0,"Nine months ago we announced here the development of a new type of networking app, which combines elements of gamification with real support to wild animals, people in need, environmental challenges, and 39 other causes. All problems are explained and solutions are offered.

Thanks to the very helpful feedback from beta testers at Reddit, we have fine-tuned the app meanwhile, and just a few days ago the viaGoood app was approved on the App Store. (Android version will come later.)

We know that the launch of the app is just a first step, that is why we would like to ask you for your sincere opinion. How do you like the educational app? Is there anything you miss, or which should be different?

Please see the free iOS app here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viagoood/id1504485593

The basic idea is that, in exchange for the support or raising awareness by sharing, a symbol of the particular supported cause will appear in the virtual landscape inside the app and possible support will be transferred to the respective non-profit organization, rangers fighting poachers, nature reserves, etc. (according to the donor’s choice), and also support an awareness campaign to highlight this specific problem.

Of course, there is much more. Updates about everything important happening in the respective areas, positive news, tips, quotes, did-you-knows... And we are open to your ideas!

Please, let us know what you think about the released version. Do you believe that this concept, combining real help with education and virtual rewards to donors, can be appealing? Or, can you give us a tip for other problems that should be included in such an app too?

Thank you for any suggestions!

1992之元，梅雪竞芳之月，无可奈何之日，葛亦民致祭于天堂里的陌生人之前曰：窃思三毛自临浊世，迄今凡四十有九载，忆三毛其为质则金玉不足喻其贵，其为性则冰雪不足喻其洁，其为神则星月不足喻其精，其为貌则花月不足喻其色。

500年前带走一个印第安的灰衣人，

1年前来到台北荣总病房，

三毛对他说自己好累好累好累，

灰衣人张开了洁白的翅膀，

三毛终于放下了她的撒哈拉，

开始了另一场出发，

这个天堂里的陌生人，

坐在了耶和华的右手，

她惊奇地发现，

自己追求了一生的撒哈拉，

竟出现在耶和华的天国里。

只是三毛仍旧在重复着人们的最后一句话，

于是另一个三毛又在向人们重复另一个撒哈拉，

想必他也是一个天堂里的陌生人，

因为这个行星也没有他的位置。天堂里的陌生人---纪念三毛"
0,"I am wondering if there is not something to be learned from how cult members have been deprogrammed in order to convince people of the importance of a party structure and the inability of capitalism/the present two-party system to ever do anything about climate change due to the fact that it isn’t in the interests of those who profit off of polluting the environment.

The fact is that many people DO want to do something about climate change, but they do so screaming in the void, unable to realize that simply “raising awareness” will never materially change anything, as it has never happened. And I know that it isn’t a cult, but a cult is an ideology, and so it makes sense that someone can be deprogrammed from any ideology,

 I am not trying to argue for the merits of any one economic system, only that with our existing political and economic system, our government and corporations will do nothing meaningful until it is sadly too late, and as we can see with the criminal mismanagement of the COVID-19 response by our government, if we don’t act immediately sufficiently and extremely hard, then we will soon see ourselves have no hope of ever recovering and the planet will certainly be doomed as well as life as we know it. 

I’ve read (literally just Wikipedia) in the most basic terms that cult members are deprogrammed in this process and with the help of a psychologist and psychiatrist: 

1. Discredit the figure of authority: the cult leader

2. Present contradictions (ideology versus reality): ""How can he preach love when he exploits people?"" is an example.

3. The breaking point: When a subject begins to listen to the deprogrammer; when reality begins to take precedence over ideology.
 
4. Self-expression: When the subject begins to open up and voice gripes against the cult.

5. Identification and transference: when the subject begins to identify with the deprogrammers, starts to think as an opponent of the cult rather than as a member.

Now, any information having to do with deprogramming or just any help in general related to helping convince people to organize with us to fight climate change would be greatly appreciated. 

If you can put me in contact with a psychologist or professor, that would be incredibly appreciated, as well as if you can point me to any relevant literature

Also, I am certainly not meaning we can learn from the kidnapping of people by any means!


On another note, I came across a thing called the Ideological Turing Test where you can test to see if you are just an ideological robot who responds with preprogrammed responses. You are supposed to talk with someone with opposing views and try to get them to believe that you share their viewpoint; if you can fool them, you pass the test. I was thinking that we could, if a person seems to be doing so, we could have a third person who agrees with us and doesn’t know that they actually have opposing views to talk to them and have the other person do the test with them. Maybe them realizing they are an ideological robot would open their mind? Link below:

0,"I think that we need to re-think the way we have been trying to fight climate change. We need to form an organization that has its only goal to be fighting climate change, and it needs to be set up in the structure of a vanguard party with democratic centralism (I am not set in stone on this totally, feel free to challenge me). It needs to function like a disciplined political party. 

The reason I think this structure would be effective is because, although I am not here to talk politics, the vanguard party in the Marxist-Leninist tradition is an extremely effective TOOL to an end that has been proven throughout the 20th and 21st centuries to be useful for accomplishing the goal of getting members, educating people, keeping members active, having a coherent and well organized leadership, dedicated cadres, etc. 

This kind of thing is incredibly important if we are going to try to organize the people who already agree that climate change is an important issue. It also makes it so that we don’t need to have ALL members spending all of their time working on this, and it makes the best use of each member that we have through dedicated cadres. 

Once again, I am not saying this would be a communist party, I am saying that we can learn from the STRUCTURE of the party and it’s usefulness as a TOOL. I think this will really be a game changer because this Leninist TOOL is extremely effective and without the bad press and connotation that communism gets, the actual structure and methods can be very useful for something else: fighting climate change. 

So anyways, I believe that we need to have this political party focused on only climate change to have local chapters anywhere we can get more than two members and they can establish a local chapter. There need to be representatives from each chapter in a region to reside over each region as well as representatives from each region that form the central committee and elected general secretary. 

I believe that the most effective democratic structure is democratic centralism, wherein every member gets to voice their concerns and argue for something without fear of reprisals and then everyone votes on the course of action, and the result is binding: everyone, having had the chance to discuss with the group, must now abide by the decision of the majority. This is the most democratic form of things in a party in my opinion. 

Democratic centralism makes it so that the party is much more effective at carrying out its decisions; people will abide by what the majority has decided and do their duties, for example a member may be instructed to moderate a social media organ for the party and try to really engage with at least 10 people that day. 

Anyways, one thing that I think we need to try to get the government to do is a sort of Green COVID-19 Stimulus Plan. 

What needs to be done is the massive mobilization of the millions of people who have lost their jobs among other specialized workers that would be needed in order to construct a large high speed rail network in the USA across the country. Importantly, within each state a high speed rail should be constructed and especially and most importantly within each city there should be a rail or subway network built.

This is a massive infrastructure project, the biggest in the history of the USA no doubt; however, we see the government pumping trillions of dollars now into the economy to try to stabilize it due to the pandemic, and climate change is so much more important that it is not even comparable. 

This would create so many jobs and likely they will be lifetime jobs. Even though it seems daunting, it is NECESSARY. Even if all of it cannot be done now, just starting on the construction of the high speed rail across the country (or in each city, whichever is actually easier or would reduce emissions the most) should be done. 

In addition to the above, or perhaps instead of it, huge amounts of capital and labor should be invested in the production of many electric car factories and anything else that is necessary for their production or use. This would create a ton of good jobs, and with the huge government investment and huge production capacity, it would make electric cars much cheaper than they are now, or at least the government can subsidize their production so as to make them affordable. Their export would also make us money and the center of one of the most important industries in the world. 

The investment in the building of other sources of renewable energy where possible and research and development as well would be important. 

I know what you are thinking: this is so prohibitively expensive that it is impossible. I say you know what; 200 years ago they said that you would never set foot on the moon. I say we need to TRY. Do not just look at a task and think that it will not be possible. We don’t have a lot of options. And you know what? With this COVID-19 induced mass unemployment, this is a good time to have a massive infrastructure projects and developments of new industries; we can train unemployed workers so that they can work on the infrastructure and in these industries. 

Actually that is important separately; we need to try to get the government to offer free training for the unemployed so that they could work in the construction of high speed rail, electric cars, renewable energy, etc.

So what do you think about my idea? I know that it sounds like a pipe dream, but personally I fully believe that I’m going somewhere and I’m gonna do everything I can to try to get the ball rolling. 

Please let me know what you think and any suggestions/criticisms and if you think it’s a good idea, you should PM me!Vanguard party to fight climate change (not the Green Party)/ a Green COVID-19 Stimulus Plan"

0,"I noticed that the reaction from (many) conservatives to the COVID-19 outbreak is at first to deny it, then to downplay it, then accept it (but blame it on others and insist there is nothing we could have done to stop it). Then lastly, many are coming out to protest that it may be real, but the consequences of COVID-19 are not as bad as being out of work and having the economy be drug down with it. You can agree with that statement or not, not all conservatives are doing that, and not all are blaming others.

Now think about the reaction from conservatives to climate change... First, many deny it, many are also accepting it but downplaying it. Some are even already seeing the effects of it, but blame china and other countries. Lastly, many conservatives acknowledge climate change is real, humans are the cause, but we would have to sacrifice too much in order to help the environment (which is far from true).

Currently, compared to COVID-19, conservative views on Climate Change are in the very early stages one and two. These stages would be denial and downplay.

Let me know what you think about this comparison. More connections can definitely be made, but I thought I would outline a trend in social issues and their reactions, like these. This is a very roughly drawn correlation, please enlighten me though. Point out where it can be expanded, and point out where I have crossed the line.

Many of us have jumped off the train at some point. We saw the scope of the destruction. Everywhere it goes, hopelessness and despair. We saw that life outside the train was vibrant and regenerative. So we jumped. 

From our disembarked perspective, we see the faces of passengers as the train thunders by. Faces of people who look lost or confused. Some look scared, like they are looking for a way off but aren’t sure how. Some are preoccupied by the many shiny distractions available on the train. Blank faces stare out the window as well. 

I yell to them, “It’s time to jump! I know it can be scary, but it’s worth it!” 

Now that we are free, we are learning how to build a better future. We are creating a more harmonious world through our knowledge and our ability to work together to change our environment. The same skills that we used to build the train, we are now using to dismantle and repurpose its parts into something that is efficient, sustainable, regenerative. 

You can’t listen to those who want to keep the train going. It’s not even worth it to argue with them, just ignore them. Join our discussions. Make our voices louder, our teachers and students more numerous. Show that our world is better. 

Make the jump, and make sure you get completely clear of the train afterwards. All kinds of shit can fall off and the noise is terrible. Just keep going till you see the sign that says “Welcome to the real world!” It’s nice out here. We’ll get you set up with some food and a place to sleep. Take some time to rest and recalibrate. 

Then, when you’re ready, come meet us outside. We could use someone like you. We need new perspectives, experiences, and ideas. We’ll figure out how to use your skills and passions to shape a better future for everyone.Time to jump off the crazy train and make a better future."

Mass distribution of fluorine and chlorine mixed with carbon is destroying human plant habitat.

This unstoppable irreversible degradation also happens to the human brain in zero gravity and bad air.

The petro fluoro chloral poisoning has a cognitive and reproductive inter-generational effect across all fish frog bird human or livestock because the chemicals last forever. Plastic turns into nano plastic.

We are poisoning all classes of vertebrate to kill bugs and weeds. This affects the cognitive and reproductive survival of both bugs and all classes of vertebrates.

The farm fields are poison deserts, we have so much food because we are growing it wrong.

The dinosaur mass extinction took 10,000 years, the human and livestock use of petrochemicals has shortened mass extinction to 50 years. We are not beginning or in the middle of a mass extinction, it's already over. 

No studies have been done on how 100,000 chemicals in our systems interact negatively for species propagation safety and health. These effects can't be stopped or reversed and accumulate inter generationally.

The pandemics are because of our mistreatment of livestocks soils and plants. Green energy requires more petro fluro chloro use. Petrochemical has been growing 7X human population up to the pandemic. If people don't get healthcare they can't pick the food and high flying gamers don't pick food, they eat it.

They say we only use 100,000 of the 100 million chemicals, drug corruption is obvious. When Bayer bought Monsanto, the people who sell poison are the same people who sell a cure for that poison.

This has been going on for 100 years across generations. It exploded after 1950. Green energy requires more petro chemical mineral magic than we the environment can take.

We already destroyed all but 4% of wildlife, and the rest are going genetically and ecologically extinct.

Green energy cannot be more than 40% of total world energy use by 2050 and its petro chemical energy burden is too great for the our habitat to withstand. If we found magic phone batteries that last forever it wouldn't matter because it's already too late. We were warned 50 years ago. In the last 30 years emissions went up 50%.Only 4% Of Animals Are Wild"

0,"I'll keep it short, but I am asking. In the world of Final Fantasy 7, the world is on the verge of dying, due to an evil company that has monopolized ""mako energy"", which just so happens to be ""the literal lifeblood of the planet"".

In our world, it's basically just as simple. Instead of a single company, we have several fossil fuel ones. And the end results of both actions is that the earth is dying - or in our case, changing the climate so much that at least our civilization won't survive. 

**But make no mistake, the end result of climate change could very well be our extinction too, as shown in this fairly recent research about tipping points, which explains that if we cross a point ""somewhere between 1.5 and 2 degrees of heating"" - where we don't know - then the climate might ""tip over"" and cause automatic self-warming that could land us at a literal extinction event.**

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0

The one criticism I can give to ""Avalanche"" is that they didn't consider ""just"" trying to assassinate the leaders of ""Shinra"", which would've left a smaller death-toll, and possibly have collapsed the company, but instead opted to blow up ""mako reactors"", causing massive civilian casualties.

Though, in this world, ""Shinra"" was a company with a military, which controlled the media as well. Obviously set up to make it so that Avalanche really didn't have any options but violence.

However, with the parallels so clear between the story of Final Fantasy 7 and our own, is it even possible to try and justify the actions of ""Avalanche"" (Cloud, Barret, Tifa, Aerith etc.) and at the same time claim that it's not justified in our world?

Leave a reply on what your thoughts are. Is it justified to go swing a giant sword at oil execs? ;)In the popular game Final Fantasy 7, eco-extremist group ""Avalanche"" uses violence to literally save the world from the evil ""Shinra company"" - Are they justified or not, even though the parallels between ""Shinra"" and the fossil fuel industry are clear?"

It shouldn't be a secret these days that we are running out of time to address global warming and climate change. The top level goal of the U.N. and the IPCC which has been adopted by most of the world's governing bodies from 2015's Paris Climate Agreement is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C by reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Both talked about the unlikelihood of maintaining warming below 2 degrees C by 2100.Behind the scenes the discussion is how difficult even limiting warming to 2degC is going to be, especially in the current political climate."

Some countries are dependent on tourism like Dubai for example. But there's no need to constantly fly. I understand some people are dependent on flying (for whatever matter) which i also discovered when i made a poll in my previous thread and i don't judge, i understand there can be hinderances. I also understand that planes need to deliver things like medicine. But i think its important to know that the environment really changes drastically and fast towards the better when humans drastically change their habits by cutting down on traveling worldwide and not use vehicles that emits pollution. Also as i mentioned previously i'm not saying ""never fly"". But we still need to be an example to mother earth. We should also listen to climate scientists.

**It’s supposed to work the other way round**

This moment in history may not be allowed  
To one day be reduced to that horrible memory  
Of the time when a misanthropic virus  
Obliterated our oldest generations.  
This is also the moment when our children,  
Selflessly do their part and make their sacrifice.  
One of education,  
Of companionship,  
Of social development,  
And of personal freedom.  
All to slow the virus’s maniacal spread  
And to keep hospitals operating below full capacity.

For the well-being of their elders,  
They form new routines,  
Grow accustomed to isolation and seclusion,  
And do so with consideration and compassion,  
And do so without protest.

And once the global quarantine is over,  
Will this ongoing sacrifice be forgotten?  
Or downplayed?  
Or dismissed?

Will airlines once again be allowed to carve highways in the stratosphere,  
Heating the planet with their emissions and jet streams?  
Will economies once again be allowed to pursue their insatiable thirst for growth,  
Heedless of the Earth that can no longer sustain it,  
And numb to our children’s love?

For you see,  
Even before this crisis,  
The children had been going to school  
And living their lives as inhabitants of this planet

Without a nice story.

── And we were numb to them then.

With little to look forward to  
And even more to dread.

But we now know what we can accomplish.  
When we really want to.  
When we really try.  
Now we know that we can shut down emissions when we want to.  
We can divest from fossil fuels.  
We can stop the drilling.  
We can halt the runaway deforestation.  
We can raise wind turbines and solar farms  
With the ambition of the societies that covered the world with road and rails  
One hundred years ago.  
We can train workers for the  
Stimulating,  
Formative,  
And even till now restrained  
Green, Social, and Artistic Industries.

If we reduce the memory of this pandemic to its horror and its pain  
And allow the ongoing sacrifice of our grandchildren to be forgotten,  
Downplayed,  
Or dismissed,  
And if we go on living with a sense of entitlement,  
Halting the progress that endangers the fulfilment of our every frivolous whim,  
Of our every appetite and pleasure,  
Our grandchildren will inherit a world in a permanent state of crisis and shortage.  
Droughts.  
Forest fires.  
Rising sea levels.  
Ocean acidification.  
Mass extinction.  
To name a few.  
There, in that world,  
The sacrifices and abstinence of this unfolding pandemic  
Would tragically pale in comparison.  
For today the supermarkets are full  
And we are still revitalized and inspired by the green.

If we can park the children,  
To save our skin,  
We must finally park our comfort and paralysis in their name,  
Decidedly and for good.

It’s the parents who are supposed to take care of their children.  
But the children are the ones currently making the concessions.  
They are the ones putting us first,  
Although it should be the other way round.

But it does not have to be this way.  
We have to finally acknowledge our responsibility

0,With the Green Party of America holding there primary’s at the moment and Joe Biden winning the dems nominee I’ve noticed a lot of people saying they are going to vote green over Biden. From an environmentalist perspective and feel it is very risky to give a climate science denier (as well as a pandemic science denier) another 4 years as president (which a vote for 3rd party practically dose). With the new rise of this “Ecosocialism” and this new found thinking that implementing such an ideology would fix our problems better then Neo liberalism I believe to be false for a number of reasons. This being fixing climate change isn’t an economically profitable platform (from a governmental perspective not a business one) this is because it would cost people’s jobs. This has been seen with the the coal/farming industry with manny loosing there jobs there and coal county electing representatives such as Rand Paul who are obviously more interested in keeping there jobs. So if the work place was democratised as it would be under socialism no worker is going to vote to loose there job and every worker will vote towards what will make there company/ government run entity most profitable which would be to lower regulation on the environment as so they will get paid more. This under capitalism can be changed with a business actually profiting off being eco friendly with a good public outreach and for showing results such as  solar panels and eco friendly cars that have been implemented along side government regulation of the businesses which leads to fair competition between businesses. Companies such as McDonalds have decided to switch to paper straws. A government subsidy on paper straws to make it cheeper for business to buy whilst if this was a government run entity and the people controlling it were only interested in what would raise there wages they would buy the plastic straws as there cheaper (for say I don’t actually know the prices for plastic and paper straws I’m just using it as an example) others are businesses supplying vegan food for there workers at lunch as to encourage them to work for them over other company’s if this was socialised the workers would want the cheapest food bought as to make a profit and supply for there families (because if there living in a socialist county they probably will be in poverty).

Also get America back into the Paris accord ffsSocialism isn’t good for the environment

With the Green Party in America doing there primary’s and the Democrats primary’s have shown Biden as the winner I’ve noticed manny people saying they are going to vote Green Party. I find this quite worrying from an environmentalist perspective as I feel 4 more years of a climate science denier (and a pandemic science denier) is not ideal and a vote for 3rd parry or to be blunt a vote for anyone other then Joe Biden is a vote for that. I’ve noticed manny Turning towards this idea of “eco socialism” and the idea that socialism as an idea would be what’s best for the environment. I disagree as solving climate change is not economically profitable (from a governmental perspective) if we socialise the work place then workers will vote towards what would earn there company/government entity the most money and thus earn more money for themselves. In the current status quo companies face competition in the free market against other companies to have a good public view. Companies that sell solar panels and eco friendly cars are making a lot of money. McDonald’s have switched to having paper straws over normal straws. If a government was to subsidise paper straws to make them more affordable companies could buy them more rather then if McDonalds was fully government/ worker run they would just choose the cheapest option. In some workplaces they provide vegan food in order to attract others to work for them over other companies if this was socialist run they would have just chosen the cheapest option as vegan food is quite expensive compared to cheap meets. Areas with heavy coal/farming industry would have little to no regulation considering they would just vote it all off in order to keep there jobs.

0,"If you shave wet and use currently one of those razors with replaceable heads, they are nice and all but I switched tona safety razor with regular razor blades and they are good for many reasons

A: They are way smaller. 100 razor blades (aka 200 edges) are as big as about 2 packs of 4 of my old razor heads. That's a whole lot more shaving and a whole less space taken up on the way from the production to you, saving shipping volume (to get 200 heads youd need more than 20x the volume) and you need to buy less often

B: No plastic, less materials. So, For test purposes I shaved a patch of my legs with my old and new razor and I cannot tell a difference, and on my face it's also working perfectly. That's weird considering it is only one blade shaving me and not 4 at once. This hugely decreases plastic waste especially for those who use shave daily. 

I didn't even know they existed, and this is for those who also don't know they existed and are a reliable alternative. One step up would be a straight razor but that's too much for me and probably most peopleHow about using safety razors?"

The fact that anyone thinks that will change with some more wind and solar energy needs to truly examine whether they think that because they want it to be true or because it is actually viable. Do we really think one day we're gonna wake up in a world with nothing but green energy on every continent and country, no matter its wealth? That when we wake up that morning, climate change will have been halted in its tracks and we can sing kumbaya and rejoice for we have triumphed? It feels utterly ridiculous to me at this point.

For every one solar panel that goes up in California, another hundred acres are cut down in the Amazon, hundreds of pounds of plastic are dumped into our oceans and into the throats of birds, and we take one step closer to ecological collapse. I am so sick of this optimistic passiveness among mainstream environmentalists who think that the solutions to a dying world lay in the same kinds of corporate masters who should be put before The Hague for destroying it. Every day the our species and millions of others who cant resist for themselves goosestep closer to extinction and the supposed leaders in our movements seem to think we can replace the Stahlhelms with flower crowns and go along with our day.

0,"I'm not a farmer, and I haven't kept up with agriculture since high school, honestly. But my parents live in the middle of a crop field, and we had an event yesterday. 
My mom and I were outside enjoying the nice weather, around 6-7pm, they started fertilizing the fields across the road with what my mom believes is anhydrous ammonia. The air burned when they spread it, it smelled overwhelmingly awful, and my mother has breathing problems already and said she couldn't breathe for awhile after it happened. We rushed inside to escape it. We've lived here for 20 years, almost my entire life, and never smelled ammonia in the air like this. Ever. 
My question to you guys is, when they spread anhydrous fertilizer, they inject it into the soil, yes? Is it supposed to smell overwhelmingly potent, as it did yesterday, or do you think they might have had some kind of leak?
If it IS supposed to be like that, is it a hazard to surrounding communities or residents? There's a tiny village next to the field as well, across from our house. Like I said, my mom had trouble breathing after it happened. If this continues, it could be a problem for us.

0,"Poetic Science = cut n past text

There are 3 levels of freshwater = surface + root + ground

The world runs on 4 magic crops

Water has magic sonic qualities or some shit

Energy mixes the 2 for food = no mo slavery

no slavery = middle class boom 

Instead of trickle down, we got trickle back

trickle back doesn't work when wind blades smash a fecal mist

Back to our sponsored message. Oil rig wind turbine blades depend on gay commie nazi jews for money market investors. If I was getting my freak on a CRISPR gene machine in my mom's basement, this would be the perfect weapon. 

The first thing it did was clean the air a bit, and skyrocketed and divorce and abuse. It also facilitates the largest transfer of money since China got rich. It gets rid of old rich people and leaves Bill Gates a bunch of young rich pussy. A computer in every room is not a bug up every ass. Microsoft and google want to nanao dick fuck your ass and your mind for money. That's fancy accounting talk for rape and abuse you.

Not only will all the nano plastic/mineral particles make you gay stupid sterile and sick, it will make more money ratting you out to marketers than you pay for the pleasure of its debt. In China your phone knows you're going to jaywalk before you do. By putting micro cams everywhere you increase the AI curve, we call it heightening the curve. Either that or getting a hard on. But I digress.

In the future your car takes you to the cops whenever you don't do what mob money says. They say these monstrosities will drive themselves and can be mined from the sun and the wind, while we tweak n twerk forever on mars. Raw power corrupts and data is power. This incentivises the bug up every ass data economy. Bill Gates wanted a computer in every house and apple/google want a bug up every ass. A non-male, non-favorite metaphor for female spies. Women are worse rapers of Gaia than men because they know better.

Google literally means, sell your mom &amp; target your kids for a buck. Each life data aspect is worth big money to corrupt foreign buyers. You can't burn olive kids for rich gay saudi jews and oil security and save the earth at the same time. It's called crazy. Get used to it. It's not going anywhere. You can't pay boy to burn baby butt and not lose your soul. 

The rich non-offending pedo side wants the law to take away their guns for a highly militarized protected state. That means rich tranny pedos got mo rights than poor bitches like me. The fight must end to save the earth.

There is no victory there, there. Winning is history, only survival matters and nobody is giving up their cars with blue tooth butt plug leather seats. The people with guns have to want to give them up. Having the army take their guns only leaves evil rich pedo goat fuckers with guns, instead of evil rich pedo sheep fuckers. Money markets don't car which kind of fuck that is, just like death doesn't care what you think.

Whatever wiped out red headed sea apes 10,000 years ago didn't do a very good job because now all those fucking idiots want to deploy vast giant fleets of wind power. This isn't the victory of capitalism as billed, it's capitalism sucking on the governor tit, like an infant with gay white jew talons. 

Intellectuals can't sway believers because they are corrupt. I would no more trust a priest or physicist than a doctor, lawyer or teacher. People sense their lack of faith and corruption because it seethes out of their skin like nano micro beads of sulphur and dead olive babies. Doctors lawyer teachers want to stay rich. They dirve cars that burn palm soy and corn oil and call it green. They ship in wood and call it bio-energy. They burn recycled paper and plastic while calling recycled energy. They got more kinds of PFAS than candy stores have candy.  

After us oldies are dead and gone they're going to sell more of the same, plus a giant tit sucking fleet of poisonous plastic fish food. When micropartlices and rain hit a wind turbine blade, they can hit up to 600 mph collisions, slowly chipping and pitting the leading edge into the sea for fish to eat.

For every fitbit and 5G IOT bug up your ass, you are contributing to the end of the human species and all life on earth. For every little girl and boy stuck on their beds are prisoners of the lies we tell them. By not letting them know, you are lying. No matter how many toxic make up and pedo beauty pageants there are.

This phoney capitalist commie war is the game of rich white gay nazi jews and arab persians. The white and yellow fight over the olive and black for their treasure. They want that treasure to stick little tiny bugs up your ass for your precious fucking data. This data can predict what you are going to do before you do. It knows which of the fifty ways your going to leave your lover, before your're leaving it will send you a sympathy card. This is the apple of good and evil. 

The only reason we got copyright and hate laws is because no one can stand listening to gay white jews in court talk for 2 hours, and nobody has the balls left to tell them because we're all turning into stupid sterile simps.

I wouldn't be surprised if the gay interstellar fungi network, named Phil McCrackin weren't trying to protect us the spiteful revenge of the native polar space lizard lesbos. Now that would be ironic, all over a few mushrooms we stole way back when. The ultimate joke is on my.  I may not believe all this nonsense, but it is what it is... ins't it?

Just remember mister brown and mister black, yellow and whitey want to rape your girl. The rich will move to SW Asia and Africa, while the poor move into Europe and Canuckistan. I call this country Canuckistan because I wanted to be a heroic Taliban atheistic fighter, or some vague typical notion the old exploit the young for.The Old Exploit The Young Since Life Began = Conspiracy Started Soon After Big Bang As Interstellar Fungi Network Named Phil McCrackin"

Hi, I'm an incoming Grade 10 Student. We might take our NCAE Test in the upcoming months. I was still indecisive about the career that I want to pursue. I know there are still years left before college, but I was very curious about the path that I want to take. I have lots of questions.

\*What are the jobs that are embodied in studying Animal Biology, Wildlife Studies, and Environment Studies?

\*How can I ensure that I can get a stable job when I graduate? Should I get a master's degree after I graduate? or I should serve for government jobs to repay for my scholarship (like DOST).

\*What course should I take if I want to pursue to be a Wildlife Biologist or Animal Rehabilitator? Should I take BS Bio or BS Forestry? or should I take other courses?

\*What school really does focuses on these aspects? Should I take a famous and well-known school?

\*How many years can it take to have a stable career? What is the estimated income of these jobs?

\*They said that if I study this track, I might end up being a teacher because my ideal career is not having a major impact on our country. Am I really going to be a teacher?

\*Lastly, should I take other courses first and find a temporary job to earn money to study these courses?

I'm really sorry for asking clown questions, It might seem laughable but I only have a little information about this track that I want. Please notice my message and help me clarify these things. Thank you so much for your valuable time!I Want to be a Wildlife Biologist Someday, But I'm still Indesicive because of my lack of Knowledge In this Track. Help Me Please..."

0,"Hey folks, I want you to imagine something for a sec: what if instead of mourning our loved ones in graveyards dedicated to death, we celebrated them in forests dedicated to life? I'm trying to make this vision a reality by building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a memorial tree when you die (by mixing CO2-neutrally cremated ashes with seeds and soil), and lays that tree to rest into a 'memorial forest' space – the graveyard of the 21st century. It's the first full-cycle ashes-to-tree concept. I have a lot of visions for what this memorial forest space would be like – it would be a beautiful, tranquil place you want to stay awhile. It would be a place for reflecting on the past and reconnecting with the present and with nature. There would be regular events to keep the space alive. I am even imagining planting QR codes at the base of each memorial tree – when you scan them, these codes would pull up a live forum where friends and relatives of that person can post memories and photos, giving you an insight into who they were. It's the best way for someone coming to the end of their life to complete the circle of life and leave a sustainable legacy, and its a new way for all of us who remain to stay connected to those we have lost. If you think this is a great concept, please join the movement. All you have to do is sign this expression of interest form (and share!): https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/relive-the-sustainable-death-care-solution The more signatures I have, the more I can demonstrate people are interested in this, and the more likely I am to find an investor who will help me bring this concept to life.

0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls step right up and catch a glimpse of how the world ended!—. To dramatic?  I think not.   Let me be clear, in the last 175 years our world has seen an explosion of growth that has resulted in a global warming of the surface temperature of the planet.  In some regions that warming has been almost 2 degrees Centigrade.  (Which according to all the available information 10 years ago is a very bad thing.)  The problem is we have reached that mark and people still don’t believe that it’s dangerous.  The fires in Australia, the floods in the Midwest and now Coronavirus all signal an end of days situation and yet our leaders are ineptly pushing forward with tired and broken policies that have brought us to the brink.   I’m not a scientist, and I don’t play one on television but I do have enough intelligence to know that when you change one thing in a system as large and complex as our planet the results can be unfathomable.  The best example of this is “the Butterfly Effect” but instead of changing the weather in NYC this butterfly flaps its wings and creates a life ending pandemic spawning virus.   Our movements toward a fully industrialized and fossil fuel dependent world has lead us to a stage where weather isn’t the only risk we face in a warming environment.   No, right now we face a greater threat and sadly our leaders are not prepared to face it.  Our warming planet harbors billions of life forms that need certain environmental conditions to survive.  And while we like to always speak in terms of the life that we are losing due to global warming (coral reefs, polar bears to name the most common) no one is talking openly about the lives that are being given new leases like SARS-COV2 or COVID-19 as we all know it.  Yes I am saying what I fear no one else will.  This virus isn’t just a rare virus that came out of the animal world and found a way to thrive in a human population.  No it’s much more that that.   Like all life this virus needs conditions to be exactly right for it to get a foot hold.  Temperatures and moisture levels must be within an optimal range and the host population must be susceptible to reception/infection in some way or another.  Sadly because of the way our species lives in such close proximity to one another, and because we have caused our planet to warm, COVID-19 has found exactly what it needs to emerge and thrive.  But hey, there isn’t all bad news from this pandemic.  I do have good news for you.  There is hope.  You see, this pandemic isn’t (or shouldn’t be anyway) about a failure in our medical systems (and what a spectacular failure it has been) but rather this virus is a clarion call to every person on this planet.  This virus is our 2 minute warning.  It is the point in the game that we must rally from behind and score those precious touchdowns/goals needed to save our future.  We need to change how we move forward.  We need to focus on getting away from fossil fuels,  we need to rebuild those natural buffers between mankind and the wild natural world that we live in.   Not as a measure to prevent or control diseases or disasters but as a way to strengthen our environmental protections.  It may not be clear by the way we talk about our planet, but we live in such an amazing place.  The environmental protections that I’m referring to are not things that we need to put in place to protect our environment but rather they are things that our environment has in place to protect us.   I hope that what we learn from this pandemic and the lives we lose is that our actions as a species, have much greater significance for us than they do for the planet itself.  Because truth be told, nature has been quite accommodating to the human species and would continue to be so if we just stop removing all the safeguards in place to keep us alive.  Remember, our existence is in jeopardy not our planet.  So in closing I want to ask you all to continue to socially distance, but also think about how we have changed our habits in the face of an imminent disaster and we did it because death is scary and if we don’t change death is what potentially awaits us. Not just now in this instance but forever more moving forward.  We can change our habits and our way of doing things this virus has proven it so we have no more excuses  we need to do it now more than ever because as we continue to change our planet we are removing the protections that have been in place to keep human beings safe.  It’s time to consider replacing/repairing them or building new ones before our planet decides to move on with out us.Rising Oceans, Burning Forests, And Oh Yeah, Killer Viruses!"

0,"I was wondering if anyone can speak to the effectiveness of pre-filled mail-in petitions that come in the mail from environmental groups.  They are usually addressed to Trump or my local congressmen, and are completely pre-filled and have my name attached, only awaiting my signature and for me to mail it in.  A few months ago I began making monthly donations to a major environmental advocacy group and my mail is getting absolutely mobbed with these things.

It seemed like a lot of these were really just foot-in-the-door ways for other environmental groups to solicit donations from me as well (since all of the petition packets include more sign-up sheets and donation forms).  And it doesn't seem like the current administration is listening to public opinion at all.  I kind of get the impression the lot of these would get immediately thrown in the bin by whatever politician gets it.  So I was just wondering if it's worth my time to fill these out, or if I should continue focusing my time and energy on other environmental projects.How effective are the pre-filled mail-in petitions I get in the mail?"

Last month, mountains reminded me again how even a simple road access could change a small community. It gives livelihood to the farmer and convenient access to education. Though planting a tree is not the only solution we can offer, but it is about changing the hearts of the community towards responsible farming and promoting sustainable solutions for environmental issues. Still, we need baby steps. Solutions come from the people in locality who could create their own ways of protecting the things around them.

Written Essay - 

&amp;#x200B;

PFASs, or Perfluroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of man-made chemicals originally used for coating tanks; but are now used in waterproof clothes, firefighting foams, teflon pans and even pizza boxes. PFASs consist of a carbon chain surrounded by several fluorine atoms joined to an acid group. The carbon-fluorine bond is incredibly strong, and causes the carbon chain to repel water and oil as well as shielding it from just about any biological, chemical or thermal attack (below 1,000 degrees C). These incredible chemical properties allowed PFASs to be used in thousands of different products but have also allowed them to become almost untreatable toxic pollutants. Keep watching to discover the history and future of these chemicals, as well 5 easy tips to fight PFAS pollution. Carbon-fluorine bonds are rarely found in nature and so no life or other natural pathways have evolved to break them down \[2\]. PFASs also bioaccumulate, meaning that once they get into living tissue, they remain there, building up progressively higher concentrations \[3\] which also increase along the food chain.    To make things worse, these compounds are unaffected by conventional water treatment systems \[5\] and as of 2016, at least 7 million Americans' water supplies are tainted with PFASs and scientists have actually found PFASs in water samples almost everywhere on earth \[6\], \[7\] as well as in soils, plants, animals and in 99% of humans. Technologies have been developed to remove PFASs from water and soil and are slowly being implemented. But the challenge remains as to what we do with these nearly indestructible chemicals once collected. This is something academics and industrial groups are still working on. But just how toxic are they?    PFASs cause increased risk of hormone imbalances, high cholesterol, reduced birth weights Testicular, Prostate, Pancreatic and Liver cancers, possible DNA damage \[8\],\[9\] and birth defects, to name a few. Many of these symptoms were discovered by two of the companies who made PFASs, DuPont and 3M, in their own workers. But almost none of this was ever disclosed to its customers, employees, the EPA or the communities it was poisoning. Despite the dangers, and having alternative disposal methods, for decades, DuPont released hundreds of tons of toxic PFAS into the Ohio River and contaminated the water supplies of over 100,000 people in West Virginia, making many of them extremely sick. This is in addition to the thousands of tonnes of PFASs in Teflon products which ended up in consumers' food and eventually landfills around the world. DuPont even developed a less toxic and less bioaccumulative alternative to use in its manufacture of Teflon … but decided against it as the profitability of the new chemical was unknown. By the early 2000’s, the average American had 5 times the amount of PFAS in their blood that DuPont considered safe for its factory’s drinking water \[1\], \[4\].    Thankfully, 3M ceased the manufacture of some PFASs in early 2000 with DuPont following suit much later 2013 \[4\]. A lawsuit headed by Rob Billot - the real life hero on which the movie Dark Waters is based - eventually proved DuPoint’s guilt over the illegal dumping of PFASs. As a result, they agreed to implement water filtration systems in the affected areas, which they failed to do. The lawsuit did however fund 7 years of scientific study into the health effects of PFASs, including the largest epidemiological study in human history with 71,000 affected civilians as participants. Researchers proved a link between one PFAS and increased risk of kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis. DuPont disputed the findings but eventually settled for around $700M, however, DuPont makes over $1B a year from Teflon alone and has never admitted any guilt \[1\], \[4\].   In the last decade, two PFASs (PFOS and PFOA) were added to the Stockholm convention which strongly regulates organic pollutants. These two chemicals are now only permitted for use in small quantities where no alternatives exist, such as in scientific research \[10\], \[11\]. However, at least 5,000 new PFASs (REF Denmark report) have been developed which are much less regulated or medically understood. Some of these new PFASs are less harmful and less bioaccumulative, but they can be converted into more harmful products once they’re degraded in the environment \[2\]. Drinking water standards now limit PFASs to a few parts per trillion, thats equivalent to about one drop in several thousand Olympic swimming pools. But no one is really sure of a safe limit. Other than none.   The actions of Rob Billot go to show what a truly monumental difference one individual can make. That said, here’s 5 easy tips you can take to fight PFAS pollution. One, support action to regulate these chemicals in consumer products: by going to [https://www.darkwatersfilm.co.uk/signup/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;stzid=UgwDbjNBtbt_z2TJP_B4AaABAg&amp;redir_token=hPwedsfJxpl7qBJSo3fWKjY1V2J8MTU4NTU5NDY3MkAxNTg1NTA4Mjcy&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.darkwatersfilm.co.uk%2Fsignup%2F&amp;html_redirect=1) and signing the petition. Two, be informed about what’s in the products you buy, including in packaging and avoid PFASs wherever possible. Three, consider buying a ceramic or steel pan next time you need new cookware to reduce the amount of PFASs in your food. Four, petition for governments and water boards to measure the concentration of PFASs in household water supplies. Five, understand more about the history of PFAS pollution by watching the film Dark Waters and also read the New York Times article The-lawyer-who-became-dupont's-worst-nightmare” on which the film was based \[4\].

0,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I find it very compelling to think about how the current virus outbreak might be a way of bringing the balance back in check. Human beings have been consuming so excessively for years and years, with no signs of stopping and no remorse or sense of responsibility from many people. The ""patient 0"" for COVID-19 seems to have come from a market in China where they were selling poultry, bats, snakes, and other wildlife animals. The virus looks like it might have come from ""the wrong bat meeting up with the wrong snake."" Perhaps if humans were more responsible in how we treated the other creatures on this earth, these kind of diseases wouldn't crop up so often? 

Also, the fact that we're all so crowded together makes it much more difficult to contain the spread. There are people everywhere, all the time. Overpopulation is an especially bad thing to have (for us) when we want everyone to keep away from each other. 

I hope that maybe people will realize they don't have to drive as much and consume as much after being told they shouldn't leave their homes for a matter of months.

This is just my viewpoint, and the Wuhan market is just one market. I know the majority of people don't put multiple species of animals in crates together in probably filthy conditions. I just think the connection is very interesting, and it's like a wake-up call for everyone to be more responsible to the planet. However, I don't see this link being pointed out anywhere else and I wanted to see if anyone else has thought of it.Connections between unsustainable consumerism and COVID-19?"

So, we have been tracking our company's waste diversion rate (which is supposedly a best practice for many companies): (recycled contents)/(waste + recycled contents). 

I want to use another metric to measure the amount we are actually re-using instead of recycling as well.
i.e., I can't find information on a re-use rate/metric but I'm thinking the formula would look like this: (reuse)/(recycled + reused) ?

Or is there another best practice metric I could utilize? Let me know if that makes sense otherwise I could elaborate. Thanks!Trying to determine a metric/rate similar to waste diversion rate, but moreso for re-using over recycling. Any best practices for measuring reusing?"

The  COVID-19 quarantine has shown significant effects on pollution levels  around the world \[1\]. Within that article you can see the significant  reduction in pollution as high as 40%-60%. If one were to look at the  reduction in pollution in California, you can see it is attributed to  the average consumer. In fact most of the energy, manufacturing and  agriculture industries are still running, deemed essential services at  the time of the observation of the pollution change \[2\]. The change in  pollution levels is not from big corporations, but the needless  consumption of the average citizen in their daily lives.

In  fact, within CNN's own article of the effects of C19 on pollution, they  show a picture of power plants and industry as if they were the main  contributor to pollution. Those factories and power plants were still  running the same at that time as they were before C19. Within the  climate activism community there seems to be too much of a focus on big  evil corporations with evil smoke stack pictures (usually water vapor in  reality) that cause the worlds environmental problems. Articles like to  blame the corporations such as this one \[3\], which claims 71% of  pollution comes from only 100 different companies. What this article  does not say is that the study puts the blame for the gas that you buy,  and put in your car to burn is cited as ExxonMobil's fault. In reality  it is your responsibility as you are the consumer who purchased it. C19  shows the effect of the collective of individual consumers on pollution,  vastly outweighing corporations.

SO WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT:

I  am not a ""boot licker"" for big corporations, but I believe this needs  to be addressed because I am passionate about the well being of the  environment. ""Corporation"" has become the boogeyman of political  discourse. We need to remember that corporations are just conglomerates  of investors, that serve our consumption interests. They do not profit  from extracting oil from the Earth. They profit from selling it to us.  The continued  targeting of corporations is only shifting the blame from  us. It is easier to blame some entity that we make some connotation  about than to accept our own faults. It is crippling any real progress  to the climate crisis, as we are targeting what we see as a ""few bad  apples"", when in reality, the climate change crisis requires drastic  change in YOUR lifestyle. Too much of climate activism focuses on  shutting down and regulating big corporations and their ""scary"" smoke  stacks, which seem far off from your own personal lives. The pictures of  the smoke stacks are not the problem. It is your unnecessary use of  cars, taking vacations on planes, use of air conditioning, and daily  lifestyles. Legislation, if made, need to target that average American  just as much as corporations. Trickle Down Economics has been shown to  not work, Trickle Down Climate Activism will not work either.

0,"Early returns from some areas of the world have demonstrated how global sheltering in place has positively affected the environment.  Consider how this enforced frugality can be the first big step in saving our world from global warming. So far, people have stayed home, limited trips to stores, cut back on social gatherings, canceled vacations (especially on airlines and cruise ships), decreased use of autos, and  worked from home whenever possible.
    This self- imposed discipline saved lives by limiting the spread of a deadly virus. What if, after the sanctions are lifted, every family limits or stops an activity similar to what they couldn’t do during the pandemic. This small sacrifice may well reduce pollution. The COVID-19 produced a tangible and immediate threat. Global warming will be equally dire for our children and grandchildren.

Contrary to MSM reports, the ozone layer has never stopped depleting between 60° N and 60° S, in the lower part of the upper atmosphere, where the vast majority of ozone resides. Most people live between those 2 latitudes.

UV radiation always gets stronger the closer you get to the equator, and more people live there.

The earth’s magnetic field is weakening extremely fast and affects South America and south Africa most.

A weakening magnetic field lets in more UV radiation, which combined with lower ozone protection, means people can expect increased solar radiation sickness, but especially in South America and south Africa. Sun tan lotion makes corals sick.

Air Conditioning demand is skyrocketing due to longer, more intense heat blocks.

By 2050, air conditioning is expected to use up all available renewable energy production.

This AC gold rush will result in more chemical smuggling and more ozone destruction.

The rush of human urbanization is biggest in China, who pour more cement in 3 years than America ever had. They pave enough roads to cover America 2X each year. They have mega projects coming out the ying yang.

The LA SanFran rail project has been pushed to 2033. World emissions must be down 50% by that time.

The gold rush for condos worldwide will result in construction fraud and unsafe buildings. Safe construction sand is running out. Construction fraud is the new normal.

The thick blanket of ozone at mid-latitudes has never stopped depleting. This is where the vast majority of ozone is, and is needed most.

Ozone destroying chemicals are not counted when used as feedstocks for industry. Ozone fraud and smuggling are rampant.

Due to climate change there has been a bigger push for renewable energy and a low carbon economy. Though, since the drop in oil prices and the covid virus there seems to be more talk about this being an ideal time for governments to change investments and really choose a green route.  I’m curious who are the original institutions or think-tanks that are pushing for this more recent divest and reinvest idea? I’m interested in reading the thoughts from well informed non bias sources. Preferably with comparisons in energy output, feasibility of switching energy sources and the economic side. 

TLDR: what institutions started this push for divestment in oil since the global economy has dipped?

I reckon the percentage is fairly small. 

I usually only buy clothes from natural materials, but synthetics are clearly advantages when it comes to workout and winter clothing (ie: fleece, quick dry tee shirts). Of course, wool is natural and is excellent when it comes to warmth. However, I'm skeptical in that I don't know how much plastic waste is produced from gathering a set amount of wool. I was thinking about potential waste from taking care and feeding the sheep (ie: plastic sacks containing sheep feed, syringes, etc.). **How much plastic waste comes from wool production, and does it even make sense to use as a synthetic clothing alternative in regards to reducing plastic waste?**

The reason to have an [emergency budget](https://www.cypressoft.com/post/how-to-build-an-emergency-budget-and-why-companies-need-it) is simple. Nobody knows what’s going to happen and neither does anyone want to live at the mercy of life twists and turns. The emergency fund comes in handy if the company faces sudden changes. This safety net is essential between the life and company.

When the time comes and the companies don't have anything set aside, they may lay off or anticipate the financial suffering soon. This is the exact time of considering switching to the emergency budget.

These emergency budget focuses only on essential things and leaves the most or all discretionary spendings out. That means that everything which isn’t absolutely necessary is ignored. The primary goal is to free up a budget enough for boosting savings contributions.

0,"Yes, you read it right. If you’re one who eats chocolate on a daily basis, there’s a high chance you’re not wired to be an eco-warrior. Confused? Let me explain. 

For past decades scientists in a field of neuropsychology made some essential breakthroughs. We’ve learned many interesting things about how human brains develop, work and how humans think in general. Making a long story short, the conclusion so far is quite contradictory. Humans are a piece of marvel - one of the most complex structures and by far the smartest in the known universe, and at the same time - no more clever than a lizard (with all due respect to all lizards).

There are a few scientific systems to explain this phenomenon. Definitions like system 1 and system 2, heuristics, cognitive biases and others come into use to make sense of it all. For the sake of simplicity, I will call it - human dualism.  Humans are dual creatures - at the same time we are logical Gods of the Earth, smartest creatures ever, and monkeys, instinct-driven primates (with all due respect to all monkeys). 

Now, why am I telling you this? 

Because we humans, when it comes to complex topics like **climate change**, are also dualists. In a decade-long string of surveys on “[Climate Change in the American Mind,](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/2/)” run by researchers at Yale and George Mason University, show that more than 60 percent of respondents said global warming is caused mostly by humans. 

What is more: “The percentage of Americans who say global warming is personally important is now at a record high, 72 percent,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of Yale’s program on climate change communication.

Therefore, we can easily come to a simple conclusion: more and more people are aware of climate change and their responsibility for it, however, obviously not enough action is taken from those people to stop it. Paradox? Not really. 

As mentioned earlier, humans (including, you dear reader, and me) are designed to be dualists. We can clearly and logically understand obvious truths, however, we’re full of behavioral and cognitive biases that lead our actions in the wrong way. 

One of them is **Hyperbolic discounting**, a.k.a. present-bias or current moment bias. Generally speaking, this is our perception that the present is more important than the future, for example: why shouldn't I eat that chocolate for immediate gratification now, even if I know it has bad implications for my health in the future or why shouldn’t I buy that diesel truck even I know it has bad implications for the environment in the future and consequently for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

 Hi reddit person,

I am shook by the current state of our country. I have recently reached a(nother) tipping point and feel called to do...something. So I went through my facebook and messaged everyone a version of this message, and am now expanding my net to people I don't know. The political environment is changing quickly, it’s truly a historic moment of tremendous possibility and hope, one that we the people can, and honestly need to take advantage of, in order to have political power and further our interests of having a chill life without the ultra-rich bankrupting us and destroying our home. 

As someone who no longer has a job, I have a lot more free time on my hands. If you are able, I urge you to take action, in whatever way is possible for you. There are the classics: calling congresspeople to sway their vote on legislation, tweeting at them to call them out, posting about political issues on facebook to raise awareness, but what else can we do?

This is a broad appeal for political action, and the main reason I’m posting this is to share with you that the **Sunrise Movement** (very groovy youth-led climate justice organization I’m in which has given me just so much hope and resilience) is seizing this moment to build the skills and power that we need to confront the crises we’re facing, by launching **Sunrise School**! Unlike most things in our society, it’s **free**! It’s an online community where people (focus is on people under 35, but everyone is welcome!) will: build connections with others seeking change; learn how we the people can confront the crises we’re facing and reclaim political power; develop new organizing skills; and learn how to take action in this new reality. [https://www.sunrisemovement.org/sunrise-school](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/sunrise-school)

I want to say!!! Sunrise Movement is an environmental justice movement, with its overall goal being to pass the Green New Deal (congressional resolution) - yes, the name implies a bunch of environmental stuff, ya know save trees n shit, but it’s WAY more than that - the Green New Deal is about fixing ridiculously massive economic inequality, and having a fair transition from fossil fuels that empowers and benefits communities most affected by climate change, and creating a bunch of actually good jobs for people, and treating energy as a human right, and stopping climate change. The Sunrise Movement is about empowering people with the tools, resources, strategy, and community to take action and reclaim political power at all levels of government.

&amp;#x200B;

There are several online classes available at the moment, with more to come:

"" Animal agriculture puts a heavy strain on many of the Earth’s finite  land, water and energy resources. In order to accommodate the[ 70 billion animals](http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E) raised annually for human consumption, a third of the[ planet’s ice-free land surface](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7369/full/nature10452.html), as well as nearly sixteen percent of[ global freshwater](http://waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf), is devoted to growing livestock. Furthermore, a third of worldwide[ grain production](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/044044/meta;jsessionid=5BD026EFAA22990E387DC2D579E5DC19.ip-10-40-1-98) is used to feed livestock. By 2050, consumption of meat and dairy products is expected to rise[ 76 and 64 percent respectively](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e03.pdf),  which will increase the resource burden from the industry. Cattle are  by far the biggest source of emissions from animal agriculture, with [one recent study showing](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.6b01006)  that in an average American diet, beef consumption creates 1,984 pounds  of CO2e annually. Replacing beef with plants would reduce that figure  96 percent, bringing it down to just 73 pounds of CO2e. ""

"" 

Animal agriculture specifically:

* Accounts for[ five percent](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e03.pdf) of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions;
* Represents[ 44 percent](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e03.pdf)  of anthropogenic methane emissions, the primary driver of  climate  change related to livestock, as methane is 34 times more potent than  carbon dioxide over 100 years;
* Comprises [44 percent](http://www.fao.org/3/i3437e/i3437e03.pdf) of all anthropogenic nitrous oxide emissions, the most potent GHG; and
* Makes up[ 75-80 percent](http://www.fao.org/climatechange/36143-0fa4483057747f41c08183b702ec5954e.pdf) of total agricultural emissions.""

0,"A huge thing to help sustainability and the environment would be for large businesses and organisations to recycle more!  Since Blue Planet II, plastic waste has been on everyone’s mind, but the biggest volume of waste produced by the average office by miles, is paper (60 – 80%!!)  And it’s generally the waste which can most easily be eliminated, or at least drastically reduced. We need to encourage businesses to utilize the hierarchy of waste much more: reduce (start by reducing your waste volume) &gt; reuse (try to reuse as much as possible) &gt; recycle (allow waste to be processed into other materials &amp; products) &gt; disposal - the last resort should be letting waste go to landfill!! 

Educate your staff and get them behind you, set up an easy to use bin system!

Your compliance obligations with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local agencies remain in effect for ongoing cleanups of contaminated sites under state and federal environmental laws. Office closures, work stoppages, state and federal government slowdowns, and supply-chain disruptions are making it hard to satisfy environmental obligations.

There are currently no federal mandates or executive orders requiring business shutdowns or mandatory quarantine. Many states, counties, and municipalities are releasing executive orders ranging from shelter-in-place to closing nonessential businesses and limiting gatherings of people. These state and local mandates exempt “essential businesses”. The “essential business” exemption includes services and sectors that promote public safety, health, and welfare. Are environmental cleanups and investigations “essential businesses” and if they are for how long will they remain “essential businesses”? Even if environmental cleanups are permitted to continue, maintaining the recommended “social distancing” in site investigation or remediation activities presents a challenge.

### What can you do?

**Manage critical compliance staff.**  Create a social distancing plan for your staff and make sure it is adhered to. Schedule regular conference calls to address concerns and help prevent compliance gaps. Come up with a succession plan that will kick in if critical personnel are sidelined by illness.

**Consider the use of outside consultants.** Don’t be short-sighted when trying to manage compliance reporting. Using partner firms and  even retired employees to help supplement strained internal resources is better than failed compliance.

**Avoid late reporting**. Submit reports on time even if there are some concerns over usual quality control and results. You can resubmit or amend these reports as needed when the crisis point passes.

**Contact the EPA and state agency to extend deadlines.** The COVID-19 pandemic may reduce your ability to complete cleanup, routine sampling, and meet reporting deadlines. Work with responsible parties on an individualized basis to determine whether ongoing work can continue and the extent to which deadlines should be extended, and follow a dispute process in the event of disagreement.

Circumstances are changing almost daily. You may have facilities in different states that may be subject to different orders from local or state governments. Be prepared to adjust your compliance plan as circumstances change and coordinate with your regulator(s) as needed.Environmental Investigations and Cleanups During the COVID-19"

We need Governor Ron DeSantis to execute an order to freeze all Rent, Mortgages, Bills for all Floridians who don't have thousands of dollars in their bank accounts and depend on every dollar, live paycheck to paycheck, to make ends meet. The bills are being extended to 60 days instead of being frozen so no one has to pay bills that continue to accumulate when Floridians need to focus on getting back on their feet. The State shouldn't be charging tolls making millions on the hour when all monies must be allocated for necessities. States like CA, NY, MN, and others their governors are stepping up and providing relief to their residents by exercising their power to do the right thing.

The time is NOW, not tomorrow, we need an effective Governor to take action when it's needed.

### Why is this important?

Our goal for this petition is to help all of Floridians during the Corona Virus outbreak who are facing hardship such as immobilization due to hospitalization, sickness, being laid off without severance package or permitted to use PTO. The businesses receive government relief before its people- leaving people vulnerable.

The tl:dr is that ethical brands are drowning in a $280B yearly advertising spend from large consumer brands (namely the Coca-Colas, P&amp;Gs, or Unilevers of the world), and I'd love to help even the playing field; you know, because we only have one planet earth. My initial approach was to build a mailing list and feature the five coolest ethical brands every week. As it turns out (thanks to your recommendations), there are way more ethical brands than I can feature in a weekly email. To remedy this I to built out a chrome extension to feature a higher frequency of brands in the new tab screen for those interested.

There's some pretty big interest here and I’m experimenting with two next steps. I'd love your feedback on which one would be more interesting.

* A credit system. Every day you have the extension installed you gain credits, which can be spent at the ethical retailers we feature.
* An in-browser ethical alternative recommendation system. During say, an amazon checkout; overlay ethical alternatives to what you're about to purchase. For example, if you're shopping for a Calvin Klein T-shirt, suggest a similar Pact shirt instead (wearpact.com).

Do either of these features sound useful? Which one should I spend time on?

An effort should be made to make the information easy to understand and speak to people emotionally. Academics often completely lose the public when explaining concepts, because they rely too heavily on statistics, jargon and generally things that make the general person bored. 


Emphasis should be made on how global warming affects people, their families, their every day life and what people generally value. Ex: travel destinations (remember Notre Dam), food, sweets and beverages etc.

- Unprecedented ET outreach for the survival of the people of Earth 

- Avoid airplanes, ships, mass transportation, crowds

- Stay at home to avoid exposing yourself to risk of infection

- Real number of infections and deaths much higher than reported

- Actual incubation period up to four weeks to 3 months

- Spread by asymptomatic people; through air, breath, clothing, etc. 

- Breathing masks useless, virus penetrates because so small 

- Full-body protective suit, breathing apparatus only real protection

- Hermetic quarantine required, must be longer than 2 weeks

- Asian races initially most susceptible but will spread to others

- Virus becomes more aggressive over time, claiming more lives

- Children mainly immune, main hidden spreaders of disease* 

- China, US, etc., suppressed truth for political and economic reasons

- The WHO culpable for not immediately proclaiming pandemic risk

It is a part of Nilgiri biosphere reserve and is now under the consideration for recognition as a heritage site. The park is filled with waterfalls, hills, valleys, streams and forests. The park is famous for its rich population of animals and birds.  


The park is located to the north west of Karnataka’s Nagarhole national park. The two parks are separated by the Kabini reservoir. The park gets its name from the streams. Naga means snake and hole means streams. Many wriggling streams are found in this park and, thus the name. The park has 47 streams, 41 artificial tanks, four lakes with water throughout the year, 4 perennial streams, a reservoir and a dam. There are several swamps in this region. This diverse landscape promotes the population of various species of animals and birds in this region  


Nagarhole national park has the highest density of herbivores in Asia. This park is best for spotting Black panther, elephants, guar, tiger and bear..

### Different Areas in the Park

The park is located in a place where the Deccan plateau joins with the Western Ghats. The park’s altitude ranges from 680m to 1,454m.

David Attenborough says a global agreement to end harmful fisheries subsidies is possible. The 164 member governments of the World Trade Organization have pledged to reach a deal before 2020.

These subsidies, worth tens of billions in public money, are keeping destructive fishing activities afloat. They enable large industrial fishing boats to fish, even when fish stocks could collapse. They make it harder for small-scale fishermen to thrive and contribute to illegal fishing.

I just noticed something else, the stats being compared are misleading.
With influenza, we typically calculate the death rates based on  deaths per 100,000 people.  With this bug they are calculating the death rates based on total infected/hospitalized vs total dead.   Not the same comparison
Using this https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm source as my basis.

If we take total deaths low end  22,000 divided by 370,000 you get  .059 or 5.9%; and the high numbers 55,000 deaths by 670,000 .082 or 8.2%.   Sample size is a mother of all stats.

The Cov is being stated as 3-5% mortality yet this is for those who go to the hospital and get tested.

We are all becoming much more aware of our impacts on the environment, and there is a lot of talk about how to cut down plastic use, slow down fast fashion, and alternative fuels for cars. Well, i'm here to let you know that there is one plant that could be the answer to all of these problems, and more!

&amp;#x200B;

**That plant is hemp.**

&amp;#x200B;

Hemp is being dubbed by many as a ""super plant"", and ""the most sustainable fibre on the planet"", and we sure think this could be

“Hemp. Aka the most versatile plant on the planet. Hemp is the only plant that can [feed you](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/add-hemp-seeds-to-every-meal-for-protein-nutritional-benefits), clothe you, create a home for you, and provide you with [natural beauty products](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/science-backed-benefits-of-hemp).”Source: MindBodyGreen.org

So first, I want to tell you what it can't be used for...

To get high.

That's right, despite the stigma around Hemp. It's a different type of the cannabis plant to the one used to make marijuana. There's next to no THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) in the Hemp plant therefore it cannot be used for this purpose.

Hemp cultivation is becoming more widespread, and as more hemp is grown, it is becoming a highly regarded resource to help make the world a more sustainable and eco friendly place.  Hemp is super multifunctional and has proved itself one of the most versatile natural fibres out there. Here's a list of current and up and coming uses for the super plant:

“Hemp has been cultivated on planet earth for over 10,000 years. It has been an important source of food and fibre with references dating back to ancient China and Mesopotamia. Applications of hemp plants evolved from simple rope and coarse woven fabric to paper and sail cloth.” Source : HempTrade.ca

Did you know? As a farmer in parts of the USA in the 1600s, it was actually mandatory to grow Hemp on a percentage of your land. Each farmer had to dedicate land specifically to Hemp because it was so widely used. This sadly changed when the government ruled it an illegal plant due to its association with the cannabis plant.

**Clothes** \- Yup. Brands such as Hempton Apparel are now bringing out hemp clothing, it is perfect for clothes because is is durable, resistant to odour, UV protective, breathable, comfy, and moisture wicking. 

**Hemp oil** \- Hemp oil has many uses and benefits, people swear by it. In fact, it has started to become so popular in Australia, there have been cases of it selling out and being hard to get hold of. Hemp oil contains Omega 3 and Omega 6 which are said to help inflammation, so many people with arthritis are using it.

**Hemp moisturiser** and skin care - Hemp is used in face moisturisers, and even to help with the aging process, and help treat acne.

**Nutrition** \- Hemp seeds are becoming routine in the diets of many health conscious people. Why? It is great protein (popular in vegans and vegetarians), it also contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty oils, Omega 9, Minerals (Calcium, Iron, Magnesium), and Vitamins.

**Food** \- Not only can you get hemp seeds, and hearts, but people are starting to experiment with hemp in food more, such as Hemp burgers!

**Hemp milk** \- Yup. There’s a new contender for non dairy milk. Hemp milk is pretty darn good for you too. It is lactose, soy, and gluten free and high in fatty acids and proteins. It is very nutritious, and people have even started making it themselves at home.

**Hempcrete** \- Hemp has been used as a replacement for concrete for many years as I found out last year, and is now becoming increasingly in demand.

I’m certainly no expert in hempcrete, concrete or any other elements of construction, so here's a bit on hempcrete from a far more knowledgeable source:

“It has **great** energy efficiency. It maintains a steady temperature. It doesn't shrink, so there are no crack lines. It is a breathable material.”  Source: Houseplanninghelp.com

**Rope** \- One of the oldest uses for hemp, possibly the original.  Hemp has been used in rope in all kinds of trades, but is famous for its uses in shipping.

“In 1997, a **hemp rope dating back** to 26900 BC was found in Czechoslovakia, making it the oldest known object to be associated with cannabis.” Source: Ancient Origins

**Soap** \- Hemp is known to be gentle on sensitive skin, as well as being moisturising, so it makes the perfect ingredient for natural soap.

**Fuel** \- Hemp biofuel is being discussed as a possibility. As we are becoming more conscious and trying to remove the use of fossil fuels, scientists are looking for a way to make an environmentally and sustainable fuel, and hemp is being talked about a lot right now, so watch this space!

**Sunscreen** \- With it’s natural UV protection properties, and it's moisturising feeling, it has started to be used in making sunscreen, and with much less harmful ingredients, compared with some other options on the market.

**Beer** \- Heck yes. Hemp beer is on the market. Gluten free, vegan friendly beer with hemp in it. Because, why not?!

**Pet food** \- Because we can’t keep this hemp goodness all to ourselves - It’s great for our pets too! There is currently cat and dog food enriched with hemp oil, and some brands have been recommended by vets.

**Pet bedding -** A safe, natural option for pet bedding, which offers comfort as well as antimicrobial properties.

**Paper** \- Hemp paper has been around for years - in fact it can be traced back to around 200 BC in China.

***Interesting Fact:***

The first draft of the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.

**Protein powder** \-  I must admit, nutrition definitely isn't one of my expertise so I looked over a few websites to learn a bit more about this. Turns out hemp protein powder is meant to be pretty good.

**“Hemp protein powder** is a high-quality plant-based protein that contains 20 amino acids — the building blocks of protein. Protein is crucial for developing, growing and maintaining muscles, tissues and vital organs. It also helps boost metabolism and increases fat-burning.” Yoursuper.com

**Nappies/diapers** \- Hemp nappies for babies are becoming a big thing. The main reasons hemp is so good for diapers are; It is environmentally friendly (we already know this), it’s baby friendly - the fabric is tested and certified to be safe to use on young babies and children, it’s durable, it’s soft, it’s stretchy, and it’s absorbent.

**To clean soil -** I talked about this in a post recently, but it's a valid one for this list, and I love talking about it, because I just think it’s so wonderful. Hemp produces high quantities of biomass, which returns to the soil and decomposes, giving nutrients back into the soil.  Not only that but it also is also able to absorb heavy metals and pollutants (Phytovolatilization).  An example of this is:

Hemp was used to help clean up after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in  Ukraine in 1986, due to its ability to absorb radioactive toxins from the ground.

**Shoes -** This is quite a new thing as far as I can tell, but i’ve seen a couple of brands of sneakers coming out with hemp trainers, as a vegan, and sustainable option. I'm excited for this idea though, and can't wait to get a pair myself.

**Plastic -** This is beginning to be talked about. The idea of plastic being replaced with ‘bioplastics’, including hemp as one of the runners. I really believe this is just the beginning for hemp, it’s a fibre that has a highly growing market, and now you know why. You’ll be hearing about hemp a lot more in future.  Hopefully it really can help to turn this environmental crisis around, because its negative impacts are generally much less than current material we are overusing.

Pretty impressive hey? If you know of any other uses for this magnificent plant, please comment below, I'd love to hear of any others you may have.

**Cars** \- Believe it or not, this is actually a piece of history, which may well make a comeback. Henry Ford made a prototype hemp car back in 1941, which was also designed to run on hemp fuel. If you read up, it seems that it may also become a thing of the future... I think Mr Ford was definitely well ahead of his time there, and onto something. Time will tell.

I have just made my own brand of hemp shirts, which I am currently crowdfunding to help get off the ground.  They are available now on Kickstarter, check out the link to snap one up at our Kickstarter prices (only a few left at the $20USD price tag ) Follow this link to grab one before they go full price!

MarinaTex doesn’t leach toxins into the environment, it’s stronger than a standard plastic bag, can be used in a variety of packaging and can even be eaten. The waste from one Atlantic Cod can produce 1,400 bags.

23-year-old Lucy was studying product design at the University of Sussex when she started the project as a way to tackle waste in the fishing industry, which produces 50 million tonnes of fishy by-products every year. Lucy hopes MarinaTex could replace much of the world’s single-use plastic.Bio plastic from fish that breaks down in 6 weeks created by student"

0,"In short, Algae gardens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that there are individual corporations that are attempting to crate algae products that remove CO2 from the atmosphere like [this one](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/can-an-algae-powered-lamp-quench-our-thirst-for-energy-3509307/). And there are DIY plans for ""[scrubbers](https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Algae-Home-CO2-Scrubber-Part-1/)"" available over the internet to purify the air in localized areas. But I had a slightly different take on the idea. Instead of trying to make a large multi purpose device like the scientists in the first article, or a home brew item like the second; Maybe people would be interested in growing algae as a hobby. 

There are two aspects to consider; The utility, and the aesthetic. On the side of utility, algae is better at converting CO2 into O2 than any terrestrial plant I am aware of by volume. [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4978769/) stated that under ideal circumstances, scientists were able to convert 1 gram of CO2, per liter of algae solution, per day. Now, one gram per day does not sound like much. But that is only for a single liter of fluid. Now, the smallest recommended fish tank for most freshwater fish is 10 gal, or about 38 Liters. So, that is 38 grams removed per day. That means per year 13,870 grams would be removed person who forms a tank. Now let's say that other people like the idea and get involved. There are 659 thousand people on this sub reddit. So let's say that under ideal circumstances, one thousand people see my post, like it, and since we are all stuck inside anyway decide to give it a try, and stick with it through the year. That would mean that instead of grams, we would be removing almost 14,000 KILOGRAMS of CO2 from the atmosphere. Of course this is just a drop in the bucket. But it is a nice drop. 

There is also the aesthetic to consider. Not only could growing an Aagae garden be something a person does for the environment, it can also be a hobby. by manipulating conditions inside the tank, people could compare online to see who is able to get the highest algae density, or the highest conversion rate. But more importantly by experimenting with lighting, or different strains of algae including those  that grow in different colors, or are bioluminescent, people could make living works of art. 

I am well aware of the holes in my idea. Could it ever be a major way to combat climate change? Probably not. There are more problems than just CO2, and it would take an insane amount of people to participate in order to make any kind of noticeable difference. Furthermore, my estimates are entirely hypothetical. So while my numbers might sound nice, it would be almost impossible to verify how much of an effect any group large than a single garden or group of gardens would have. But, with all that being said, it could be a nice reminder to ourselves and to those who see it that we need to be acting toward the benefit of our planet, and there are worse ways to do that than a potentially pretty piece of art.

0,"I've noticed that as restaurants have had to shift to a takeout-only model, people have felt compelled to continue to give business to these places in the hope that they will survive the current situation. This is great. HOWEVER... the amount of single-use, non-recyclable trash being produced as a result of this really disheartens me. So many places use the cheapest, most convenient plastic possible, wrap it all in a big plastic bag, while people take the food less than a mile where they consume and dump it all in the garbage. 

As an example: The other night, my wife and went to Bruster's Ice Cream, which has switched to only operating via drive-thru. We paid for and received our ice cream; instead of the usual paper cup and plastic spoon, was delivered with big plastic lids and handed to us in a plastic bag. Like many other people, we simply consumed the ice cream in the parking lot, and then threw all that trash away in their nearby bin. It was completely unnecessary to produce that much garbage, but that's just how their drive-thru delivery works.

This model, if we assume people will continue to patronize restaurants at the same pre-Covid-crisis levels, will create an order of magnitude more trash and that saddens me. There has to be a better way.So much take-out, so much trash."
0,"There's a major difference between what would be involved in a rapid response to climate change as opposed to what we are seeing with the response to COVID-19. A rapid response to climate change will not happen because it's not economically nor politically advantageous to the current power structure. However, the response to the pandemic is a gift to those with wealth and power. Everyone should be very concerned about the invasive and authoritarian techniques that will now be employed in the name of defending against viral outbreaks. For example, check out [this recent article in the MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615370/coronavirus-pandemic-social-distancing-18-months/) where the author speculates about what transportation and socialization will look like in the aftermath of this pandemic experience:  


&gt; We don’t know exactly what this new future  looks like, of course. But one can imagine a world in which, to get on a  flight, perhaps you’ll have to be signed up to a service that tracks  your movements via your phone. The airline wouldn’t be able to see where  you’d gone, but it would get an alert if you’d been close to known  infected people or disease hot spots. There’d be similar requirements at  the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport  hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your  workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature  or other vital signs. 

You'll notice there's no talk about scaling back flights, instead, it's about *getting back to normal*. Of course, that new normal will be a continuation of the same plus additional security measures in which everyone is first and foremost a potential disease vector. This is the viral version of the post-9/11 security response where we get the security theater of the TSA. Now, not only will your sweat get you a pat down at the airport but your temperature might get you put in a special quarantine with all your movements being tracked by these high-modern technological ""solutions.""   


[The pandemic we are experiencing is good for the environment](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/the-unexpected-impact-of-a-pandemic-on-the-environment-/) and that should be an eye-opener for everyone. Addressing global warming will require a sacrifice of normality and anthropocentrism and that sacrifice would need to be religious (think John 3:16 level of sacrifice... For humanity so loved the world...). What this virus has done is the opposite though, anthropocentrism is front and center as the highest moral value for humanity. The linguistic framing of the pandemic has been in terms of warfare, ""we are at war"" they will say. That war is between humanity and a virus, two separate things. This is still the ideology of ""man versus nature"" that got us to where we are. The response to the pandemic will be a reinforcement and entrenchment of the belief in the human right to pillage and destroy all other forms of life (or non-life) due to the supposed superiority of human beings. As long as anthropocentrism remains the dominant moral approach to non-human life and as long as the old guard continues to hold the reins, we will only see meaningless measures to address global warming [while the wealthy continue to hoard and plan their survival](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/disease-dodging-worried-wealthy-jet-off-to-disaster-bunkers) in the inevitable collapse from cascading environmental catastrophes.   


In sum, we can get mass mobilization to deal with the pandemic because it reinforces anthropocentrism while serving the interests of wealth and power. We can't get it for global warming because it requires abandoning anthropocentrism and it's disadvantageous to the old guard that has benefited from global capitalism.Why we won't see a rapid response to global warming even though this pandemic response suggests that we could have one"

Hello Science world! From February 18 - February 23, a massive fire burned at a scrap metal recycling facility in Becker, MN. Google ""Northern Metals Fire Becker"" to read more about the incident.

The place that caught fire is super shady. They weren't even fully operational when the fire broke out. They had just moved to town after being forced to shut down their plant in Minneapolis for falsifying pollution records. We know the cars were not stripped of tires, so rubber was burning. We also now know that the fire likely started from a missed battery igniting. So... batteries were burning. The whole situation is very sketchy, from the lack of pre-incident planning by local authorities, to the terms they made with the city of Becker to move to town, to the emergency response by the state, and the cleanup afterwards. A group of citizens created this alliance to try and get answers - about 200 of us total, and about 10 in the small planning group. We finally were provided with the test results from storm water and ash samples collected near the site of the fire yesterday. The results are public record (per Minnesota Pollution Control). Can any of you take a look at the results in the link below and tell us if anything here is of concern to public health? I couldn't figure out how to upload a PDF to reddit. Thank you

I am a 2nd year Graduate School of Management student, the best business school in Russia, ranked #23 in Financial Times ranking.

And I really need your help! Currently my team is working on the project trying to tackle the problem of deforestation in Australia. We have one really neat solution we would like to introduce in our project: seedballs. These are seeds of different plant species covered in coal dust. In Kenya, they are spread all around by planes, thus providing the lands with an effective solution for deforestation. You can find more on this by following the link: http://www.seedballskenya.com/

We would LOVE to use the experience of this company in Australia, but we lack information on whether it is worth it. We tried to search the Internet looking for answers to our questions, but it was no use. That is why we decided to ask Australians, because obviously there cannot be any better source of information about Australia :)

We are interested in the following questions:

1) Is this seedballs thing being used to fight deforestation in Australia right now? If yes, could you please share any link(s) to companies doing that?

2) There is a list of plant species Seedballs Kenya is using as their source of seeds. You can find the list here: http://www.seedballskenya.com/species-info/4594445434. The question is: do you know of a way to check whether these plants are subject to any biodiversity restrictions in Austalia? We would like to know if it is possible to export these plants/seeds from Kenya and import them to Australia.

3) Do you know of any plants in Australia that CAN be used as a source for seedballs in Australia? It should not necessarily be included into the list of species used by Kenya Seedballs. But if such a species grows in Australia, then it is just another way around the biodiversity restrictions.

We would be really happy if someone happens to know ANY info on the topic and especially any information related to the questions above.

Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan discusses the sewage problem facing India. Urban areas produce 120,000 tonnes of fecal sludge on a daily basis, but an estimated two-thirds of the country’s households with toilets aren’t connected to the sewer system.

One city, however, is turning the tide. 

In the Indian city of Patna, 90% of homes have toilets, but just one in five is connected to the sewer system. Two-thirds of homes flush their waste into septic tanks and pay trucks to collect it. Many of these trucks then dump the waste in the open, where it contaminates drinking water, causing cholera, dysentery and diarrhea.

So Patna took a different approach, non-profit PSI negotiated for the private trucks to dumb waste at the city’s unused waste treatment sites for processing.

PSI also opened a free helpline that the public can call for advice on which of the private dump trucks were safe and reliable.

So far 8 million litres of fecal sludge waste have been safely collected.Way of Solving India’s sewage problem"

0,"***Where animals are being held, killed and eaten, outbreaks of diseases are destined to happen.***   The animals at farms are usually held in awful conditions, they live   most of their lives in confined spaces and in unsanitary areas. Apart   from the  ethical concerns of animal farms, this is actually a **very bad idea regarding our own health**, too!^(\[1\])

As   it turns out, the breeding, slaughtering and consumption of other   animals is one major source of a number of diseases which pose a threat   to humans. Numerous diseases can be transmitted from animals to humans   (and vice-versa). This type of disease is called a **Zoonosis** and includes HIV, Ebola, Malaria, MERS and Tuberculosis.\[3\] One infamous example is the **SARS pandemic of 2003**, which likely originated from civets consumed by humans.^(\[1\])

The outbreak of **SARS-CoV-2**   of the ongoing pandemic is also linked to the consumption and trade of   animals. Researches have proposed that the endangered Pangolin could  be  behind the.^(\[2,3\]) A possible  explanation could be that the disease  was transmitted from bats to  Pangolins, which were being hunted and  sold in China.

***Antimicrobial resistance***

Animal farming, especially in factory farms, is **also a main driver of antimicrobial resistance** of many infectious microbes, including bacterial pathogens.^(\[2,4,5\])

This is a major issue and could lead to an extreme crisis in the future.\[7\]   Antibiotics have given us the possibility to treat many critical   diseases easily. When they stop working, we could face significant   consequences, as diseases such as Tuberculosis, Pneumonia or Sepsis   would become much harder to treat.

Alternative   solutions are under way, but resistant pathogens are already  developing  at an alarming rate. Recent studies have been alarming. For  example,  the WHO estimates that by 2050, up to 10,000,000 million  people could  die of resistant ""superbugs"".^(\[13\])

In the EU, more than 25,000 people die **every year** from an infection that is resistant to all antimicrobials.^(\[5\]) In the US, there are 2 million cases of illnesses **anually** caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Worldwide, the number of casualties is estimated to be at least 700,000.^(\[8\])

There are **two ways in which livestock and animal breeding contribute** to widespread **antimicrobial resistance**:

1. Farm   animals harbor various microbes and parasites, some of which can be   spread to humans. At the same time, excessive amounts of anti-microbial   drugs are being used to treat diseases common in farm animals. This   combined results in major pathogens developing resistances to the drugs   that are typically used on them.
2. Antibiotics used in animals end up in waste water, dirt and fertilizer and eventually will enter the natural environment. This can affect farm workers, local residents or consumers of produce or meat.

A study from 2007 in the Netherlands found that, from 540 pig in nine slaughterhouses, roughly 39 % carried [MRSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus) bugs that were resistant to [tetracycline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline) or even multiple antibiotic drugs.^(\[12\])

Given these issues, we should definitely reconsider the way we breed and use   animals for human consumption. If we were to abandon animal products   completely, we could potentially prevent a large number of diseases,   epidemics and future health crisis - however it is unlikely that this will happen in the near future. *Still, we should definitely find ways to reduce the number of animals we consume and how we can improve their living conditions.*

0,"I am not one for reading directions. So, when making a pound of pasta, I bring 4 to 5 cups of water to a simmer, add pasta, bring to a boil, turn off heat and cover. In 10 minutes (or less if you want al dente) a good portion, if not all, of the water has been soaked up. Last week my husband wanted to help me make some pasta and started reading the directions. When he said, ""Bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil,"" I thought he misread it. He didn't. Are you kidding me? The wasted time, water and energy to bring a gallon of water to a boil? The next time I went to the store (before the panic) I looked at all the different brands and all the directions had the same amount of water for one pound. They are all contributing to such a waste.

0,"So in modern society we have farmers grow crops that utilise the soil nutrients and over time sap the soil of all necessary nutrients, real big problem.
At home we then proceed to throw these fruit and vegge scraps etc into the bin to create another problem in landfill.

This is my idea, the government invests in a program where the community is all supplied with a compost bin to go with their rubbish bins. Home owners are then encouraged to 'Donate to the Farmers' (a cause that is very popular for Aussies) with their food scraps. Kids would be taught how to compost in school with a school compost program (some schools already do this), advertising campaigns to encourage the support our farmers which our economy relies on partially. 
These scraps are then trucked out in bulk to farms. Farmers would happily accept free compost or even manure from my personal experience as someone who grew up in a coastal/rural area. 

City people don't realise the value of their waste that we are currently using to create more damage to the land with landfill. Most people in the country collect scraps for the garden or the chickens that provide organic high quality eggs for the family. We live in a wasteful society.

0,"Hi,

I am doing extensive research on climate change and pollution. I am still asking myself many questions. Gunter Pauli says ""we don't need to pollute less but stop polluting"".

Considering that sun cycles are not responsible for climate change but human activity is, don't we have to change our way of life entirely ?

Any human production generates CO2. Is carbon neutrality really efficient to balance CO2 in the atmosphere and prevent global warming ? Don't we really need to stop generating CO2 and not only be ""carbon neutral"" ?

Thanks, I tried to keep my thoughts concise.Pollution free world"

'Agroforestry for me is one ecosystem to produce sustainable products today, tomorrow and also in the future.'

15 years ago Alexander Retana took over his father’s farm in Costa Rica. The farm consisted of open rice fields, with minimal biodiversity. He started planting trees to give himself shade in the baking summer months but soon found that he was creating a new ecosystem above his head. Integrating the jungle with his farm didn’t just increase biodiversity, it increased precipitation and helped more moisture stay in the soil, so it’s good for his crops and the planet.Saving the jungle by growing food in it"

0,"With many of us looking ahead at lots of indoor time as we await the passage of the Coronavirus, I'm looking for recommendations for some of your best reads. I'm not looking for Coronavirus/pandemic material - there's plenty of that going around.

Instead, I'm looking for excellent writing on anything related to the environment - topics large &amp; small; important &amp; whimsical. I'm pretty well versed in many of our environmental challenges, and am feeling fairly bleak about the state of affairs. So I'm less interested in accounts of our current crisis designed to educate the layman &amp; shock us into action. Instead, I'm looking for hopeful and solution-oriented narratives. (That said, if there's a very important but bleak read that I've missed, I'll take it on.)

My favorite topics:

- Landscape/ecosystem restoration
- Wildlife, ecology tales, keystone species
- Ocean conservation
- Sustainable economy
- Permaculture/regenerative agriculture
- Energy transition
- Climate change adaptation/smart planning
- Simple adventure/experiential stories deeply involved in natural settings
- Just all-around excellent science writing

Examples that spring to mind:

- American Buffalo, Steven Rinella. 2 interwoven storylines: history of near-extermination &amp; recovery, and bison hunting trip in Alaska.
- Secret Knowledge of Water, Craig Childs. Beautiful, evocative writing of water in the desert; delicate ecosystems. Science &amp; wonder.
- Cradle to Cradle, Michael Braungart and William McDonough. How to design a circular, sustainable durable goods economy.
- Stranger in the Forest, Eric Hansen. Belief-stretching tale of a westerner learning the ways of near-solo travel in the Borneo forest.
- The Wild Trees, Richard Preston. Initial explorations by adventurous researchers of the extreme ecology of the world's tallest trees.

Less compelling recent reads:
- I'm guessing that I'll be referred to The Overstory (Richard Powers), and while it was nice bit of ecology embedded into the storytelling it didn't feel very solutions-oriented. I expected &gt;!a hopeful outcome, but instead it mirrored the bleakness of our present situation,!&lt; which I already feel very informed about.

 Tracy studies climate-induced ecological transformation. In other words, how climate change is causing ecosystems to change into new ones, really rapidly – and how to manage those transformations with a lens towards global biodiversity conservation. She uses a changing grassland on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, as a case study for stewarding ecological transformation. Specifically, she takes a look at what is living in the grassland using Next Generation Sequencing, and rapid biodiversity plots. She also measures tree rings for native and non-native trees throughout the peninsula (it’s about 6 million acres). 

Tracy has also taught a study abroad about climate change to Fiji. She is part of the Women in Nature Network and the Nature Conservancy, Michigan Chapter, and she got Masters in Science at MSU studying turtles.Cool radio/podcast episode about Climate Change in Alaska by The Sci-Files"

0,"We need to surrender in front of the nature.

We are made by nature, just like any other animal species, we are built to depend on the nature, which we are, we are trying too hard to get out of this dependency, but actually we don't have any other option, we can't live without the nature.

But it's not like we are enslaved, we get everything we need, in fact everything we want, it's beautiful, it's caring but still after developing a little bit we have started to feel like that we deserve more control, but over what? The nature? We are just fool enough to think like that.
It's out of our reach to ever be able to control anything related to nature, and it will always be.

The biggest example of human Idiocracy is that we can save the nature? Lol, the nature doesn't need saving, we do, we don't need saving the nature, it's way more powerful than we think.

I believe the nature has a reset button, and we are getting ever more close to press it. It works like if we start destroying natural balance and continue it, the more we destroy it the more unbalanced the nature becomes and more unsustainable for us, if we break a certain threshold, we will just be wiped out but the planet will remain, it won't explode into pieces, after thousands or maybe millions of years later something new will begin, but we won't be there.

The rate at which we are consuming natural resources, we may have few hundreds or at most a thousand years left before we will finish everything, we are planning to go and live on different planet, but mark my word, humans will never find a permanent home, there is only one home and it is this one, if we can't live here permanently then we can't live anywhere else, we will simply destroy wherever we go, we are even wasting natural resources on fighting amongst ourselves imaginary wars that shouldn't even exist.
 
All our problems we have created only. We are simply greedy and we want more while we need very less to survive and live a good life.

But if we live by the rules of nature then we can live here as long as this planet exist, we get three most needed things for free from nature i.e. food, water, air, yes, food, even though we need to pay for it but it is because someone else is producing it for us.

We are capable of protecting ourselves from all other species on this planet and that should be enough for our survival.

We don't need to go back and live in the caves, but we need to slow down this madness whose ultimate goal is to run away from here.

We need to surrender, we need to accept we are not superior, we are not powerful, we are merely alive by the mercy of our creator, this nature.


PS. All this things was going through my mind after this global outbreak of coronavirus and how we have bow down in front of germs only.

I love nature and respects it, and I hate it when ungrateful people talk about how they are going to save nature, it makes me laugh.We need to surrender."

Written Essay:

Many nations are loudly boasting about their pledges to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Countries including the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand have all legally committed to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, with Sweden committing to 2045 and Norway to just 2030 [1]. Carbon neutrality means that a nation absorbs as much CO2 from the atmosphere as they emit from burning fossil fuels and other sources. These are noble ambitions, and are desperately needed. But there is one historically isolated country which overwhelmingly outperforms nearly every other nation, by not only being carbon neutral, but carbon negative [2]. This country is The Kingdom of Bhutan. Carbon negative means that this nation is actually a net absorber of CO2. However, they are suffering from the effects of climate change, watch till the end to find out why.

Bhutan is a small country located in the Eastern Himalayas, with landscapes ranging from lush subtropical plains in the south to vast mountains in the north. Aside from its natural beauty, Bhutan is also a unique country politically. In the 1970’s, the King of Bhutan famously proposed a Gross National Happiness index as the key metric for its country’s success. This lead to a holistic philosophical approach to social development, cultural preservation and environmental sustainability that results in Bhutan often being cited as the happiest country on Earth. At the time, the King famously said that “The Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross Domestic Product” or (GDP); a vastly different focus to most other countries, who use GDP, the measure of the economic wealth of a country, as the main indicator of success. [3], [13].   

Bhutan was previously solely governed by a Monarchy, but in 2008, the King imposed a new constitution, and enforced a multi-party democracy [4], with national happiness at the forefront of its decision making. This was done without pressure from Bhutan’s citizens, who were already very happy with their monarchy. However, the king saw the benefits of imposing a democractic system and reducing his level of control over the Kingdom, even allowing the potential for his own impeachment.

With respect to environmentalism, the constitution states that the nation’s forest cover must never fall below 60%, but Bhutan currently exceeds this, at 72%. [5] Bhutan’s annual carbon footprint is around 2.2 million tons, but due to their exceptional forest cover, the county absorbs around 6 million tons of carbon emissions per year, nearly three times as much as it emits! All forests are also strongly protected by laws which prohibit poaching, hunting, mining and pollution in these areas. Fixed biological corridors also provide pathways between protected areas of forest to its diverse wildlife [5]. 

To reduce pollution, the government gives free electricity to all farmers, which mitigates emissions associated with burning firewood. A large amount of this electricity is generated through hydroelectric systems in the dense array of rivers running through the country’s landscape. This not only powers the majority of Bhutan, but some is also exported, offsetting a further 6 million tons of carbon in neighboring countries [5].They also provide significant subsidies on LED lighting, and maintain a key partnership with Nissan, to promote electric vehicle use. Bhutan has even implemented bans on plastic bags, fast food, smoking, timber exports, hunting and mass tourism [8], [13], [16].

In addition to its government, Bhutan’s citizens also act as environmental stewards. In 2016, the Bhutanese celebrated the birth of the new prince by planting 108,000 trees, a simultaneous environmental and religious sentiment as, in Buddhism, trees symbolise long life, health, beauty and compassion. [6]

Whilst Bhutan’s environmental efforts are extremely impressive, it is a very small nation, with a population of around 750,000. For context, it’s nearest neighbours China and India have populations of around 1.44 and 1.37 billion, and annual emission of 11 and 2.5 trillion tonnes of carbon respectively, the 1st and 3rd highest carbon dioxide emissions globally [2-4], meaning China emits 500,000 times as much as Bhutan. 

But in addition to acting as a carbon store, Bhutan is also extremely focused on the health of its fresh water systems. Bhutan is part of The Tibetan Plateau, a massive glacial region covering mainly Tibet in China but also Bhutan, India and several other countries. The region contains so much fresh water that it is sometimes referred to as the third pole. It feeds at least 10 major river systems across Asia and provides water to 1.3 billion people. But it is not a desire for fresh water which led Bhutan to become leaders in sustainable water management, in fact it is a desire to reduce the volume of freshwater flow into the country. But why is this?
 
Just like the other poles, The Tibetan Plateau is suffering from the effects of climate change [8]. A study using satellite images showed that just over 23% of Bhutan glaciers were lost from 1980-2010 [9]. Another showed that just a 1 degree celsius increase in Bhutan’s average temperature would result in a further 25% loss to its glaciers [8]. Currently, some of Bhutan’s glaciers are receding at up to 76 meters every year [8] contributing to rising levels in reservoir lakes and increased risk of flooding. On October 7th, 1994, a major burst in the Luggye Tsho (“looga cho”) glacial lake resulted in a massive flood causing damage to homes and farmland as well as the deaths of 21 people [10], [11], [14]. But this should never have happened. The Luggye Tsho lake didn’t even exist until the 1960s, it was previously a glacier. And this event was one of the main drivers for Bhutan's focus on environmental stewardship [13]. 

Bhutan is not a rich country, nor has it chosen to pursue rapid technological development, instead focusing on the happiness of its people. Hence, its ability to predict and recover from natural disasters is limited. Further, highly unpredictable earthquakes or avalanches could  cause flooding in the future with little to no warning [14]. However, the world has heard Bhutan’s cries and the UN, WWF, the Austrian Government and several other wealthy donors have stepped in to help mitigate the impacts of its melting glaciers.

So far, collaborators have installed early flood warning systems and begun to identify which of the country’s 983 glaciers and 2,794 glacial lakes are most at risk of flooding [13]. This has enabled Bhutan to begin work on at least 25 safe spillways which allow excess water to flow safely away from the overburdened lakes and dams [8]. Impressively, due to concerns over access and weight of heavy machinery, these spillways are being built using only manual labour and hand tools [10], [11]. 

It’s a cruel twist of fate that the first carbon negative country should suffer such extreme effects of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) believes this kind of glacial melting has been occurring globally since as far back as 1850. As well as floods, glacial melts contribute to rising sea-levels and reduced fresh water availability [12]. But Bhutan is adapting to our changing world and has even utilised glacial melt water to power its vast hydro-electricity program [14]. The power generated has seen Bhutan become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, with 8% of GDP and around 40% of exports coming from hydropower [8], [16]. Although, hydro developments have been met with some hostility from a small percentage of the population who see the dams as unnatural.

Bhutan acts as a shining example for other countries to follow. Their policies allowed the country to maintain its cultural identity, prioritise the happiness of its people, and protect their natural environment. Of course Bhutan is a small, low impact country; however, there’s no reason other countries cannot adopt more humanitarian and environmental policies. The profit driven focus we see in the rest of the world is often the reason why other countries are reluctant to change their constitution to something similar to Bhutan’s. 

So use Bhutan and its people as inspiration to campaign for your government's commitment to carbon neutrality and use sustainability as a key decision maker when voting in your next election. In your own life, acknowledge that small changes to your daily habits could influence others and have a big impact on your country’s carbon footprint. Bhutan has shown that the path to carbon neutrality is necessary for our future prosperity, however, climate change is a global phenomenon requiring a global effort.The first carbon negative country on Earth.."

*TL;DR The clothing industry is broken on almost every level, and broken in a way that ultimately fails the end user (as well as having significant negative externalities). All of this traces back to fundamental problem — a pervasive ethos of top down design — and I think an approach of user-driven development would create a better product (and a better industry). In light of this, I recommend buying clothes from clothing startups.*

**High Level Problems in Clothing Production**

While you may be someone who doesn’t care about what brand you’re wearing, or read Vogue, or follow the “trends,” the seasonal redefinition of high fashion houses still affects your user experience. This arbitrarily moving target affects what the stores you go to keep in stock, which has cascading effects throughout the industries’ approach to production and product development.

Here are the core problems with the top-down design ethos:

(1) Disincentivizes focus on making good products — there’s no reason to invest a year of R&amp;D on the best henley if it has a pre-defined shelf life of 1 season, and no reason to iterate on it if it will be out of style next year

(2) Incentivizes form over function or durability, creating the system that produced the fast fashion industry, which rewards cheap construction rather than valuable innovation on features

(3) Directly causes wasteful behaviors; i.e. no one is going to buy polka dots, or vests, or \[insert garment type here\] this season so a distributor might as well trash all that old inventory

**How These Problems Play Out**

I’ll try to keep the below description of how these effects play out brief so I can get to the point of how we could to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

[Img Source: https:\/\/miniaturerhino.myshopify.com\/blogs\/news\/repair-a-torn-seam-tutorial](https://preview.redd.it/g0evi18d7cj41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ae8564a09d5896d71fcf1e8b2db67b714f6642e)

**Fast Fashion is the Enemy of Quality**

Per the above, a very reasonable business approach to a market in which clothing designs can be more or less viewed as one-off (this product probably won’t last more than a season) is cheap production, low quality, and minimum investment in individual designs — going for a breadth of offerings rather than investing in the quality of a few specific products.

**Chaotic Production Sourcing Prevents Innovation**

Because it’s difficult for a factory to know that they’re still going to have orders for a specific item two years from now, the market for production is fragmented and volatile. This makes it difficult for small producers to have consistent relationships with factories. For the factory to survive it has to take the big order when it comes in from a large producer, even if that means reneging on commitments made to smaller producers.

It’s not the factory’s fault (they have to get the business when it shows up because the production opportunities are variable), it’s a systematic problem caused by the same top down design ethos that changes its mind about what end users ought to want every few months. Because of that design ethos, clothing companies are constantly solving and resolving the problem of sourcing production for the new items they’re creating that have differing requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond being hideously inefficient, that constant grind of finding new production sucks up the young hires from design schools into basically working on production teams. Much of the best new design talent in the fashion industry spends the majority of their time finding factories, sourcing, and chasing vendors to make everything quicker for cheaper rather than designing new clothes, which reinforces the entrenchment of the incumbent, ossified fashion elite (whose position in this system is causing all of these problems).

One of my roommates, Tammy, went to Parsons (the #1 design school) and used to be a designer at a major brand. She spent about 80% of her time doing production and sourcing, and in the remaining 20% for everything else (including, you know, designing) was still expected to produce 100+ designs a season (meaning she spent about 0.2% of her time that season on a given design). If we assume 9 hour workdays, that would mean over 3 months with 9 hour days she spent roughly 1 hour on each design.

**Horrifying Amounts of Waste**

This essay is focused on the systematic problems with product design in the clothing industry, but I would be remiss to leave out the environmental impact of all of this. 3 in 5 garments end up in a landfill or incinerator within a year. The fashion industry accounts for more carbon emissions than *aviation and shipping combined*. I could spend this whole post listing face-melting statistics about all of the waste produced by the fashion industry, but you can just google it yourself (it’s an interesting hole to go down).

**Moving Targets Prevent Iteration**

If you’re designing a product that’s going to be around for maybe a year, there is no reason to collect feedback on it and improve the design. You just make it (it’s cheap anyway), and if people buy it for a few months, great — and if they don’t you can just throw away the inventory.

Because your clothing isn’t maximizing for quality, you have enough room in your margins to make some winners and some losers then build up new lines on short notice for the next spring. “Might as well put the polka dot shorts design in the filing cabinet, next season is all corduroy capris. Looks like we need a factory that can provide that kind of stitching — see if that factory in Portugal can make room for us. How many yards of polka dot jersey cotton do we still have? Get rid of it we need that inventory space for corduroy…”

**No Incentive for Market Giants to Improve**

The inefficiency and volatility mentioned above reinforces the entrenchment of the existing giants in the market. Entrenched incumbents have very little incentive to innovate and every reason to maintain the status quo, which creates weird negative outcomes for, you know, *people who wear clothes*.

By way of example, many of the major men’s shirting brands use the same fit model for their shirts that they used in the early 90s (a very famous fit model who had a major hand in defining the fit model industry). If you’re running production at a major company, you don’t want to be the one that switches away from the guy everyone else uses (the gold standard) and takes the risk of rocking the boat.

But, say your target market is men in their mid-twenties: that fit model is not in his mid-twenties anymore. His arm, waist, chest etc. might still maintain their technical measurements — but I promise you the shirts don’t fit him the same as they would have thirty years ago. If you’re a guy in your mid-twenties, this might be why a lot of your collared shirts don’t fit right.

**What About Us? What About People Who Wear Clothes?**

And what does all of this do to serve the end user? If you’re interested in following the palace intrigue of fashion it can be interesting the same way some people find the hobby of following football interesting. Maybe that’s what the end user wants, or maybe the average end user of clothing is more like me: I don’t follow high fashion or football, and I just want my shirts to be better designed.

**Ok, So What Can We Actually Do About It?**

We have examples of industries where design has rapidly improved. The elephant in the room here is tech. One of the big differences in tech is an ethos of bottom up design.

* Create a basic MVP of the service you’re building and get it into the hands of users.
* Observe user behavior and incentivize user feedback.
* Capture that feedback.
* Iterate on the design.
* Repeat. Quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

The first product doesn’t have to be perfect. The important thing to focus on iterating effectively, which means creating a well oiled system for improving the product based on what the end user actually wants.

So I would recommend starting, seeking out, following, and and/or supporting brands that engage heavily with user feedback and prioritize iterative design. There is space now with the ease of getting exposure for e-commerce startups for new fashion companies to flip the clothing industry on its head and have user driven development create better products for end users. I would expect the landscape of the fashion industry to be much more decentralized, more specialized production-wise, and much *better at making clothes* within my lifetime.

I think these small companies will win, and in general will make better products. We're trying to do something in this vein ourselves (if you're interested you can check us out at [r/MeritStore](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeritStore/))Why Isn't Clothing Better Than It Was 30 Years Ago?"

As many of you will agree, climate change is a big problem that needs solving. To solve it however, we need people convinced it needs to be solved and then those people need to take action. To aid in this aspect, there have been many attempts to make a proper visualization of climate change to entice people to take action. Many of these have turned out to be ineffective. This is why we, from the University of Twente, located in the Netherlands, have started a research to find out what kind of visualization will help. This is a world-wide scale research. If you fill in this survey, which will only take you a couple of minutes, you can be part of the solution. Even if you don't agree with us, voice your opinion! It is valuable to us.   So please fill in the survey:

I'm also writing this as I sit here with a monstrous headache from some sickness I've caught and I'm just kind of trying to throw this out there quick while I'm thinking of it so I appologise in advance for any overly rambly bits. I'll throw a tl:dr at the end just in case its too much.

I'm trying to get some research done to more fully understand the issue, but I also want to know specifically what the scientific consensus has to say about some of the biggest claims by deniers. My dad for example isn't a full blown denier but enough of a self proclaimed uh, ""skeptic"" that he might as well be one. Here's some of the things I've heard him say before sounds ""fishy"" to him just for reference:

-The sun is going through a phase of more intensity which could therefore cause a rise in temperatures. I remember seeing a video debunk that one well but I can't remember what it was, but part of it had something to deal with the other planets not rising in average temperature

-The placement of some of the thermometers is ""suspicious"" according to him. For example he claimed one was placed somewhere that used to be an open grassland but now it's on a city street corner. Honestly I could be remembering wrong and he might have been talking about co2 but I seem to remember him saying something about black pavement getting hot under the sun raising temperatures so I think it was to deal with thermometers.

-Some rich billionaires stand to get more rich with certain carbon tax programs. Honestly just on the surface even if true this is probably the weakest point, just because some greedy people might take advantage of new innovations or policies doesn't mean there isn't a problem or we should let the current rich and greedy people in the fossil fuel industry do what they want. 

There was more I might add in an edit but that's just off the top of my head. Any well sourced video that addresses that and/or other common counterpoints by deniers or ""sceptics"", or other sources you can throw my way that address it would be greatly appreciated.

*TL;DR* -

Basically, if you could pick one video or documentary preferably inside of an hour, better yet shorter than thirty minutes, that would stand the best chance at tackling a denier or sceptics questions or the myths that are spread, that's well sourced, what would that be?What is the most persuasive, fact based video on man-made climate change preferably inside of an hour? + Thoughts on what I've heard my ""sceptic"" dad say?

0,"So  I'm not on of those who wears ""save the earth, it's the only home we  have"" tee  but I do refrain from using the one-time plastic products  when I think it's unnecessary. I do it because its seem like common  sense and I believe it does ""help"".

However,  I have a friend who doesn't believe in this action. Her reason is that  plastic is a by product of oil industry so as long as oil is still  extracted, plastic will still be produced. And so whether we use plastic  products or not, the plastic is still there and imposes harm to the  environment. She said that this sustainable movement is just another  trendy ""thing"" and people do it because it soothes their moral  conscience, but it's not fact-based.

Can someone confirm or (hopefully) dispute this? Fact checks and links are appreciated.Plastic is the by-product of oil industry so reducing use of plastic products is pointless?"
0,"I've been sitting on this idea for a couple years now, never really fleshing it out or digging too deep for fear of seeming dim. Ultimately I decided getting my idea out into the world would be a good thing, as getting some outside perspective and input almost always leads to improvement. Even if my idea is completely wrong and off-base, maybe someone smarter can take the premise of my idea and make it work. So, my idea is this:

A sort of Synthetic Tree. A device that can take in CO2, and split it into safe, breathable oxygen while eliminating the potential carbon emissions. 

I love science, and though I'm nowhere near the best or brightest, I want to use any idea I have to help people, and this seems like the only idea with some weight behind it. 

Capturing CO2 from thin air is [relatively simple ](https://physicsworld.com/a/how-to-efficiently-capture-carbon-dioxide-out-of-thin-air/) thanks to Klaus Lackner and his colleagues at Arizona State University who found a method that is 1000x more efficient at capturing CO2 from the atmosphere than trees.
[Here ](https://phys.org/news/2014-10-oxygen-molecules-carbon-dioxide.html), studies show that CO2 can be split apart using VUV rays (Vacuum Ultraviolet rays). This most commonly results in oxygen, and carbon monoxide, but it shows that it can be split, and in about 5% of cases produce straight up carbon. It seems like it'd be hard to harness this kind of thing and make it mass produceable, doesn't it? Well, [Japanese scientists](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140422113237.htm) have produced a solid-state lamp capable of emitting these high energy VUV rays, making it much easier to produce.

As for the carbon monoxide, this toxic gas can be destroyed using [CARULITE 300](http://www.caruscorporation.com/air/co-destruction) catalysts, effectively removing them from the situation. 

The heat created by the concentration of VUV rays could be converted with a thermoelectric generator into electricity which could be applied in whatever way it serves the greatest purpose.

Now in theory, the basic, very rough outline of my idea here is CO2 can be filtered out of the air, and split using the VUV rays. The resulting oxygen can be released back into the air and the carbon monoxide can be destroyed using a clean breathing catalyst, and the possibility of a thermoelectric generator being used adds several more possibilities. Obviously this isn't ready to be patented and manufactured, but I want to know how it can get closer. This seems, at least to me, like a relatively good way to go about emissions clean up, and this same idea can be translated to use on astronauts gear, space stations, etc. essentially removing the need to carry bulky oxygen tanks if they can simply filter out and reuse their own CO2 emissions. I welcome any and all comments, questions, concerns, and ideas. Ultimately I just want my idea out there, and maybe some how it'll make a difference.I'm not 100% sure if this is allowed, but can anyone help with my thought experiment on relieving carbon emissions?"

0,"For about a year now I have been sitting on a project that I feel would make a difference if it were made and it has been constantly tormenting me that I have lacked the motivation to push it forward in any meaningful way. After some introspection, I have concluded that the #1 reason why I haven't moved forward with the idea is that I have been too paranoid to actually give away any information on my idea. Well that ends today, here is my project.

( note before you read : this is a design concept, there is no prototype yet because I do not have a background in programming, I will explain that more at the end)

Envi is the codename for the social mapping concept that I came up for a graphic design class. To put it simply, it is a map where users can add ""pins"" for others in their community to see. Green pins are sustainable businesses, social services, environmental spots, etc. Blue pins can be pretty much any event in your community. Red pins are threats to the environment or threats to your community like MTBE groundwater contamination sites, factories dumping waste into rivers, or even things as small as trash on the side of the highway.

As these pins are created by users, it gives the event / problems in your community more attention. For example, there is a trailer park with contaminated groundwater from MTBE leaked in the 80's in a town near me. The cancer rates in the park are insanely high. One day I came across a man who lived there and was advocating about how he was going to bring it up to the state capitol … and then he mentioned how I also live near another leak site. If I never ran into that man, I would have never known about either of these contaminated sites. With Envi those MTBE sites would be big red marks for everyone in the surrounding areas to see, and all of those eyes will turn to the people trying to brush the issue under the rug to save a buck. Likewise, rallies and protests will also gain more exposure if the events are on the map ahead of time, leading to a greater turnout.

As an app, Envi will have two parts. The first part will be the map and the second part will be a social media platform much like any other, with one big difference. Unlike most big social media platforms, Envi will encourage users to participate in civil discussion with people they disagree with, rather than resorting to divisive behaviors like name calling and yelling matches. I know it is impossible to actually eliminate divisiveness and intolerance from a platform, but I believe there are plenty of people ready to move away from fb and other platforms that don't even really attempt to discourage division because it's profitable to them.

There are two goals of Envi, and I believe both will help the environment. The first goal is exposing the good and bad sustainability practices in a city through the social mapping system. The more people see, the more people will care. The second goal is to bring communities together through the advertisement and creation of events. I believe that a large reason why we are so divided and hateful today is because we live increasingly sheltered lives. The more we go out in our communities, the more we see the people who live around us, as well as the diverse opinions these people hold. As we see people who share differing opinions, and talk to them in a civilized manner, we realize that not all of our differences are bad. Heck you might even convince a climate change denier that the environment is in danger. I believe that as we overcome hatred and division, the health of the planet we live on becomes less of a partisan issue.

Now then, as I mentioned at the top of this post I have no programming knowledge to actually create the app. The biggest hurdle I was facing was overcoming my fear of publicizing my ideas literally anywhere. Now that hurdle is being jumped, the next big hurdle to overcome will be creating a team with a programmer and forming a community to help support the project. In the end I do not want this project to be ""my"" project, much like the pins I want Envi itself to be community driven. That being said, I have created a subreddit and discord for anybody to join and give their ideas on how to make the application as appealing and successful as possible so it makes a good impact.

0,"We’ve heard about the effects a high-sugar, high-fat diet can have on our health, yet we shouldn’t overlook the impact of our dietary choices on the environment.

From growing crops to packaging and transporting goods, up to a third of all greenhouse gas emissions come from the agriculture sector. As Australia (and Victoria) become more environmentally conscious, veganism has surged, with a portion of our population adhering to a strict plant-based diet.

However, to make sustainable and consistent dietary changes, they must be achievable in small, everyday changes that anyone can adopt into their eating habits.

0,"An amazing aspect to social justice is the respect of all cultures and faiths, making all feel welcomed as people. And, regardless of cultural differences, we as people should stand for the environment. 

When one works with a clay, or almost any craft on that matter, there is left a print of the creator on their creation. So, if there’s a Creator, I believe that the creation would have an aspect of the Creator. This, as I’m aware, is strongly both an Islamic and Catholic philosophy. 

Romans 1:20 teaches that God in his holiness leaves his evidence in what he has made. And in Genesis 1:31 it is stated that when the creator viewed the creation, it was indeed very good. 
So consider, if creation is very good, how very evil it must then be to misuse it. And that is also a Judaic concept on environmentalism. 

So with this concept in mind, it is a vice or sin against God to harm the environment. As his goodness is within creation, to protect it is to honour and serve the Creator God. And that is a strong indigenous philosophy on the Creator.
I’m not here to convert anyone and for that reason I wasn’t clear on what exact perspective I’m coming from. But all faiths offer a truth for humanity; therefore, we should learn about all cultures to respect each other as a people. So maybe this isn’t for you but there’s someone who may need to be enlighten on this manner.My cultural take on environmentalism"

0,"I completely believe in human caused global warming which is creating climate change. Since humans have industrialized, we have burned up the vast majority of fossil fuels - which took hundreds of millions of years for the earth to create - in just 150 years. The science is valid. We now have a very high rate of CO2 in our atmosphere (410 ppm vs 170-280 ppm which is believed to be the historical average), and we may already be causing extreme weather patterns.

However, we are ignoring another huge topic of scientific fact. Where I am sitting right now near NYC was under thousands of feet of ice ""only"" (geologically speaking) 20,000 years ago. Long Island was formed by the debris pushed by giant glaciers in that same period. So, things change pretty drastically with or without man made carbon dioxide. 

Many scientists believe that we should be entering into a new natural cooling trend that would result in the next glaciation period. This is a cyclical occurrence that has been happening for billions of years. (for more information Google Milankovitch cycles.)

Humans would not do well in another ice age period like we had 20,000 years ago. It would almost certainly cause the demise of the majority of people on earth and the culture of that time.

Some scientists believe that the current global warming trend may be pushing back the next ice age by 100,000 years. Is that not a possibility? 

Granted, ice ages are natural events that shape the earth in beautiful ways (Long Island?). Affecting that cycle would alter the natural balance, and many would say that is an awful thing. However, an ice age would also destroy much of humanity.

The Climate Change debate is very polarized. Advocates believe an apocalypse is imminent. Recently, I have seen maps implying that my county would be under water - even though 99% of it is way above sea level. The more the deniers deny, the more hysterical the advocates get. Democratic Politicians are betting their candidacy on huge programs to address climate change.

My view is that we should definitely transition away from fossil fuels and invest in renewal energy. My rationale is more around the fact that fossil fuels will eventually run out plus the fact that so much war and suffering results over the struggle to control the fossil fuel reserves and production.

However, it seems like most people are not radicalized by Global Warming / Climate Change and are just not willing to make any sacrifices because of the potential threat. Maybe the overall science is really on their side. We will find out anyway, as it seems like a cascade effect has now started and there will be significant warming and high sea levels to deal with. Hopefully, in time, the Milankovitch cycle will offset the effect and all that extra CO2 might help us to avoid an ice age apocalypse.Global warming may save mankind"

New religions are emerging in the context of climate change. Religions have an agenda that is appropriate for their time and combines this with spirituality. In reality, the only way to find spirituality is independent thinking. By reading you can acquire knowledge, but by internalizing wisdom.  
Interestingly, global warming and carbon dioxide emissions are talked about, when the focus should be on soil and water protection, and heavy particle emissions from factories. But don't worry about saving the world. Buy electric car,  It does not need to be produced in any factory, and it does not dig and process the battery materials with an insane amount of water. Electricity is as much as 32-38% renewable here in Finland.  
In the 1970s, however, fusion power funding got terminated in America by a one-man decision, because it did not receive plutonium as a by-product to use in nuclear weapons. Even low-isotope materials are better utilized in the reactor and there is no significant production of hazardous nuclear waste. The fusion power principle mimics the sun, the byproduct are hydrogen and an insane amount of heat. Hydrogen can be refueled in a car and utilized through a fuel cell in an electric motor (Toyota Mirai). They also once considered hydrogen generation to be a problem during the reaction. Hydrogen can also be made by electricity in modern times, even from seawater, without corrosion of the metal pairs.  
Promoting good solutions helps more than continuous (climate) tax increases. For example Finland also finances climate projects with big money, which is really just washing the image. Billions can be thrown at a bad idea without it being realized, when a good idea is realized with less.  
Also sunspots and our pole shift probably affects more on how warm it is, more than carbon dioxide that the plants love. Best way to combat this naturally would be to grow hemp instead of trees for paper, clothes, medicine, composites, oil etc.  It absorbs four times more carbon dioxide than trees and grows faster.  
Not much solutions talk about this, they just love to spend money to something. Its like when the baddest Mafioso goes to church to donate and washes his sins by that. You can spend zillions to combat this, but it won't help if the project is dud itself.  Super rich love to protect their investments and recourses, even when they are nearing the end of usability.

Tyrannies are always prepared with noble causes, and by controlling energy  you control the world.

Your toughts about this? Or is it just better to skip the school spread panic about the ""problem"" and make it a religion. False prophets are many.

([https://www.coolframes.ca/glasses/tapout-martial-arts-eyewear/tap811-mens-rx-reading-eyeglasses.html](https://www.coolframes.ca/glasses/tapout-martial-arts-eyewear/tap811-mens-rx-reading-eyeglasses.html)) From my research I have made a life cycle about glass frames as I could not get much information about my lenses. If any of this information is wrong or there is a better way to explain it please inform me. (Life Cycle Picture:[https://imgur.com/a/sVnzH47](https://imgur.com/a/sVnzH47))

The first part is designing the frames. This is where they plan out how the frames will look and the size of them. This doesn’t do too much to impact our planet. 

The second part is manufacturing the frames. This has a pretty big impact as to make them into the shape they have a factory line releasing a lot of fossil fuels while molding/shaping the frames. This is impactful to the Atmosphere as it releases fossil fuels into the air. 

The Third part is Shipping the frames. This is really bad for the environment as the distance from my frame's factory is about 5000km away from the retailer. This can release a lot of fossil fuels especially if they use road vehicles for transportation as that distances would release about 4000kg of carbon into the atmosphere each way. 

The fourth and fifth part is self-explanatory about buying and fitting/wearing the glasses. This doesn’t do anything to the world. 

The sixth part splits into two paths. Being recycled and being thrown out. The worse path being thrown out can impact our world because plastic takes a very long to decompose making it sit in a place for a lot of years. This can impact the Biosphere as animals could think it was food and try eating it. It can impact the hydrosphere as there are a few giant piles of trash in the ocean and that is bad for the ocean and ocean life. Being recycled is better as it reuses the plastic, so it doesn’t go into dumps or the ocean. After being recycled the frames are sent back to the retailer and resold from part 4.  

This is what I have researched and if there is anything I can do better in this, please tell me in the comments.

I always find it depressing when people are all up in arms following a disaster and simply do nothing about it. They go on living their lives the same and all the while are contributing to the problem that they purported to want to try and solve just a few months ago.

I think it is really important that we change the way the media and the public talk about these things. The media presents a natural disaster as an issue as ""an issue"" and climate change as ""a cause"" and then when the issue dies down we forget about the cause. I also think humans are built as to neglect long term invisible dangers and focus on short term visible ones. How can environmentalists take advantage of these terrible disasters to try and convince others to make real change in stopping them from occurring in the future?

Here are a few articles/essays I found provocative and I was wondering what other psychology or philosophy has been done on the subject.

""Even  at scenarios of low warming, each region of the world will face severe  risks to national and global security in the next three decades,"" the  report states. ""Higher levels of warming will pose catastrophic, and  likely irreversible, global security risks over the course of the 21st  century.""

The [report](https://climateandsecurity.org/a-security-threat-assessment-of-global-climate-change/),  titled “A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change: How  Likely Warming Scenarios Indicate a Catastrophic Security Future"" was  released Monday by the [Center for Climate and Security](https://climateandsecurity.org/), a non-partisan security policy institute.

To avoid such dire future impacts, the report recommends ""quickly reducing and phasing out greenhouse gas emissions.""

Human-caused  climate change, aka global warming, is caused by the burning of fossil  fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release heat-trapping greenhouse  gases like carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. This has caused  the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural  factors. 

So far, the globe has warmed about 2  degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration said.  

The report identifies major threats, including  heightened social and political instability and risks to U.S. military  missions and infrastructure, as well as security institutions across all  regions of the world.

In North America, under a  low-warming scenario (1.8 to 3.6 degrees by 2050), the region ""will  experience more intense, extreme events like storms and wildfires, with  significant impacts on life, property, security infrastructure and  democratic institutions,"" the report said. 

""The  assessment is clear – climate change is a pressing risk to national and  global security, and will evolve to become a severe and systemic threat  the more we allow global temperatures to rise,"" said report co-author  Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense. 

""Our  panel's analysis shows that no region of the world will be left  unaffected, and climate impacts will interact in dangerous ways in even  near-term, lower levels of warming,"" Goodman said. 

The  report added that ""climate change will present significant threats to  U.S. military missions across all of its geographic areas of  responsibility as well as to regional security institutions and  infrastructure that are critical for maintaining global security.""

In  addition to phasing out fossil fuels, the report said ""the world must  also 'climate-proof' environments, infrastructure, institutions and  systems on which human security depends."" And in the U.S., ""we call for  renewed efforts to prioritize, communicate and respond to climate  security threats.""

Report co-author Rod Schoonover of the Center for Climate and Security said, ""it’s the job of the U.S. intelligence  community to anticipate risks to national security, and provide  strategic warning to appropriate policymakers.

""The  science has long been clear, and the security community is adding  compelling analysis of the threats climate change pose to people and  nations. It’s long past time for vigorous action to address them,"" he  said. Climate change could be a 'catastrophic' national security threat, report warns"

You can clearly see [here](https://serc.carleton.edu/integrate/teaching_materials/water_science_society/student_materials/720) that the river's flow has been stable since the 1930s. 

I know you're going to point to the high levels of water flow in the 20s, but that was an anomaly.

This chart from the same source shows that over the last 1200 years, the river's flow has been hovering around 15 million acre feet. 

The fact of that matter is we don't know what the regional impacts of climate change will be. We do know that warmer air holds more moisture and so precipitation, on average, will go *up*. Maybe the Colorado river will dry up, but there's a greater chance that the torrential rainfall of 1983 will become permanent.

0,"Hi r/environment, I imagine you're bored of the question ""which alternative milk is the most environmentally friendly?"", and while it seems that consensus has been reached, with most people (myself included) settling on oat milk, I feel the decision has become complicated by a question I've been asking myself recently. The brand of oat milk I drink is not manufactured in the country that I live in, it is shipped from overseas. How does the impact of international shipping (though I imagine it is in incredible bulk) compare to the emissions associated with the production of other milk alternatives? For example, could drinking a milk alternative other than oat which is produced in my country actually reduce my carbon footprint by removing freight shipping from the equation? Or could collecting dairy milk locally by emissionless means even be superior overall to any of the alternative milk products which require some amount of transport? 


Thank you for considering my quite long winded question, and apologies if there is a straightforward answer - objective reporting on these sorts of things appears to be difficult to find.A milk alternative complication"
0,"Further illustrating the international stakes and genocidal consequences of the University of California (UC) cover-up is the role the university has played in Japan, where approximately 18 percent of the radioactive fallout landed.

Once again, the UC failed to warn the Japanese people of how serious the dangers posed by Fukushima’s fallout were, even as its secret model [indicated the need](https://publicism.info/environment/fukushima/6.html) to evacuate Tokyo, the largest metropolitan area in the world.

This recommendation was subsequently given by others such as [Dr. Shigeru Mita](https://web.archive.org/web/20140721231203/http:/www.save-children-from-radiation.org:80/2014/07/16/a-tokyo-doctor-who-has-moved-to-western-japan-urges-fellow-doctors-to-promote-radiation-protection-a-message-from-dr-mita-to-his-colleagues-in-kodaira-city-t/), a physician who relocated his practice from Tokyo after observing symptoms of radiation sickness since 2011, and advises that inhabitants should leave the city due to the health consequences of the radiation there.

Dr. Mita’s warning is buttressed by the epidemiological evidence, which indicates that the health consequences of Fukushima radiation are already taking a serious toll in Japan – and not just in Fukushima prefecture – including:

* Thyroid cancer incidence more than doubling in Fukushima and several neighboring prefectures

* A range of heart diseases increasing throughout Japan, with a 50 percent overall increase of heart attacks and 80 percent increase in Tokyo

* Leukemia incidence more than doubling in Fukushima and several neighboring prefectures, with a 42 percent overall increase for Japan.

Backing up this epidemiological evidence is extensive radiation measurement, including [one study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319090071_The_Human_Consequences_of_the_Fukushima_Dai-ichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant_Accidents) which found that every one of its soil samples taken from a variety of places in Tokyo were so toxic that they would all be legally treated as radioactive waste by the U.S. government.

We are doing the traditional thing where the groom's family plans the rehearsal dinner.  It won't be small for a rehearsal dinner - between 45 and 60.  I want to do everything I can to respect her love of this plant and her desire to keep it clean while planning everything.  

Does anyone have any idea that I can do that will make the dinner as green as possible?  I found some plant-based plates and silverware online.  Is that better than paper plates?  Are both compostable?  I know better than to do plastic silverware but I'm not sure what to do about the plates. 

I am really excited about this wedding and love her and her passion for this.  Any ideas that can help me show her that she is part of this family now and we embrace her and everything that is important to her would really be appreciated.Need help making a party green"

The right to a healthy environment is enshrined in its constitution and 99% of the country’s energy already comes from renewable sources.  In fact, Costa Rica aims to be 100% carbon neutral by 2021, decades sooner than most other countries.  In this video, President Carlos Alvarado Quesada explains how investment in Costa Rica’s citizens has been the best way to ensure economic growth. Having abolished its military in 1948, the country has more money to spend on universal, free healthcare and education. What could your country learn from Costa Rica?

*We know you guys have a no fundraiser rule, which is definitely reasonable. We see this more as a fun challenge to show climate awareness, and we hope you agree!*

Hey! I’m part of a team of ten MIT students and we recently launched a challenge to save trees from deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. I know this isn’t the most normal post for this subreddit, but we thought you guys (as environment lovers 🌳) might be excited to do our challenge and spread the word!

*We’re trying to spread awareness of climate change through the #SaveTheTreesChallenge. We’re partnering with the Rainforest Trust to raise $100k and save 50 million trees—there have been a lot of efforts lately to plant new trees (which have certainly inspired us!), but mature trees remove carbon from the air at a much higher rate than newly planted saplings, making it extremely crucial to preserve them.*

Here’s our challenge:

*1) Ask a friend to snap a picture of you hugging a tree like a Koala bear. Don’t be afraid to get creative!*

*2) Post the picture on your IG/FB with our* [*sample caption*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ywB29jCvbIC9REYk2Rb59fbeABTz8HXZxVunEDyLRU4/edit) *and challenge 3 of your friends!*

*3) Donate $10 at* [*savethetreeschallenge.com/donate*](https://savethetreeschallenge.com/donate) *to save 5,000 trees from deforestation!*

I found this new song [Glaciers feat. Obama](https://soundcloud.com/user-446249811/glaciers-feat-obama) by the artist Corporate Dough on SoundCloud. It’s a powerful hip-hop track about the urgency of climate change action. It’s really well done and uses some audio from one of Obama’s speeches when he talks about glaciers and climate change.


I think it’s exactly the kind of song that could go viral and bring awareness of environmental issues to a broader audience. We need more environmentally conscious hip-hop. This is the kind of messaging that works for younger generations.

In the world of today, we know the negative impacts of the meat industry on animal welfare and environmental protection. However, only a small minority of humans choose for plant-based diets, while meat consumption is often mentioned as one of the most impactful changes in behavior consumers can make.

As people are getting more aware of their conventional meat diet, many individuals yet are unwilling or unable to change their habits. Do you believe that a time will come in which the majority of humans are willing to rethink their current habits, by sacrificing their own meat consumption needs in order to move towards a more sustainable, conscious and animal-friendly society?

In March 2014, investor and activist Lauren McCollum, who previously attempted to become a member of the Santa Monica Municipal Airport Commission, Flora Yin, a lawyer for the law firm Reed &amp; Davidson LLP, and actor Nikos Kokotakis filed a petition to keep the airport operating. The appeal garnered 15,000 signatures. 

According to an investigation by the Community Against Santa Monica Airport Traffic (CASMAT), the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) invested $36,000 through Reed &amp; Davidson LLP to lobby for the initiative and encouraged signature collectors to pay $2 per signature and later $4 as the deadline approached. AOPA also posted news about the initiative on its website. In 2015, Reed &amp; Davidson indicated AOPA as its client, as well as LGBT Center, which had received donations from Lauren McCollum and her romantic partner Tatiana Sylvana Dora Botton.

0,"Americans have the highest HDI - Human Development Index and with a high HDI the per capita Ecological foot print also increases. I think permissible threshold for a per capita is 2.1 and anything beyond that is considered unsustainable to the environment. I think for American it is something around 9? Though Cuba is the only exception which seems to have have HDI of a developed country still below threshold of the unsustainable ecological foot print.

What do you guys think this is the case? I mean consumerism and capitalism exists across the whole world but there is something very specifically unique about countries like these? What do you guys think is leading to such a an outcome in the ecological foot print both at a Macro level - Industries, Politics, Military, Law &amp; Enforcement, Education and essentially at Micro Level - Personal individual lifestyle choices, impulsive and neurotic gratification seek behavior, consumption of bland forms of media and art-forms, supermarket culture?  


I am very much interested in having a deep perspective on the individual lifestyle choices of the people residing from these developing countries. How different is their pattern of consumption from a person consumption behavior of a person from developing countries. Let us take India for example, even this country has a great influence of capitalism and consumers which heavily rely on fast fashion and processed foods?

0,"Translation in English

We, the undersigned, represent different disciplines and academic fields. The views we express here bind us and do not bind the institutions we work for. Whatever our areas of expertise, we all make the same observation: for decades, successive governments have been unable to implement strong and rapid actions to deal with the climate and environmental crisis whose urgency is growing all days. This inertia can no longer be tolerated. 

  
Scientific observations are indisputable and disasters are happening before our eyes. We are in the midst of the 6th mass extinction, dozens of species are disappearing every day, and pollution levels are alarming in every way (plastics, pesticides, nitrates, heavy metals, etc.). 

  
To speak only of the climate, we have already exceeded the additional temperature of 1 ° C compared to the pre-industrial era, and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has never been so high for several million years. According to the 2019 emissions monitoring report of the United Nations Environment and Development Program (UNEP), the commitments made by the countries under the Paris Agreement of 2015 put us on a trajectory of at least + 3 ° C by 2100, assuming they are respected. The objective of limiting global warming below + 1.5 ° C is now out of reach unless global emissions are reduced by 7.6% per year, while they increased by 1.5% per year in over the past ten years. Each additional degree increases the risk of going beyond tipping points, causing a cascade of irreversible consequences (collapse of the ice floe, thawing of permafrost, slowing of ocean currents, etc.). Preparatory studies for the next IPCC report (CNRS-CEA-Météo France) suggest that previous reports have underestimated the extent of the changes already underway. Global warming of more than 5 ° C can no longer be ruled out if the current runaway of greenhouse gas emissions continues. At these temperature levels, the habitability of France would be called into question by temperature and humidity levels causing death from hyperthermia.  

  
Human societies cannot continue to ignore the consequences of their activities on the planet without suffering the consequences, as many studies have shown every day and more clearly every day reflecting scientific consensus. If we persist on this path, the future of our species is bleak.

    
Our government is complicit in this situation by neglecting the precautionary principle and by not recognizing that infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is quite simply a dead end. The objectives of economic growth which it defends are in total contradiction with the radical change of economic and productive model which it is essential to engage without delay. Current French climate and biodiversity protection policies fall far short of the challenges and urgency we face. Far from confirming an alleged opposition between ecology and social justice, the movement of yellow vests rightly denounced the inconsistency and hypocrisy of politicians who would like to impose sobriety on the one hand while promoting on the other a unbridled consumerism and an unequal and predatory economic liberalism. Continuing to promote superfluous and energy-consuming technologies like 5G or the autonomous car is irresponsible at a time when our lifestyles must evolve towards more frugality and when our collective efforts must be concentrated on the ecological and social transition.  

  
The lack of results from this policy is obvious: as noted by the High Council for the Climate, the budget for greenhouse effect gas emissions set by the French National Low Carbon Strategy was not respected between 2015 and 2018. Despite declarations of good intentions, France's carbon footprint per capita (including imported emissions) remains today still above its 1995 level, at 11 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita and per year , whereas it must drop to 2 tonnes by 2050.  


The next decade will be decisive in limiting the extent of future deregulation. We refuse to allow the youth of today and future generations to pay the consequences of the unprecedented catastrophe that we are preparing and whose effects are already being felt. When a government knowingly renounces its responsibility to protect its citizens, it has failed in its essential role.  

  
Consequently, we call to take part in the actions of civil disobedience carried out by the ecological movements, whether they are historic (Friends of the Earth, Attac, Confédération paysanne, Greenpeace…) or formed more recently (Non-violent action COP21, Extinction Rebellion , Youth for Climate…). We invite all citizens, including our scientific colleagues, to mobilize to demand action from our political leaders and to change the system from below today. By acting individually, by coming together on a professional or local citizen level (for example in neighborhood committees), or by joining existing associations or movements (Alternatiba, Cities in transition, Territorial alternatives, etc.), room for maneuver will be created to make skip the locks and develop alternatives.  


We also ask the authorities to tell the truth about the gravity and the urgency of the situation: our current way of life and economic growth are not compatible with limiting climate change to acceptable levels. We call on national and local politicians alike to take immediate action to genuinely reduce France’s carbon footprint and halt the loss of biodiversity. We also urge the executive and Parliament to put environmental issues before private interests by ambitiously applying the proposals stemming from the Citizen Climate Convention and by extending its mandate to give it the power to monitor their implementation. artwork.

Any information you have on this, even if it just approximations, would be great. I have a few bits on a couple of the more common ones but nothing substantial.

Then I need to find a wholesaler in Colombia who might potentially sell them. I need hypothetical prices on buying seeds/saplings in bulk. And finally, what kind of spacing between trees would you suggest?

Thanks in advanceTropical Tree Questions"

So I doubt many people on this subreddit would ever claim that climate change isn't happening. Maybe some variation on the degree on which it's happening, but it's happening. So why don't we force public schools to teach about global warming? After all more informed students should be able to make better choices right? 

Personally I'd say... No, this topic probably doesn't need to be specifically taught in schools. Sure, it probably wouldn't be bad to bring it up during certain specific discussions where it's relevant like maybe how the industrial revolution involved a lot of carbon dioxide generation, but for the most part the topic itself shouldn't necessarily be required to be specifically taught. 

My main idea of this comes under the idea that ""Schools exist to teach you how to think."" The more time we focus on one specific subject the less time we have on things like general science, and wouldn't that be a funny scenario 

""Ok kids, here is how the world is doomed. Now use all that Chemistry knowledge to he-"" 

""Ms. Teacher this was supposed to be our chemistry class..."" 

Hyperbole aside as long as you teach students basic facts about science/chemistry it should be easy to put the dots together on what is going on with climate change with so many organizations putting out information. Plus if you really want to tackle climate change it's more important to teach the adults green habits that they can pass on to their kids, along with improving actual education. Ramping up the stem fields to get more scientists and engineers and some of the extra will probably help with efficiency and new cleaner technologies. Plus maybe a little more focus on economics so students better understand the structure that emphasizes cheap energy over clean energy and how maybe that system can be shifted. Any other thoughts?Climate Change Education Act, does this specific topic need to be taught in schools?"

0,"Hello Senator Rubio,
                   As a citizen of the USA and Florida, I am deeply concerned about the future of our oceans, trees, and majestic wildlife that inhabits our beautiful state of Florida. My name is ———————, a——--year-old boy who admires wildlife, God, and my right to education. Right now, we face the problem of plastic. 
      In 2016 alone, 335 million megatons of plastic were produced (Science Advances). The part that is scary is that only 9% of that plastic was recycled, and a similar number was disintegrated (12%). That means 79% of plastic is sent to landfills to rot, erode into micro plastic, and be consumed by birds(United Nation Environment). In fact, 90% of sea birds have eaten plastic and by 2050, this number will increase up to 99% (Jaymi Heimbuch).
     Plastic bottles are a big contributor to this problem. There are also health cons to plastic bottles. Two of these are BPA and phthalates. BPA is used as an inner coating in plastics and metal cans to stop corrosion and breaking (Healthline). As great as it sounds, according to Mayo Clinic, “Exposure to BPA is a concern because of possible health effects of BPA on the brain and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. It can also affect children's behavior. Additional research suggests a possible link between BPA and increased blood pressure.” This assessment is based on 100s of studies (Mayo Clinic). It is even found in 93% of people above age 6’s urine (CDC). But the FDA still considers it safe, and is monitoring it. 
      Phthalates are used to make plastic bendy and squeezable. They are found in wallpaper, car seats, and beauty products (Healthcare Without Harm). These can cause problems in the kidneys, liver, lungs, and reproductive system (Healthcare Without Harm). Both are used all the time and can pose threats to our health. This is honestly pretty terrifying to me, and I would think it would be to you too. Plastic is a huge factor in everything we do, from covering our foods to being in the water we drink. Yet when studies come up that it might be dangerous, we say nothing about it. There has been little media coverage as well.
      Microplastics come from plastic that has been eroded by UV rays. There are between 15-51 trillion microplastics particles in our oceans today (GreenBiz). These plastics are consumed by small sea creatures such as plankton, and makes it's way to our dinner plates through the food chain. According to the journal Environmental Science and Technology, humans consume anywhere from 39,000 to 52,000 Microplastic particles every single year. This crisis has become so exponential and large, I believe it must be addressed.
      Personally, I believe the way to improve this is not by banning plastic, that is absurd and quite frankly, impossible. I believe we can invest in alternatives such as seaweed. Seaweed is very abundant; it can grow up to three meters a day (Wired UK). Plus, Wired UK states, and I quote, “just 0.03 per cent of the brown seaweed in the world could replace all of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles we get through every year.” 
     Other alternatives such as bamboo straws, and a system where you pay extra tax on plastic, but if you return this plastic you will receive the money back with slight increase. With your help, a person in power, who represents me, as someone who I admire, I ask for your help to unite with me and my fellow citizens of our magnificent Earth to end this problem. I thank you very much for your time and understanding.
God bless!

0,"I apologize that this post is so long, but here is an explanation of why I think Bernie is the best candidate for addressing climate change and why this election really matters for the global environment. I’ve honestly been pretty politically apathetic my entire life, but the more I’ve learned about climate change and how urgent it is, the more I’ve become convinced that politics really matters. The only way we can stop climate change is with huge, worldwide societal changes – and the only way to organize mass change like that is through government policy. No matter which presidential candidate wins the upcoming election, I think that it will take massive protests / marches / demonstrations to pressure our politicians into addressing the climate crisis, but I think Bernie would be the best president to help lead us in the right direction. In addition, he has the most proven track record of any democratic presidential candidate and truly understands the complexities of the issues – I think moreso than any of the other candidates.

But first, here are two webpages that show the urgency of the climate crisis. (I haven’t cited any of my sources, but can do so if enough people would like to see them - although they are pretty easy to find by googling)

**NASA’s website shows graphs of atmospheric CO2:** (The second graph shows that CO2 levels have been below 300 ppm for the last 8 million years and we are now at 412 ppm. Scientists have said 400 ppm is the “tipping point” of climate disaster and that we now need to extract CO2 from the atmosphere to avoid catastrophe.)

[https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)

**Article from Yale’s website that talks about why 400 ppm of CO2 is so important.** 

[https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters)

&amp;#x200B;

Average global atmospheric temperatures have already risen by 1.2°C and scientists have stated that we have to limit temperature change to 2°C or we’re really screwed. The last time that the atmospheric CO2 concentration was &gt;400 ppm, sea levels were 15-25 meters higher than they are now and weather patterns had extreme droughts and storm events. Apparently, unless we stop the growth of fossil fuels in the next 10 years, global temperatures will increase &gt; 2°C and the environment will become significantly more unlivable.

Even if we were to ignore rising CO2 levels, there is a whole laundry list of additional problems that we will face over the next hundred years that have the potential for leading to catastrophe. I’m including this list to show that we need to start thinking of our current situation as a crisis. If we don’t start taking serious action soon, our earth may become unlivable by the time our children pass into the 22nd century. Each of these issues might not individually result in making earth unlivable, but it might turn out that these issues are interrelated and may result in a sort of chain-reaction where these issues are intensified by the eachother. 

**List of Additional Issues**

* Increase of natural disasters, storms and droughts due to climate change
* Climate refugees (scientists have difficulty accurately projecting numbers of refugees, but some have estimated up to 1 billion climate refugees by 2050)
* Worldwide water shortages
* Desertification of environment
* Plastic Pollution (great pacific garbage patch is only estimated to represent 1% of plastic in pacific ocean – most plastic sinks or exists as microplastics that cannot be collected)
* Decline of Bee populations (rate of decline varies by species, but certain species populations have declined as much as 91%. Certain areas in China have devastated insect populations so greatly that human workers are hired to manually pollinate crops using small brushes)
* Habitat degradation all over the word (deforestion of rainforests worldwide, death of coral reefs from ocean temperature rise and ocean acidification, river habitat pollution and degradation)
* Loss of biodiversity worldwide and unknown environmental problems
* Ozone depletion (many scientists believe that the ozone layer is still in decline, although it is hard to prove)
* Urbanization and urban sprawl and resulting environmental consequences
* “Peak” nonrenewable resources (worldwide copper and phosphorous reserves \[just to name a couple\] are two resources that are expected to start running out in the next 30-40 years. Copper is the most widely used conductive material used for wire and phosphorous is used to fertilize virtually all crops on earth.)
* Deforestation
* Leaching coal ash landfills (Estimated that 90% of coal ash landfills leach into nearby groundwater – releasing toxic arsenic, mercury, etc. into nearby environment)
* Rising sea levels
* Extreme overpopulation (global population expected to reach 9 billion in the next 20 years)
* Food scarcity (new food systems are needed – cows alone result in huge amounts of CO2 pollution. Also, increased droughts will result in significant reductions in crop yields)
* Nuclear weapon proliferation (as climate change issues create more problems and climate refugees but strain on countries worldwide, global political tension will increase and the possibility of nuclear war will increase)
* Threat of plagues spreading in our increasingly interconnected world.

While I would typically be happy with a moderate democrat president because they are less divisive for American politics, I seriously don’t believe that a moderate candidate will make the necessary environmentally-focused, societal changes that are needed in the next ten years. For example Buttigieg/Biden/Klobuchar (moderate candidates) have said that they will stop the expansion of fracking in the US, but Sanders/Warren (progressive candidates) have said they want to ban fracking immediately which is the type of change we need. 

Elizabeth Warren is the only other democratic candidate that has a plan even close to Bernie’s to address the climate crisis (think Green New Deal), but her plan isn’t nearly as detailed as Bernie’s and proposes only spending 1/5th of the money that Bernie proposes (it’s going to be very expensive to convert all of America to using clean energy systems). She was also a republican up until 1996 and doesn’t have the history of caring about the environment and other issues the way Bernie has for like 40 years. If you look at his track record, he has basically been the driving force behind almost all of the Democratic party’s most important issues, including Medicare-for-All, free college tuition, and the climate crisis. Also, Warren’s political experience is with writing public policy and working on fiscal-related issues, while Bernie has more leadership-based experience. Over his career, his campaigns have carried serious momentum and had the ability to excite people in a way that other politicians struggle to do. He doesn’t accept any money from billionaires or big business while Warren does (which means that she is more likely to be influenced by those business’ interests). 

If interested, listen to Bernie Sanders speak on a podcast or TV interview (I’ll recommend his podcast interview with Joe Rogan). He is extremely smart and truly understands all of the issues. I also love that he is kinda goofy looking and doesn’t have the same politiciany-feel that so many other candidates have, he’s very sincere and authentic. 

He also really cares about the average American and has for the last like 40 years. Other candidates can say that they care, but they can’t back it up like he can. He wants a 15 dollar minimum wage (other candidates have adopted that stance but he literally came up with it) and he wants to take away power from huge companies that leave lower class Americans (the majority of the population) struggling. So anyways, that’s why I think Bernie is the best candidate.Why Bernie Sanders is Best Democratic Candidate for the Environment (And in General)"

0,"Fairfax County, Virginia has a health problem encountered by many places in the US and other countries, Air Pollution. 
  There are different types of air pollution. One type is Ozone pollution. To get to the basics we must remember what Ozone is. It is made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is at both the ground level and in the atmosphere. In the atmosphere it helps protect us from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. It is a pollutant if it comes from the ground. The ground level ozone is not released directly into the air but by chemical reactions. They can come out when cars or different industrial power plants react to the sunlight emitting this ozone. The days with the most of this ground level ozone are hot days. The people who are at risk from breathing this ozone are young and old people, people with asthma and outdoor workers. A lot of health problems from this are breathing issues, throat pains, and reduced lung function. Ozone also affects vegetation and ecosystems. 
     Another major pollution that is bad in the air is particle pollution. The “particles” are a mixture of liquid and solid droplets in the air. They do come in many shapes and sizes and contain acids, inorganic compounds, organic chemicals, soot, metals, soil and biological materials. Particles are always in the air we breathe in. Particles that are small and can hardly be seen by the eye are more of a danger than big visible particles because they can enter the lungs without you knowing it. The people who are already having multiple health risks are the most vulnerable. Particles of concern are grouped into two main categories, coarse particles and fine particles. The difference between these two different kinds of particles is where they come from, what they are made up of and what they can do to you. Particles are emitted energy, construction and fire directly or form from atmospheric reactions involving chemicals. High levels of these particles are found in urban areas, wood burning and hot areas. 
Using your car less often is a great way to reduce air pollution. Riding a bike or walking to nearby places is a better alternative to using a car. Spreading awareness about air pollution, however, is the best way to prevent it.Air pollution in Virginia"

https://preview.redd.it/why3xn5hbzg41.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5585b8024de0bfba70aa3d7d527d734cfce35db8

Most places have [gotten wetter over the last century.](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/delgenio_02/) The one major exception is the Sahel, and that drying was caused by Aerosol pollution from Europe and North America, and since those emissions have all but vanished, [rainfall has made a strong recovery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425713003325) and one study predicts that 2 degrees of warming over preindustrial levels would turn that part of the world into a [lush grassland](https://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/8/495/2017/).

And specific claims about drought at the regional level aren't borne out. If you only read the news media, you wouldn't know that the Colorado River provides [just as much water now as it did in the 30s](https://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/graphics/colorado-river-basin-supply-vs-use) or that rainfall in Australia has [increased 25% (and 33% in arid Western Australia) since 1900](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/change/#tabs=Tracker&amp;tracker=timeseries&amp;tQ=graph%3Drain%26area%3Daus%26season%3D0112%26ave_yr%3D10). Climate models also disagree about if places will dry out with one model showing a particular area drying out and another showing that same area [getting soaked with additional rain](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-what-climate-models-tell-us-about-future-rainfall). But if the past is anything to go by, deserts are probably going to get smaller, not bigger.

So why does this myth live on? It's because the picture of lush fertile fields being turned into lifeless sand dunes is powerful emotionally and the media is in the business of selling doom and gloom.The Desertification Scare"
0,"I was interested in seeing how much of my superannuation money was being used to support fossil fuels, so I wrote to them and here’s their reply...
 

Good Afternoon Juanito

Thanks for your e-mail.

We believe that the most successful companies are those that consider the long-term sustainability of their business, not just the short-term drivers of current profitability.

We have always felt strongly about taking a thoughtful approach, not just in relation the impact of fossil fuels on climate change or animal cruelty, but to all Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and their implications on our ability to deliver high-quality, sustainable income to all of our members with integrity. 

We don’t automatically avoid companies associated with a specific theme (such as fossil fuel, high carbon footprint, animal welfare). Instead, we consider the current ESG risks that a company is exposed to and consider how they are managing or reducing these risks. For example, we consider the company’s current state of a company’s carbon footprint and the market’s appreciation of that (as reflected in its share price), as well as its capability to improve that footprint over time. Where appropriate and practicable, we support those companies to undertake activities to transition their operations and workforce towards a new energy regime. 

Our portfolio holdings are disclosed on our website, which lists which companies we are currently invested in.

Details of our investment policy can be found in CSC’s online Factsheet “Stewardship: Sustainability through an investment lens”. 

In particular, I’d like to highlight:

1. We take a portfolio approach to all our risks. Exposure to fossil fuels and the broader issue of climate change is no different. We were the first Australian superannuation fund to open our portfolio to carbon footprint analysis by the Climate Change Institute. We measure this every year with an aim to support a robust energy transition over time.

2. Divestment in illegal and other activities. CSC divests from tobacco and cluster munitions manufacturers because engagement with such companies cannot reduce the risks of exposure and/or because the activity is contrary to Australian government regulations, sanctions, treaties or conventions 

3. Divestment is a last resort. Research has shown that divestment doesn’t achieve results as it can leave companies in the hands of short-term investors, who may focus on maximising short-term earnings, rather than sustainable long-term outcomes. This is also widely acknowledged as an important responsibility for long-term investors by the following global best practice initiatives:
• World Economic Forum’s blueprint for institutional investors
• UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investing (PRI) global responsible investment standards
• OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises

4. CSC plays an important role in the transition to renewable energy. We believe that long-term investors like CSC have an important role to play in the transition from ‘ old energy’ to the ‘new energy’ regime. We do this by supporting ‘old-energy’ companies relying on fossil fuels (with the capability to do so) to transition their operations and workforces effectively to the new-energy regime such as renewables. 

Example 1: Caltex
Caltex is invested in alternative energy technologies including wind and solar. Our agent’s engagement with the company gives us confidence that Caltex has a robust understanding of the science of climate change and are actively investing in measures to reduce emissions. Caltex has been acting in a way that demonstrates their commitment to playing a constructive role in the new carbon future. This includes initiatives that support the achievement of Australia’s 2030 climate change target and Paris Agreement commitments as detailed in Caltex’s Climate Change Policy Statement, February 2019 and latest Sustainability Report.

Example 2: Mineral Resources 
Mineral Resources’ core business is increasingly involved in the development and production of spodumene as part of the lithium supply chain – thus it is our understanding that CSC is investing in a company that is focused on the commodities that support the transition to a lower carbon economy. Further, Mineral Resources has developed its first prototype in carbon fibre dump truck trays, which weigh substantially less than traditional steel trays. We understand that this will reduce the number of trucks required, meaning less fuel, lower emissions, less tyres and less waste. 

5. We are active owners. This means we vote all of our shareholder resolutions on all companies we own - an indirect form of engagement. It also means we engage directly with companies to understand their strategies, (e.g. their appreciation of the impact of fossil fuels on climate change risk, the risks in their supply chain, any governance/ethical issues) and what they are doing to address it. This is handled through a range of external agents, including our investment managers, who have a specialised understanding of the particular nature and risks of each company within the context of their operation. 

For example, all of our investment managers have this requirement for engagement on ESG in their mandates with us. They meet regularly with the Chairs and Directors of investee companies, mostly on a one-on-one basis and the agenda includes all relevant ESG risks, including climate change and progress with respect to emission reduction targets and supply chains as is consistent with CSC requirements. We also draw on input from specialist ESG research houses, databases and advisers.

6. CSC invests directly in renewables. We invest a material share of our risk budgets in renewable energy technologies. For example, CSC’s exposure to wind farms represents 10% of our infrastructure portfolio exposure. This includes direct and indirect ownership of 6 wind farms in Australia, including a 50% interest in Macarthur Wind Farm, which is the largest windfarm in the Southern Hemisphere, providing energy for 181,000 households and saves 1.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases every year. 

I trust that the above has provided you sufficient detail on the basis for CSC’s position ethical investing.

I need to keep this class simple, but I also need it to be fun and engaging. I think I can keep it relatively simplified, but I have only a few ideas about how to keep it fun. I was curious about any advice you all might have. The budget for teaching aides is somewhat limited. Probably about 75-150 dollars. I will have a laptop with projection capabilities, but I want to heavily restrict the use of power points for the sake of maintaining attention. If I use my laptop it would probably be more for notes and cute graphics, cartoons, or some kind of educational games.

Mostly, I want the kids engaged and having fun. Suggested activities or experiments focused on these topics would be incredibly useful.

 Planning about 60-90 minutes for the event. Could do it for longer, but kids have short attention spans so I want to try and keep it relatively short. Overall my goal is to educate on fundamentally what climate change is. Where I am from people don't have very good education or oppurtunities, so my hope is by preparing these kids and their parents they will be more equipped to challenge climate change deniers.Need advice for a public climate change class."

0,"Renowned scientist have long been articulating that our planet’s ecosystems cannot sustain our contemporary irresponsible way of life (1). Even reputable economists, such as Klaus Wiegandt, former German manager and spokesperson of the Metro AG, acknowledge that the global, regional and often local ecology only plays a minor role in economic decision-making (2). Contemporary developments in our social-ecological systems are predominantly shaped by our economic imperative causing the ecological crisis in the first place. Since, however, these systems are inherently complex and interconnected, we ultimately will always have to pay the price as a species (3).

We have to regain our awareness about this connectedness with nature, as it was never lost to begin with, start playing by its rules again and assign a much higher importance to the (social-)ecological part of sustainability. One way to achieve that, which has gained increasing popularity recently, is to give back to our natural environment through the practice of afforestation. Large-scale tree planting events, such as the [one](https://teamtrees.org/) initiated by well-known youtuber Mr. Beast, may follow best intentions and certainly do not bring any harm compared to your average over-exploitation of natural resources of existing ecosystems. However, a large amount of planted trees does by far not automatically represent a forest entailing the expected ecosystem services.

A fully functioning, healthy forest is accompanied by a wide range of local flora, overlapping habitats for local fauna, species competition, different layers of vegetation including a nutritious topsoil and most of all it needs time. Given the adequate prerequisites, a forest then can foster biodiversity, regulate a micro-climate, contain the effects of natural disasters and erosion, stabilize coastal areas and riverbanks, and even supply its surrounding area with an improved water quality through its filtration abilities (4). In fact, the presence of utility and food forests has always been an important life-sustaining factor for rural villages in various regions around the globe (5). Nonetheless, even under the right circumstances, a newly planted forest could take 100 to 300 years until it develops such capabilities. Randomly planted groups of trees, especially mono-cultures, however, could even have contrary effects, as the decaying wood of dying trees, which lack the right conditions and diversity to strive, provide plenty of space and sustenance for pests and diseases to get out of control. A good example for this is [China’s Three-North Shelter Forest Program](https://www.theepochtimes.com/desertification-in-china_1521959.html) (also known as China’s Green Great Wall), which strives to hold back desertification. It got set back 20 years in efforts when the chosen, fast-growing tree species was wiped out by a wave of disease in the year 2000 (7).

The Japanese botanist and afforestation practitioner Akira Miyawaki found a [method](https://daily.jstor.org/the-miyawaki-method-a-better-way-to-build-forests/) to enhance the afforestation process in ways that the average time to generate a healthy and divers forest is reduced down to 25 years, based on the careful study of local plant ecology prior to the planting process. This time difference creates a huge advantage and makes afforestation a feasible option in our search for ways to alleviate environmental problems in a sustainable manner. Nevertheless, 25 years are still a long period compared to how much destruction of ecosystems can be caused through economic over-exploitation in the meantime. There are already organizations, such as [saytrees](http://saytrees.org/) or [Afforest](https://www.afforestt.com/), which already have incorporated the [Miyawaki method](https://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/en/csr/contribution/environment/activities03/activities03-02.html) and somewhat accomplished to make a business model out it. However, it starts with us and it is not difficult, nor does it require great amounts of land. It takes as much as your average backyard and a little bit of effort in the beginning. Afterwards, a well-functioning forest needs no maintenance cost but offers long-term benefits to everyone. The motto should be: No management is the best management.

0,"I’m working on a project to create a device that could be used in homes or by businesses to contain the negative effects of plastic bags/films and straws.  I’d love to tap into the collective brainpower of this group to make the idea even better.  As a disclaimer, I don’t believe this idea is a perfect solution – rather it’s meant as a stop gap to contain the negative effects of these plastics until better plastic alternatives become more widely used.

Plastic bags/films are nearly unavoidable – buy a shirt online?  It comes in a plastic bag.  Food?  Plastic bags.  Kitchen gadget?  Also comes in a plastic bag.  Similarly plastic straws don’t seem to be going away quickly enough.  The worst part about this is that (at least in the US) most recycling programs can’t process these plastics as they jam the machines and don’t create much recyclable material.  Plastic films are also more likely to get caught and blown away in the wind and have a much larger negative impact on wildlife then other plastic materials (confused for food, suffocates the animals, etc).

I’m in the process now of designing a product that could help reduce these effects and could be mass produced for use at home or in businesses (imagine something with the electrical needs of a 110v kitchen appliance).  Users could stuff their plastic bags/film into it, close the door and hit a button that would then melt down the plastic into a block of plastic.  This block of plastic would be smaller, less like to blow away, and less harmful to wildlife.  I’d love to also have a setting so the product could be used to mitigate the harmful effects of straws on wildlife (again melt it into a block or perhaps heat it enough to soften and then press it.  This straw option could be a good option for restaurants that still use plastic straws but want to reduce the negative impact.

I’d love to get thoughts/input from this community.  
1) First, the initial idea – is it appealing and do you think it’s something the general population would be interested in?  I don't know if I'm trying to solve a problem that mostly bothers me (just plastic films as opposed to all the various kinds of plastic we use), or if this would be appealing to the general public as well.

2) If the idea takes off, I’d love to figure out an easy way for these blocks of plastic to be reused or recycled.  Straws are nearly always made from Polypropylene but the blocks made from straws may have residual syrups (from soda) within them – could they still be reused in some way?  Plastic bags/films are typically made from HDPE or LDPE but I don’t expect a “normal” user to separate their bags by type of plastic.  Could combinations of HDPE and LDPE be reused in some way?

3) Given that we’ll be melting these plastics into what is essentially a mold, is there a shape that could be used that would make the item instantly useful?  For example imagine if the output of the machine were plastics blocks that can be used as building materials?  That would be amazing!  Our machines would be much smaller likely couldn’t be able to handle enough plastic at one time to create these blocks, but it would be amazing if a similarly useful material could be created by thousands of homes using this product and then donated so that they can be put to use.

Any productive thoughts, ideas, or guidance to improve and expand on this idea would be greatly appreciated!Your input and ideas needed! A step in the right direction for plastic films and straws?"

I have found this video on youtube trends and it made me think about the whole EV situation: [https://youtu.be/TuLE7CcSvRc](https://youtu.be/TuLE7CcSvRc) 

1. EV infrastructure is not ready

While EV's sound nice on the paper, thinking about changing to 70-80% of EV instead of conventional cars it wouldnt be possible without alot of new infrastructure = additional CO2

2. EV are expensive

Only a few number of people can afford it. How should this change our CO2 emissions if people in poor countries drive with old heavily fuel consuming cars. We are on the same planet!!

3. CO2 Backpack

Those electric cars with more and more range waste alot of ressources in the battery production and carry a huge co2 backpack..

I think its a great concept, dont get all the hate..

what about you ? opinions please.Can full electrical cars change the environment or are they making it worse ?"

A catch: The GOP remains as beholden as ever to business and fossil-fuel interests, and that shows in the policies it’s pushing, like planting trees and carbon-capture systems. Conspicuously, none of the measures demand that fossil-fuel plants or automakers begin cranking down their emissions today.

What the Dems should do: Democrats should support the measures. Why?

0,"Australia is on fire. Since June 2019 the “Forever fires”, as they are unofficially called, have been burning through the continent, with flames as high as 70 m tall. At the time of recording the fire has destroyed 10.7 million hectares of bush, forest and parks, killing 28 people - including 3 volunteer firefighter [1], and an estimated 1 billion animals [2]. To put that into context; the total area of the fires to date is 80% the size of England, and 4 times the size of Massachusetts. However, they are spread across the country making fighting the blaze extremely tough.

Hot, dry weather combined with prolonged drought and strong winds have created the perfect conditions for fire to spread rapidly. Not to mention the 40°C temperatures and strong winds, which have only exacerbated the issue. [3]

On the idyllic coastal getaway of Mallacoota, fires forced residents to flee to the beach on December 31st, with only a change in the wind direction keeping the fire from reaching them on the shore.
Evacuations via Black Hawk helicopters and naval vessels took place on January 2nd and 3rd to whisk holidaymakers and residents away from the area.
The military has also sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts.[3,4]
What does the Data Show

Bushfire is an integral part of the Australian ecosystem, with many of its plants and species evolving alongside seasonal fires [5]. But the past 20 years have seen different trends; the fires are more frequent, more eruptive and more damaging. Suggesting that climate change has made favourable conditions for the fire to spread.

The summer of 2019 has been especially hot, with the all time temperature record being broken at an atonishing 41.9 degrees celsius. 
The other main climate driver is the Indian Ocean Dipole or IOD. Which describes a difference in ocean surface temperature between the western and eastern sides of the Indian ocean, where the warmer side receives more rainfall and the colder side receives less [5] A positive IOD event results in a wetter eastern Africa and a drier Australia. A similar dipole exists in the Pacific ocean and is known as “El Nino”. The  Indian Ocean Dipole is usually stable about the mean ocean temperature, but occasionally can fluctuate to extreme negative or positive dipoles, causing extreme weather known as IOD events. However, Since 1980 there has only been a few negative IOD events and many consecutive positive IODs events. The strongest of which occurred Oct 2019, during the “Forever fires”. [3,4,6]

If you think the dipole causing extreme weather in Australia should also cause extreme weather in east Africa, then you’d be right. From October to November the horn of Africa has seen rainfall up to 300% above seasonal averages. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, nearly 3 million people have been affected and at least 280 have died as a result of the floods [7]. 

Ad lib Tim: bit we didn’t see nearly so much coverage of this in the news?


To illustrate exactly how unprecedented these extreme weather events are, we need only to take a glimpse from the past. Since we started industrially mining fossil fuels to drive our rapid technological progress, the number of natural disasters per year has increased dramatically. As scientists have predicted, this is a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions [8]. Anthropogenic meaning “originating from human activity”.

This link between the frequency of natural disasters, climate change and emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gasses has been growing stronger for the last 30 years, since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published their first assessment reports [9]. Recently however, scientists have been able to study the effects of climate change on specific disasters [10], with a conclusive scientific consensus between this link [11]. Regarding Australia and the Indian Ocean Dipole, a paper published in nature geoscience 2008, has studied the coral records in the Indian Ocean and found that the strength and frequency of positive IOD events has increased during the 20th century as a result of anthropogenic greenhouse gases [12]. This suggests that natural disasters such as the fires in Australia, are worsened and potentially even caused by anthropogenic climate change.


Due to climate change, Australia has already become 1 degree celsius hotter since 1910 [3,13]. This trend is likely to continue to over 4 degrees by 2100, if Australia’s bare bones climate policies are upheld [14].  Lack of climate action in Australia can be directly linked to the counties economic dependency on the fossil fuel industry. With 60% of its energy supply from burning coal and 20% from gas [15]. Coal production in Australia increased 13.6% between 2005 and 2010. With 75% of the coal mined being exported over the Great Barrier Reef to Eastern Asia, making Australia the largest global exporter [16]. In total this accounts for a significant 4.2% of GDP, and employs almost 2% of the workforce [17]. Although the industry is slowly declining due to pressure from environmental groups [18], there is so much economic reliance on the mining industry in general - 8.5% GDP [19] Australia is highly unlikely to meet 1.5 degrees conditions set by the IPCC [special report 1.5 degrees IPCC]. 


The total damage and economic loss is estimated to exceed $100 billion US dollars [20], about 5.3% of Australia’s GDP in 2019. This is including the 32 billion dollars in lost tourism for the next 3 years, and over $500 million in insurance losses estimated by the Insurance Council of Australia. These costs are expected to rise as the fires continue. Australia’s inaction on climate change may certainly be due to their economic dependence on their lucrative mining industry, but what Australian policymakers are failing to recognise is that the economic opportunity of acting against climate change, and reducing the impact of disasters, is potentially enormous!

Unfortunately Australia's government, lead by Scott Morrison, has not engaged with the climate crisis; so much so that they received the satirical Fossil of the Day award from the Climate Action Network at COP25, in recognition of Morrision claiming that the bushfires are unconnected to climate change, and that Australia doing more on climate change would not change the outcomes of the fire. COP25 was the second meeting of the parties to the Paris agreement, and the 25th UN Climate Conference. Australia has promised to reduce emissions by 26% by 2030, but it plans to get 90% of the way there using carbon credits earned through the Kyoto protocol, where Australia was allowed to actually increase emissions. Effectively claiming they only have to achieve 10% of their Paris Agreement Targets [22]. Australia was accused of cheating, and along with Brazil and America created a political deadlock from which no agreement could be met. In fact, Costa Rica’s environment and energy minister Carlos Manuel Rodríguez called out Australia, Brazil and the US for blocking progress, stating: “Some of the positions are totally unacceptable because they are inconsistent with the commitment and the spirit that we were able to agree upon [in Paris in 2015],” he said.

“On the last day of the Cop we should be very concerned because that high ambition for environmental integrity is being threatened by the lack of agreement,” he warned. [23]

Why Should you Care
Global climate is in the name, “Global”. The causes and effects of the Australian wildfires are not contained wholly to Australia; and the same goes for emissions from their mining industries. The carbon emissions from these most recent fires have already emitted more than 400 million metric tonnes of CO2, and has released smoke covering more than 20 million square km [24]. That’s just bigger than Russia and more than double the size of America [25]. 
This disaster has contributed a significant amount to co2 into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change. Additionally the smoke released is a major health hazard that will impact communities across australia, new zealand and possibly south america [3].
Given the interconnectedness of our nations, thanks to the world trade organisation, natural disasters are expensive to economies, locally and internationally. They also increase our greenhouse emissions either directly, in this case by burning carbon sinks, or indirectly by carbon cost of aid, re-location, and re-building. Of course, these costs are necessary after a natural disaster, however, in the long run it is cheaper to prevent than it is to repair.
What You Can Do
We’ve shown how human driven climate change is causing natural disasters to increase in frequency and strength, and this trend is likely to increase if we continue business as normal. So what can you do to reduce the impact of disasters, and lessen the intensity of future ones?
Improve family and community preparedness by knowing your community disaster plan, and having a family disaster plan and be prepared to execute it. Follow the FEMA link in the description to start creating a strategy for your family - especially if you live in a disaster prone region.
You can actively act against climate change, by seeking ways in which to reduce your carbon footprint, such as: eating less meat, cycle or use public transport to commute, grow some of your own vegetables or taking less international flights, to name a few.
Supporting sustainable community projects that help adapt to climate change. This includes sustainable community gardens and sustainable community businesses. You can also help by funding larger projects globally that help the environment and supporting the local economy. [26]
There are a large number of organisations aiding in the firefighting and recovery efforts. Different organisations help different aspects of the crisis from the protection of wildlife to helping the firefighting and evacuation effort [2,27]. If you can’t afford to donate money you can still raise awareness by sharing this story.

0,"Hi everyone, I'm wondering if anybody is aware of any studies on how we can expect threats from crossing multiple planetary boundaries to compound one another over the coming century.  Assuming we get the [most likely outcome on climate change](https://www.carbonbrief.org/profound-shifts-underway-in-energy-system-says-iea-world-energy-outlook) \- a middle ground between total apocalypse and meeting the targets which require a cliff drop in emissions starting now (say 2.5-3.5°C by 2100) - how do these impacts interact with the most likely [continued drop off in biodiversity](https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/inline/files/ipbes_global_assessment_report_summary_for_policymakers.pdf), soil degradation and water scarcity?  What does this century look like for human well being in various regions of the world, assuming modest progress without miracles and considering more than one of these issues in isolation?

Part of my reason for asking is that I've settled over recent years on an expectation that life is going to get pretty tough for us as these crises converge while we try to support a population of 10 billion.  It leads me to think that starting a family is not the responsible choice - I need more evidence that we can provide for ourselves sustainably before throwing more people into this.  

The conversation tends to be dominated by extremes - the unthinkable failure scenarios, last chances, and the hope that we can pull together in an unprecedented, action movie style, last-minute turn around.  The most probable outcome is neither of those things, and I'm interested in understanding whether that leads to a hellish warscape with food scarcity within the lifetime of someone born today in a developed nation.  

Here's an article I see as a [realistic mid ground](https://about.bnef.com/blog/peak-emissions-are-closer-than-you-think-and-heres-why/) on climate, but it makes no consideration of the other physical limits we're pressing up against.  How you synthesise and interpret news from these siloed disciplines determines whether you end up in r/collapse thinking.  I know several clued up people on here who look at the constraints of the global economy, dependence on unsustainable industrial agriculture, extinction rates and locked-in climate impacts and conclude that humanity has already overshot carrying capacity and is due for a crash, and they make a compelling case.  That's not a scenario to send new humans into.  I'm not looking for hopeful thoughts, but for decent evidence to improve the accuracy of my world outlook.

The images of children covering their heads in plastic water bottles and people wrapped in plastic bags trying to avoid the virus is gut wrenching. The saddest part is seeing how racism towards asians is popping up all over the world instead of solidarity and empathy, I guess this is when the true self reveals itself. I'm so amazed at the Italians for all the research and understanding they've done of the virus, they've helped not only to the Chinese but the world because this thing is impacting all of us. The world is a small place and we need to work together if we want to see thru this.

I think that the ETS seems to be one of the best examples for systems of reducing carbon emissions that I've seen but I still have four questions that I'm trying to wrap my head around.

1. At what level does a company begin emitting enough carbon that it must participate in the ETS?
2. How does the EU decide and justify how many allowances are given to each individual market?
3. Is there any socioeconomic unfairness to the ETS? I hear often the general public (not necessarily informed individuals) say that the ETS can be harmful to small businesses because bigger companies can just pay up.
4. I've also heard that it's possible for large companies to find loopholes in the system and continue to engage in harmful environmental practices. I'm not sure how they would find loopholes or what those would be. It seems to me that the whole point of the system is that it gives companies the opportunity to strategize by either banking for future use, or selling their allowances. That doesn't really seem like a loophole. If anybody could shed some light on that I'd really appreciate it!

0,"The Salton Sea, located inland in Southern California, is an environmental disaster that seems like something from an earlier time, when human activities were making our great bodies of water unfit for life.

The sea was created by accident. In 1905, a canal in the Imperial Valley smashed through its banks, resulting in a torrent of water flooding into a low lying valley. By the time the spill was stopped, 2 years later, a sea was formed. For a time, the area prospered. It became a popular vacation destination for SoCal residents. 

But by the 80s, things took a turn for the worse. The rivers that fed the Salton were polluted with agricultural runoff, and as the sea has no outlets, this pollution had no place to go. Over time, the water got dirtier and dirtier. The lack of an outlet also meant it got saltier. The Salton became increasingly unable to support life. In the 90s, thousands of birds died from eating botulism infested fish and in 1999, 8 million tilapia died in one day.

In September 2012, residents in Los Angeles noticed a putrid odor, like raw eggs. What happened was the Salton, 150 miles away, had a great die-off of fish, which released a tremendous amount of sulfur gas. 

You might imagine that environmentally minded Californians would do something about this, but you'd be wrong. In fact, they've made it worse. Imperial County recently agreed to transfer more water to San Diego, [the result being 40% less water for the Salton Sea.](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433294/salton-sea-crisis-drying-up-asthma-toxic-dust-pictures) 

As the Sea dries up, even more bad things are apt to happen. The seabed is filled with toxic dust filled with heavy metals. The wind will be able to blow this harmful dust all over Southern California. 

Plans to dig a canal to the Gulf of California or install desalination plants have been shelved due to cost. [In 2018, voters approved $200 million](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3879) to manage the Sea's decline by suppressing the dust of the newly exposed ""playa"". Whether this will work is an open question and even if the toxic dust is stopped, there's still the loss of habitat for fish and birds, the loss of tourism that the sea once provided, and that morbid stench that will serve as a reminder of the consequences of man's hubris.The Salton Sea Disaster"

The Exxon Valdez oil spill was a manmade disaster that occurred when *Exxon Valdez*, an oil tanker owned by the Exxon Shipping Company, spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska’s Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989. It was the worst oil spill in U.S. history until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The Exxon Valdez oil slick covered 1,300 miles of coastline and killed hundreds of thousands of seabirds, otters, seals and whales. Nearly 30 years later, pockets of crude oil remain in some locations. After the spill, Exxon Valdez returned to service under a different name, operating for more than two decades as an oil tanker and ore carrier.

On the evening of March 23, 1989, *Exxon Valdez* left the port of Valdez, [Alaska](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/alaska), bound for Long Beach, [California](https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/california), with 53 million gallons of Prudhoe Bay crude oil onboard.

At four minutes after midnight on March 24, the ship struck Bligh Reef, a well-known navigation hazard in Alaska’s Prince William Sound.

The impact of the collision tore open the ship’s hull, causing some 11 million gallons of crude oil to spill into the water.

At the time, it was the largest single oil spill in U.S. waters. Initial attempts to contain the oil failed, and in the months that followed, the oil slick spread, eventually covering about 1,300 miles of coastline.

Investigators later learned that Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of *Exxon Valdez*, had been drinking at the time and had allowed an unlicensed third mate to steer the massive ship.

In March 1990, Hazelwood was acquitted of felony charges. He was convicted of a single charge of misdemeanor negligence, fined $50,000, and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service.

## Oil Spill Cleanup

In the months after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Exxon employees, federal responders and more than 11,000 Alaska residents worked to clean up the oil spill.

Exxon payed about $2 billion in cleanup costs and $1.8 billion for habitat restoration and personal damages related to the spill.

Cleanup workers skimmed oil from the water’s surface, sprayed oil dispersant chemicals in the water and on shore, washed oiled beaches with hot water and rescued and cleaned animals trapped in oil.

Environmental officials purposefully left some areas of shoreline untreated so they could study the effect of cleanup measures, some of which were unproven at the time. They later found that aggressive washing with high-pressure, hot water hoses was effective in removing oil, but did even more ecological damage by killing the remaining plants and animals in the process.

One of those areas that was oiled but never cleaned is a large shoreline boulder called Mearn’s Rock. Scientists have returned to Mearn’s Rock every summer since the spill to photograph the plants and small critters growing on it. They found that many of the mussels, barnacles and various seaweeds growing on the rock before the spill returned to normal levels about three to four years after the spill.

## Environmental And Economic Impacts

Prince William Sound had been a pristine wilderness before the spill. The Exxon Valdez disaster dramatically changed all of that, taking a major toll on wildlife. It killed an estimated 250,000 sea birds, 3,000 otters, 300 seals, 250 bald eagles and 22 killer whales.

The oil spill also may have played a role in the collapse of salmon and herring fisheries in Prince William Sound in the early 1990s. Fishermen went bankrupt, and the economies of small shoreline towns, including Valdez and Cordova, suffered in the following years.

Some reports estimated the total economic loss from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to be as much as $2.8 billion.

A 2001 study found oil contamination remaining at more than half of the 91 beach sites tested in Prince William Sound.

The spill had killed an estimated 40 percent of all sea otters living in the Sound. The sea otter population didn’t recover to its pre-spill levels until 2014, twenty-five years after the spill.

Stocks of herring, once a lucrative source of income for Prince William Sound fisherman, have never fully rebounded.

## Oil Pollution Act of 1990

In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which President [George H.W. Bush](http://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/george-bush) signed into law that year.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 increased penalties for companies responsible for oil spills and required that all oil tankers in United States waters have a double hull.

*Exxon Valdez* was a single-hulled tanker; a double-hull design, by making it less likely that a collision would have spilled oil, might have prevented the Exxon Valdez disaster.

## Fate of Exxon Valdez

The ship, *Exxon Valdez*—first commissioned in 1986—was repaired and returned to service a year after the spill in a different ocean and under a different name.

The single-hulled ship could no longer transport oil in U.S. waters, due to the new regulations. The ship began running oil transport routes in Europe, where single-hulled oil tankers were still allowed. There it was renamed the *Exxon Mediterranean*, then the *SeaRiver Mediterranean* and finally the *S/R Mediterranean.*

In 2002, the European Union banned single-hulled tankers and the former *Exxon Valdez* moved to Asian waters.

Exxon sold the infamous tanker in 2008 to a Hong Kong-based shipping company. The company converted the old oil tanker to an ore carrier, renaming it the *Dong Feng Ocean*. In 2010, the star-crossed ship collided with another bulk carrier in the Yellow Sea and was once again severely damaged.

The ship was renamed once more after the collision, becoming the *Oriental Nicety*. The *Oriental Nicety* was sold for scrap to an Indian company and dismantled in 2012.The Exxon Valdez oil spill"

It's not the lack of technology, will, or money that is preventing our society from taking action against climate change. Apart from few notable exceptions, almost every company and government today acknowledges the need to act immediately - but they still cannot do it at the scale and speed required.

**What we are missing is coordination at a global scale, as well as systematic planning and execution.**

The Restore Project is an apolitical and independent initiative that aims to solve this.

However, to make it possible everyone needs to be involved: companies, governments, institutions, investors, the scientific community, and – most importantly – the people.

Our aim is to unite them all towards a specific goal, providing a strategy and a set of solutions that allow for immediate global action.

About how we plan to do that:

* Climate experts, scientists and engineers will be involved to identify the most appropriate technologies and solutions to implement;
* We will devise the most effective strategies to realise such solutions at a global and national scale – also directly working with governments, companies and institutions to speed up and facilitate their realisation;
* Investments will be concentrated in the most impactful projects aiming to solve the root causes of climate change;
* To maximise global impact, we plan to join forces with existing initiatives all over the world.

# Final remarks

We know this may look like a crazy and impossible plan, but **it is technically feasible and it represents the most logical approach** to achieve immediate global action. Current solutions and countermeasures are not working fast enough or at the scale required, so something must be urgently done.

I travel for business - typically 7 transoceanic flights per year. Last year I reduced it as much as I could - down to 3. Even then I blamed my employer - “I HAD to go...”

I feel like I should have a little less guilt, but those planes still took off. In order for an airline to cancel a route, it would have to become unprofitable - and that would take a LOT more people than just me. 

Recently I wanted to take a weekend getaway to a nearby city and looked into alternatives.

Flying (economy)	$150	1.5 hours
Driving	$120	11 hours
Train (economy)	$200	9 hours

My partner asked me how much quality of life I was willing to give up to avoid flying - especially since those planes are still going to take off with or without us. And I see her point... will we never travel outside our city again?

We’d put the piles of weeds in the garbage (which isn’t good at all).

0,"It has occurred to me that though I am heavily in favour of action on climate change, there are considerations beyond just scrapping carbon emissions totally. Contingencies and alternatives for the global economy. Green energy is obviously the most developed net-zero industry with the many applicable and cheap options now for energy generation alternatives to fossil fuels. That has to be a long-term focus and perhaps a policy that all countries become signatories of, agreeing to replace their energy systems entirely with renewable, net-zero alternatives. It certainly is possible, in comparison to some other things I will mention. 

For transportation, it appears at least to me, that electric vehicles, electric trains, electric trucks have been positioned as easily employable and comparable alternatives to their fossil fuel counterparts. In the case of electric cars, it is actually [marginally cheaper in terms of cost per mile](https://pod-point.com/guides/driver/cost-of-charging-electric-car) (depending on where you live) for road users than diesel or petrol cars. Still, offsetting range for the environment is acceptable under casual terms of using a car. For cargo vehicles, I don’t believe the current technology can match the demand of the industry. As with haulage for example, Tesla’s electric semi-truck is Said to offer 620 miles range unloaded and between 300-500 miles unloaded. For short-distance cargo, these ranges sound ideal, but for long-range haulage these trucks will not be able to replace the role of trucks powered by fossil fuels on journeys such as those that take a truck across the United States or across Europe without refuelling. A 30 minute charge time every 300-500 miles is not option for an industry that already runs on the very edge of time. It doesn’t appear that there can be a trade off on time for businesses and deliveries.

Planes - The commercial and civil aviation industry isn’t as big a source of emissions as many people think - 2.4% of total fossil fuel Emissions and 17% of transport emissions - still significant and it will continue to grow extensively. Commercial aviation has changed the world and the benefits are everywhere - shrinking distances between continents for work and tourism, fast and safe travel, express deliveries around the world for deliveries that really are urgent. Without being too conscientious, it’s safe to say that without some revolution in aircraft design, the civil and commercial aviation industry will die to satisfy net-zero carbon concerns; something that needs to happen if it is to save the planet but it would be a huge shame to lose the benefits of. The world has enjoyed these benefits for so many years now that its grow to work around this Industry.

Climate action is necessary, but there are has to be some serious planning put into it. Governments have to unanimously commit to it, and the world needs some serious innovations. I don’t feel there is a compromise on any of this. The economy and energy generation need to adapt and innovate together, and one cannot suffer because of the other. People’s lives are at stake in both cases - in energy and the climate. That is again, why the global effort needs to be focused on it - the task ahead is more than just achieving a carbon-zero world; its achieving a carbon-zero world, finding energy alternatives for transport that are comparable or better in terms of performance than current carbon ones and doing all this whilst not tanking the global economy.What will the World need to give up to become net-zero in carbon emissions?"

Since you apparently need a relevant degree in the area to speak toward the subject of fossil fuel divestment, I feel my BS in Finance and MBA in Financial Analytics more than qualify me to tell Mnunchin and those who feel similarly that continued heavy investment in fossil fuels is not just climatologically illiterate, but recklessly stupid from a purely economic standpoint. Since I am a data-driven person who does my best to rely on facts to substantiate my opinions rather than heresay, fallacies, a number of intentional non-considerations, and outright lies, here's a small body of leading research that discusses and substantiates divestment from fossil fuels not only to address the anthropogenic climate risks, but also the gargantuan economic risks which come alongside it. Don't take my word on it, though, read for yourselves. Here's a few key excerpts, links included:

""This paper makes the case for divestment as a proper financial response by investment trustees to current market conditions and to the outlook facing the coal, oil and gas sectors. It is driven principally by the likelihood that future returns from the fossil fuel sector will not replicate past performance. The financial case for fossil fuel divestment is strong. Over the past three and five years, respectively, global stock indexes without fossil fuel holdings have outperformed otherwise identical indexes that include fossil fuel companies. Fossil fuel companies once led the economy and world stock markets. They now lag... After oil prices crashed in 2014, oil company revenues plummeted, expensive capital investments failed, massive amounts of reserves were written off as no longer economic, and major bankruptcies occurred.

""A recent analysis by Jeremy Grantham,  co-founder and chief investment  strategist of Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo, one of the largest asset management firms in the world, tested  how an investment portfolio would be  affected by divesting from a group of companies that are listed in the  Standard &amp; Poor’s 500.

0,"Climate change is a problem that we must face, but unfounded hysterical predictions do not help at all. Let's start with the big one: no, a rise in temperatures is not going to kill us. We humans can survive and thrive in some very hot climates, just look at Phoenix or Dubai. Let's remember what's causing this climate crisis, it's our rising standard of living, and that same rising standard of living will mean the now-poor people in equatorial regions will probably be able to afford air conditioning by the middle of this century. Life will go on, it's just that more of it will go on indoors. 

It's likely that some places will become unable to support agriculture, but there are many places that due to a longer growing season will be able to support more agriculture. Also, we've got technological progress on the horizon which will mean we no longer need farms to provide food in the form of [cellular agriculture.](https://www.new-harvest.org/cell_ag_101) 

Climate change will bring many problems, namely more extreme storms and greater risk of floods, but based on the most likely trend in carbon emissions, they are nothing we can't adapt to. We will survive just fine.No, We Are Not Going to Go Extinct"

Since you apparently need a relevant degree in the area to speak toward the subject of fossil fuel divestment, I feel my BS in Finance and MBA in Financial Analytics more than qualify me to tell Mnunchin and those who feel similarly that continued heavy investment in fossil fuels is not just climatologically illiterate, but recklessly stupid from a purely economic standpoint. Since I am a data-driven person who does my best to rely on facts to substantiate my opinions rather than heresay, fallacies, a number of intentional non-considerations, and outright lies, here's a small body of leading reports that discuss and confirm divestment from fossil fuels not only to address the anthropogenic climate risks, but also the gargantuan economic risks which come alongside it. Don't take my word on it, though, read for yourselves. Here's a few key excerpts, links included:

""This paper makes the case for divestment as a proper financial response by investment trustees to current market conditions and to the outlook facing the coal, oil and gas sectors. It is driven principally by the likelihood that future returns from the fossil fuel sector will not replicate past performance. The financial case for fossil fuel divestment is strong. Over the past three and five years, respectively, global stock indexes without fossil fuel holdings have outperformed otherwise identical indexes that include fossil fuel companies. Fossil fuel companies once led the economy and world stock markets. They now lag... After oil prices crashed in 2014, oil company revenues plummeted, expensive capital investments failed, massive amounts of reserves were written off as no longer economic, and major bankruptcies occurred. This decline exposed long-standing weaknesses in the industry’s investment thesis, which was to assume that a company’s value was determined by the number of barrels of oil (reserves) it owned. In the new investment environment, cash is king, which creates a conundrum for the industry. Aggressive acquisition and drilling will likely lead to more losses for investors. If oil and gas companies pull back, on the other hand, and acknowledge the likelihood of lower future returns and more modest growth patterns, their actions will only confirm the industry is shrinking financially.

I've struggled with confidence and anxiety for quite a while and I have found the transition to Uni to be somewhat difficult, although I've found my housemates in 3rd year to be really supportive and in particular my housemate Sophie.  


With climate change being front page news, with many local governments declaring a climate emergency, I decided that I wanted to do something to help raise awareness whilst also going out of my comfort zone and challenging myself. I managed to find out about the World Naked Bike Ride - a fantastic peaceful protest ride in towns and cities across the UK to raise awareness for the vulnerability of cyclists and remove dependence on fossil fuels.  


After some research I decided to take the plunge and take part in the London ride last summer. After chatting about it with Sophie she decided that she would also be keen to take part as a keen environmentalist and also to provide me with some support. The ride is classified 'as bare as you dare' so we both agreed that we wouldn't go the full hog but we would ride in our underwear.  


We got an early train up to London with our bikes and made our way to sunny Hyde Park and joined everyone else for the start of the ride. We both got ready in Hyde Park where I stripped down to just my boxers whilst Sophie stripped down to just a pair of knickers.  


The ride was absolutely amazing with so many people being so supportive with a common core value of helping to protect the environment, and the ride helped me so much with my confidence and anxiety issues - I'm so grateful to have Sophie as a friend and I would urge anyone who is struggling with anxiety to look to their circle of friends for support! University can be difficult but there are always people who are willing to listen.

Many economists on the left argue that such deficit spending is not only ""worth it"": It's actually economically beneficial. One of them, Randall Wray, just testified in front of Congress about this. He is the co-author of a groundbreaking paper, [""How to Pay for the Green New Deal.""](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf)

I think it's really important for environmentalists like me to understand this, so that we cannot be scared by fiscal conservatives claiming ""expertise"" into diluting a climate budget. However, most literature is a bit dense for new learners, so I'm working on infographics to break down the ideas.

This infographic explains Sector Balance, part of the reason why U.S. deficits are beneficial. To my knowledge, sector balance itself is accepted by most mainstream economists, as the data is clear.

Some will disagree, and that's O.K. My hope is not to convince but to spark curiosity, and encourage environmentalists to empower themselves with economics. We will need massive spending to save the planet, and we should not be ashamed of it.

In the 60s and 70s, things were really, really bad. Our rivers and lakes were being rendered lifeless as they filled with raw sewage and industrial effluent. New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was blunt in his assessment of the Hudson River. “The river from Troy to the south of Albany is one great septic tank that has been rendered nearly useless for water supply, for swimming, or to support the rich fish life that once abounded there.” There were advisories against swimming in the Great Lakes. The Cuyahoga river, famously, caught fire 13 times.

Our air was also being poisoned by emissions from automobile exhausts, garbage incinerators, and power plants. Southern California was blanketed with a thick layer of photochemical smog. A smog event over Thanksgiving 1966 in New York killed 168 people. 

The pesticide DDT was ravaging bird populations. It brought the Bald Eagle to the brink of extinction. 

Even Richard Nixon was speaking in dire terms about the nation's environment. In 1970, he said that if nothing was done, many urban areas would be uninhabitable by 1980.

It's now 2020. Our air is clean even over our largest cities. Our rivers and lakes are once again teeming with life. Bird populations have recovered.

Bugs, fish, birds and human are being poisoned. All are affected cognitively and sexually. The consequences of the Bayer, Monsanto, [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=monsanto+paid+google+to+bury+unfavorable+news&amp;rlz=1C1EXJR_enCA869CA869&amp;oq=monanto+paid+google+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2.14243j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) axis of evil will affect us for generations. We are going extinct as a species. Males of all vertebrate classes are becoming female and sterile. Their bones and penises are shrinking away. It takes just 3 of Bayer's neonic seeds to kill one bird, and it's water soluble. But, no one single chemical is to blame, and no one studies their cumulative synergies. Most chemicals, are not tested for safety. 

Scientists have know this for some time, but are not allowed to publicly speak out, especially when it comes to PFAS etc. Academic scientific fraud runs rampant. Elizabeth Warren is Harvard's first professor of color, if that is not academic fraud what is.

[However, when the opposition party was voted in the following year, the newly elected mayor attempted to have the new restrictions lifted.](https://themilsource.com/madrids-low-emissions-zone-has-dropped-pollution-to-10-year-low-report-says/)Madrid’s low-emissions zone has dropped pollution to 10-year low, report says"
0,"After the Camp Fire in California, which burned down the town of Paradise in November 2018, are rice fields downstream polluted?

I am imagining that with the utter destruction of the fire (11k homes burned down), an ungodly amount of pollution has been washed downstream into the Sacramento River and the like. 

I am concerned about eating rice grown near the water runoff, like Lundberg Rice. 

Do I need to be concerned? I dont want to avoid eating rice if I don't need to.Contaminated rice after California wildfires"

I have also delayed my plans to pursue my masters because of the same.What are some major firms that are working towards tackling climate change?"
0,"All the news articles I have been reading say that China no longer accepts our recycling trash. What is happening with the trash that we are recycling? My township always required 3 trash bins, one for paper , one for plastic/glass and the one for trash. I don’t understand why should I continue to recycle if the recycling is going to trash anyways.

This account is run by a blogger based in London. She gives fantastic tips on how to live a more ethical and sustainable life alongside some beautiful photography.

[**@weareallseed**](https://www.instagram.com/weareallseed/)

Although I know there are alot of reasons for people not being able to do these things (money, physically and mentally unable etc) others don't really seem to give a f*ck. Like you see BK wrappers lying on the highway, Subway mugs on the sidewalk literally 6 feet away from the nearest trash bin.

So I guess what I want to ask is, why are people this ignorant?

We keep growing this deficit by liquidating  the Earth’s natural capital and accumulating waste, primarily carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere. Andrew Simms originally conceived the concept  of Earth Overshoot Day while working at the UK think tank New Economics  Foundation.

0,"“*A new cafe culture is brewing in the San Francisco area, where a growing number of coffee houses are banishing paper to-go cups and replacing them with everything from glass jars to rental mugs and BYO cup policies.”* ([https://apnews.com/1281f2663dbb80ce6775974aea85953f](https://apnews.com/1281f2663dbb80ce6775974aea85953f) )

I applaud the intent and effort of larger coffee and fast-food chains around the globe to be a bit more environmental but let’s, just for the sake of the environment, try to understand whether some of their news generating actions make sense or not. Instead of just believing that some action is good, we should KNOW, with enough confidence, that it is good.

*“It would take between 20 (…) and more than 1,000 (…) uses, depending on the cup/mug type and the environmental indicator, to make up for the impacts of a single-use cup. If a reusable cup is used fewer times than that, the single-use cup is better for the environment.”* ([https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/07/reusable-or-disposable-which-coffee-cup-has-a-smaller-footprint/](https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2017/07/reusable-or-disposable-which-coffee-cup-has-a-smaller-footprint/))

Up to 1000 uses = one cup once a day for almost three years! Easily doable yet how many cups, jars and mugs actually reach that milestone. Fortunately it’s not all bad news! Some of the ideas to consider in order to have even more meaningful impact:

* If you have to buy one then use the disposable coffee cup more than once — usually nothing drastic happens (it doesn’t run away or start biting) to it once your coffee is finished and, instead of just dropping it to bin, you can use it several times;
* Stop using lids on disposable coffee cup unless you are driving a car — you are the pinnacle of billions of years of evolution who can handle even the almost full coffee cup without spilling it (most of the time);
* Stop washing reusable cup in between every serving — a few drops of coffee in the bottom of your cup won’t affect the taste or quality of the next serving and your delicate avocado-celery-cucumber smoothie nursed digestive tract can most surely handle it as well;
* Have a number of reusable cups shared by everyone in your office, but not too many, as this makes the solution redundant. Caffeine, in spite of our occasional morning comments, is not a life saver, nothing will happen to a person who can’t get the caffeine dose immediately. But if you are well and truly hooked, and really can’t wait for it, then have your doctor write you a prescription to wave around in case you need to force a mug from someone’s hands;
* Stop drinking milk or plant based fluids with your holy dose of energizer — it really doesn’t matter if instead of robbing milk from baby cows you fill up your cup with almond or soya milk, those products all have heavy environmental impact;
* Drink less coffee and tea — every cup you consume means resources spent on the equipment to serve you, to heat up the water, to transport and prepare coffee beans or tea leafs for consumption as well as disposing the leftovers. Drinking tap water is a socially acceptable form of consuming liquids and extinguing thirst;
* While stocking the coffee corner of your office kitchen, you can ask your team members to bring their own mugs or even a couple of more used ones from their homes;
* Know that, while opening your dream come true bakery or coffee house, there is no law about how the coffee mugs in your bakery have to look like. So for example you can ask your family members and friends to dip in or ask your first customers to pay for their coffee with used items like coffee mugs, plates, cutlery and so on.

I’m sure that almost everyone can have a meaningful and smart impact once you really start thinking about the environment and instead of cruising on autopilot, change your behaviour and attitude. So why not start with something as simple as a cup of coffee?Banishing disposable coffee cups, does it always makes sense?"

0,"The New York Times recently published an article that [described China's](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage#commentsContainer) declining birth rate as a ""crisis"". They went through the normal handwringing about how there'd never be enough young people to support that country's aging population. The comments section rightly chewed them out for claiming that a country with 1.4 billion people needs even more. This sentiment is common and has been applied everywhere to tell us that we need more and more people or our aging population is going to bankrupt us.

Endless population growth to keep pensions solvent is like setting fire to your lawn to kill the gophers. There are many better ways to adapt. The reason why pensions are in crisis is because life expectancy has gone up, but the retirement age hasn't. We can solve this by indexing the retirement age to life expectancy. The Social Security Administration estimates that this reform, which would raise the retirement age about 1 month every 2 years, would stop the cost from [rising relative to taxable payroll after 2035](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/provisions/charts/chart_run107.html). Denmark has done this and it is projected to [save them a tremendous amount](https://oecdecoscope.blog/2019/01/15/ambitious-retirement-age-indexation-ensures-sustainable-public-finances-in-denmark/). 

We should also be optimistic that medical science will greatly reduce the cost of caring for the growing ranks of seniors. Let's take the most dreaded ailment of old age, dementia. It's a horrific disease for its victims and their loved ones. It's also staggeringly expensive, costing Medicare and Medicaid [$195 billion in 2019](https://act.alz.org/site/DocServer/2012_Costs_Fact_Sheet_version_2.pdf?docID=7161), as its sufferers generally require constant care for many years. Dementia only receives a fraction as much money in research as cancer or heart disease. If we could find an effective treatment or a cure, it would massively relieve the burden of the aging population.

Dementia happens to be part of a class of diseases caused by the misfolding of proteins. Other such diseases include Diabetes, Parkinson's, Cataracts and possibly [Multiple Sclerosis](https://www.mdedge.com/clinicalneurologynews/article/157658/multiple-sclerosis/ms-may-be-transmissible-protein-misfolding). Our ability to understand protein folding has been limited by the fact that a protein, in a fraction of a second, can fold in a number of ways that exceeds the number of [seconds since the Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinthal%27s_paradox). But those new fangled quantum computers could [efficiently crack this problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02163), providing us with the knowledge needed to tame these diseases. 

What all this means is far more seniors would be able to live on their own without round the clock care and our aging population won't be a burden. 

It is certainly much better than all the problems that nonstop population growth causes.No, We Don't Need Endless Population Growth"

0,"Now I know the answer to this seems like an obvious yes. An ecosystem needs a true top predator and just about everywhere East of the Mississippi is lacking one, so it would seem logical to put wolves back in rather than just wait for the ones out West to expand. Especially when the ones that were East historically where a different kind than the ones we put out West but that's a less important issue.

However, I feel like we could do nothing and still get the role filled, which would allow us to focus our efforts elsewhere.

Coyotes have expanded far eastward thanks to humans wiping out the wolves that used to limit them. A coyote, even in their loose packs, would not be big enough to be a predator to the deer of the area (something necessary for a top predator to do here).

Because the niche is unfilled though, and because coyotes are so genetically close to wolves already, I would assume that they will naturally evolve to become big enough. The reward for even transitioning would be access to deer that are not quite as sick, young or old and the end reward is uncontested access to the deer population.

Speeding up this process is hybridization. An average coyote is only about 30 pounds, but when crossed with a wolf it adds 10 pounds to its average. Crossing with a dog can lead to varying results because of how diverse dogs are. It can lead to even smaller children or to much larger ones.

And in both hybridizations it was noted that the offspring become better at cooperation than a regular coyote.

With larger hybrids likely getting mates more easily due to their size and having a better mortality rate due to a firmer pack structure they can effectively boost the process of evolution.

Will they evolve far enough into the role of top predator in time to hold off the wolves from the North and the West when they eventually try trickling back in? I don't know, but the important thing is that they fill the role in the time the wolves are not there.

If they succeed it would save us quite a bit of effort as there's nothing we would have to actively do.

So the question for us becomes whether or not we believe it to be possible. If we don't think it is then we go ahead with re-introduction efforts. If we do think it's possible we can cross that re-introduction effort off the list.Should we re-introduce wolves to Eastern America or let the coyotes handle it?"
0,"It's just something I typed up that I thought would cover most of our problems. Rate it if you please. (It's translated from another language.)

We need a price on carbon dioxide emissions, progressively increasing by 5% each year. The cement and the steel mill industry? Shut down until they come up with greenhouse gas-free alternatives, which they ""promise"" they'll have ""within 5 years, tops!"". Force everyone to abandon letters for bills, and every other reason for letters for that matter. SMS and other digital options work just as well, if not better. Everyone knows that it is only old men/women who want to keep their letters. Force the delivery companies that operate within cities (not long haul, at least initially) to go electric. The tech is there, just subsidise them if they literally can't afford to make the cross.

Growth economy? Eh. The options are out there, known, and hardly that advanced. In fact, we only accept today's growth economy because it ""kind of worked so far,"" even though it literally hasn't. A cross *will* be hard to get, but ""only"" politically. Practically there's really no issues with experimenting and seeing what sticks.

Phase out flights almost completely. 15% extra flight tax every other year until 5% of flights remain. 95% of the aircraft that are taking off today do so unnecessarily and they're literally mostly holidays and business trips, as well as ""express shipping"" that can be solved in other ways. Fairly sure 5% is an exaggeration as well.

What remains are the cars, our consumption and the meat. Cow meat can be cut 50% without any real problems. Then we'll eat like in the 80s, and ""everything was terrible then"". Subsidise vegetarian alternatives and take the money directly from the meat industry until you reach a level that's sustainable.

Cars are a more difficult problem, but getting rid of the massive amount of short distance trips should be doable. A petrol tax for those living in cities maybe? Maybe just tax based on where you live, instead of taxing petrol directly, as that would make people outside the cities suffer. Then the countryside is being spared, but they should definitely have a higher gasoline prices compared to today anyway, since gas prices are not (yet) a significant portion of people's wages. In the end, we have a virtually fossil-free society where 80% of the short trips are done using lighter vehicles, without a passenger compartment (non-cars). Many buses. Many light electric vehicles (of which there are many). Car traffic has now gone down as a result, and roads that today take up huge areas of our cities can be converted to ""non-stop"" bicycle highways, which work great in Denmark and the Netherlands. ""There are no buses where I live!"" is solved by making it so that there is a bus where you live (you whiner).

Consumption, however, is the most difficult, but it can be done. The goal is to reduce consumption and increase local production. Products from abroad will be automatically ""taxed"" with the carbon dioxide tax, but there are many variables here (in terms of CO2 emissions per product), and a society should always prioritize what's actually necessary. Clothes? Not so badly necessary to have at our consumption levels (high), because it is a CO2 intensive product. Furniture? Hard question, but maybe have an extra tax on furniture that is considered to low-quality in some way? Exactly how to implement this I can't tell straight away, but furniture needs to be of high quality (lasts long) for a sustainable society. The same can be said about small gadgets and electronic gadgets, which we all love. A 5 year ""right to return"" warranty issued by the government should do the trick. If it breaks within that period and you can prove the manufacturer is at fault, you're legally entitled to a replacement of similar quality, or your money back.Rate my transformation plan (lol)"

But helium and hydrogen can bond as a liquid at the right temperature.

Surrounding the exosphere the last part of the atmosphere before space, we have molecules of hydrogen and helium and oxygen.

Hydrogen liquifies at -254°c 

Helium liquifies at -269.4°c

Temp of Space -270°c

So if hydrogen is liquid a bubble of helium could enter it and float it up to where Helium becomes liquid and the Oxygen molecules all together set off cold FUSION at -269°c 

At which point 2HYDROGEN AND 2OXYGEN fusion bond by the force of helium exit. Turning into a LIQUID.... RAIN! And it falls back down with the gravity of earth.

Helium is expelled naturally by decay of radioactive materials. It is stuck in the soil. 

Which is why we just had a major earthquake in puerto rico 5 days ago and now we are have major weather events coast to coast in USA. 

I bet if the tracked earthquakes they'd find the same pattern in RAIN

I think we need to TURN THE SOIL maybe 20ft down the location of the usual water table, where theres some moisture. That is where helium can be released. 

Check for weather events NW, after earthquakes to confirm!!!!

In perspective: That’s more than the total combined annual emissions of the 116 lowest-emitting countries. It also adds up to about three-quarters of Australia’s otherwise flattening greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019. Although it isn’t an unprecedented amount at this point of the year in Australia, emissions are way beyond typical levels in New South Wales, where this year’s fires are concentrated.

A vicious feedback loop: Rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall dries out trees, plants, and soil, amplifying fires when they break out. In turn, these huge fires are fueling climate change. [Read the full story](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615035/australias-fires-have-pumped-out-more-emissions-than-100-nations-combined/).

On this day, Eighty-one years ago (13th Jan 1939) with temperatures above 110°F (45°C) across Victoria and the state in drought, bushfires consumed 3,700 buildings across the state, 71 lives were lost and 5 towns completely destroyed- never to be rebuilt.

The Royal Commission into ‘’Black Friday’’ concluded;

“There had been no fires to equal these in destructiveness or intensity in the history of settlement in this State, except perhaps the fires of 1851, which, too, came at summer culmination of a long drought.

‘’At midday, in many places, it was dark as night. Men carrying hurricane lamps, worked to make safe their families and belongings Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees, and perished. Throughout the land there was daytime darkness’.’

“The speed of the fires was appalling. They leaped from mountain peak to mountain peak, or far out into the lower country, lighting the forests 6 or 7 miles in advance of the main fires. Blown by a wind of great force, they roared as they travelled. Balls of crackling fire sped at a great pace in advance of the fires, consuming with a roaring, explosive noise, all that they touched.‘’

‘’On that day it appeared that the whole State was alight.”

NB : Every child in every Australian school should be taught about the events of ‘Black Friday’ 1939 to give them an understanding and appreciation of the extreme danger of the Australian bush.

However keeping them ignorant of Australia’s bushfire history makes it far easier to radicalise them and recruit them into the Climate Cult.

As Orwell noted;

“The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.”13th JANUARY, 81 YEARS AGO WAS KNOWN AS ‘BLACK FRIDAY’ - AUSTRALIA"

0," Please take your time to read this. First of all, I may just be a mere 14 year old but I would like to make some things clear here as the situation of our own planet is getting way too dire. And before you start shooting crap at me, do your research first as I've done mine.

 We, humans, have managed to hunt an estimated 700 species of animals to extinction and around a million are endangered at this very moment. Yet we have world leaders here who can't even acknowledge climate change is real, world leaders who don't give a damn about the ecosystem and people saying killing anything ""lesser"" than you is fine cause it's ""just an animal."" Then there're these unnecessary animal sacrifices just cause of ""culture,"" so basically murdering others is a part of being you guys? Aight okay. And people should stop cutting down trees or harming and killing animals just for money, honestly.

 Let me tell y'all something. Put yourselves in the place of those animals. Imagine you're sitting there minding your own business and then some asshole comes over, destroys your home and kills you just for your fur or sth. Sure eating is fine cause food chain but seriously, doesn't it concern any of you that we could be doing it in excess? And the least you can do is make their death painless. Bro, we're literally in the sixth mass extinction right now. Search it up.

 And this WWIII topic shouldn't even be a thing rn like wtf is up with people only wanting to fill money in their pockets (the government)? Y'all don't give a fuck, do you? That your people have to suffer in your stead cause of how stupid you were? And you could be focusing on better things like THE FCKIN PLANET DYING BECAUSE OF Y'ALL but noooo. You don't care cause you got money. Lmao bruh like you wouldn't even be where you are now if the environment was SHIT.

 Like your fucking children are going to be living in a fucking dystopian world and they're gonna think, ""Why didn't we do anything sooner?"" THERE IS A LACK OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS RIGHT NOW CAUSE YOU PEOPLE DON'T CARE. NONE OF WHAT WE SAY MATTERS BECAUSE ""we're just normal people."" Tf are the authorities doing? Like how tf did you all even become leaders? We have so many fucking ignorant and selfish retards in this world and YOU ALL SHOULD FRICKIN START CARING CAUSE THIS IS OUR FUCKING PLANET AND YOU'RE THE ONES KILLING IT.

 This isn't progress. Because all we've done so far was manage to wipe out other organisms and destroy nature's wildlife, what the planet gave us. We've been failing not just individually but as a race altogether. We should all step up and start actually fucking trying. Just a few conservation groups like Greenpeace can't do everything themselves. Instead of depending only on THEM, WE OURSELVES, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO DO IT ALONE, SHOULD BE TRYING. We learn all these things at school about plastic and shit but do most of you care? Nope.

 Guys, please, Imma be frank here, if we're not the ones to do this, who are? We should start incorporating the Three R's into our daily routine and taking part in all conservation efforts as much as we can NOW instead of regretting it later when the weather patterns start becoming too frickin erratic. 

 Don't go all, ""I'm just trying my hardest to live my own life,"" cause you wouldn't have one if your environment was utter shit as in only flames and burning everywhere. This is YOUR PROBLEM TOO because this is YOUR PLANET. WE'RE ALL LIVING ON IT. GLOBAL WARMING AND ALL THIS, IT'S OUR PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE TOGETHER. Some day... our planet will actually be nothing but a charred black ball, if we don't do anything now. Some of us are actually begging you here. Help us.Idk if this is the right place but pls share this everywhere cause we need more awareness and actual efforts here."
0,"In order for adverts to be displayed on any device, they have to be created. This requires energy, so its a waste.

Advert files have to be stored somewhere, so normally they are stored on a server - or many servers. The making of a server includes the use of more energy, materials that can be damaging to the environment and potentially non-recyclable. 

Now that they are created and stored, they need to be distributed. This makes everybody's' networks slower as they only have a limited bandwidth - an allowance of speed and data transmission per network. Each packet of the advert is using up bandwidth, especially the new trend of video ads. For those on a meted network, it starts to cost money. Particular with mobile and devices that rely on battery, the battery drains faster but its overall lifespan is significantly reduced, meaning that new batteries have to be put in, the old batteries go and damage the environment with their toxic chemicals, while the production of the new batteries causes more damage. Now lets talk CPU, the Central Processing Unit converts the bits of data and displays them, communicating with graphics processor and speakers along the way, which also incur damage through overuse. If a CPU has too much load then it can overheat and get damaged very quickly, again requiring replacement similar to the batteries. As if that is not enough, lots of people might not replace components of a device as sometimes it is more expensive than just buying a new device, so old devices get put in landfill or silicone valley.Mobile adverts damage the environment"

So knowing that... lets play Follow the Bubble:


1. Helium Bubbles through fertile soil traveling with just a smidge of water vapor and it rises fast. 


2. If enough helium bubbles were releases. They would contact Liquid Nitrogen and could bubble IN but instead of flying through they would act like a parachute or hot air balloon and LIFT the heavy gravity bound Nitrogen.


3. Nitrogen shoots up like a filled balloon in the atmosphere.


4. Nitrogen freezes at a certain temperature. With the helium inside.


5. Nitrogen has only a thin barrier to obscure Solar Radiation before it is a... magnifying glass.


I theorize:

That If a child can burn a tree with a simple magnifying glass in moments, on the ground.


Then: 


The potential to amplify solar radiation through frozen nitrogen at an exponentially closer place to the sun is that.. FOLD. many many many times over.


It is without a doubt possible that a Fusion reaction could take place.

IF a fusion reaction were to take place that high up? It would be ABOVE the clouds. There is little to NO Oxygen.

AND if there is no oxygen, there can be no flame. But.. there can always be a burn. This leads me to SPRITES.


SPRITES: 

Sprites have No known Purpose.

I had never heard of a SPRITE before my research. But a Sprite is lightning ABOVE the clouds. It is regarded as a phenomena, but NOT a process. 


I do not believe the earth would have that large of a phenomena. Without a functional process. 


I theorize this is the FUSION REACTION.

There is No Flame, because there is No Oxygen. But this could be a BURN, a burn without a flame.


By my estimation, and multiple articles on helium bubbles what I have described above IS the process. RAIN! HELIUM is the CARRIER for NITROGEN to Freeze, Radiate and Fusion/Sprite together molecules for OZONE and FRESH WATER."

MEGA Day 1: One day a week, use no fossil fuel: only mass transport, or bicycle or walk. (No carpooling or ""riding with a friend"" allowed!). Unless really cold, no gas-heating at home either.

Why? Saving fossil fuel one day a week is a 14% reduction. That's a good start.

MEGA Day 2: Once day a week, do not **create** any throw-away. No recycling, no garbage, etc.  Use personal mug in coffee shops. If ordering take-out, only buy from restaurants that either allow me to bring my own containers or provide compostable ones.

Why? Food and beverage containers and packaging are a huge portion of the waste that ends up in landfills and oceans.MEGA - Make Earth Green Again!"

0,"I'm from Sydney and I thought that I'd share how my experience with the bushfires has went so that those outside of Australia (or even those outside of the bushfire areas but still in Australia, say Perth for example) will know what it feels like. (If not bothered reading scroll down to TL;DR).

Now, I live in the city and have thankfully not had any property destroyed, neither has my relatives. However the bushfires have affected my health. I am borderline asthmatic and I cough when I forget to have my enhaler every day and night. Now you might think that the effects will be small, but trust me, they're not.

When the bushfires kept on coming very prominently (around late November early December) I kept on coughing my lungs out, even indoors. Whenever I went outside (which I had to in order to go to the doctors for several certificates for school), I would always have to cover my mouth and when I forgot to my coughing was bad. Once it even felt like something in my chest was wrong, like it was changing or something, but thankfully I got in the car so nothing bad happened.

And outside it was bad, as you know there was a huge smog outside like it was China or something. But some of you might not know that there was ash FALLING FROM THE SKY, like RAIN DROPS but ASH. This was made even worse by the fact that it doesn't rain often in Australia (even in winter), because I remember when I was little it would rain once every week, occasionally every two weeks but now we always have to wait a few weeks, like 3 for rain (at least where I live). So, the ash kept on falling for a while until rain finally came to save us all.

And because of the smog and ash and my asthma issues I wasn't able to go to school a lot at the end of the year, and kept on getting picked up early when my parents did (because 9 times out of 10 the smog seemed to clear up, only for another bushfire to occur). Because of this, at the end of the year I was called in to discuss my attendance with a bunch of others (I know quite a few people who turned up even less then I did at the end of the year), and although they said it was because of my attendance on Thursdays where sport is held, I personally find that bullshit because I know I've shown up often for Thursdays until the end of the year, so I know what that meeting really was about.

And now I find out that in Sydney at least, the smog is getting into our tap water so we can't drink it. We can still use it for hygiene purposes apparently (even though I find that bullshit), but because we can't drink it we have to rely on fridge water from old tap water from a few months ago, and when that runs out bottled water. And I'm against bottled water too which makes this worse!

The worse part is that idiots like my parents are STILL defending Scomo for some reason, saying that ""it's not because of climate change"" and that ""he's doing the best he can"". I get that some fires started because of stupid idiots either lighting them on purpose (some kids mind you) or people not following fire bans, but this all happened due to climate change that Australia contributed to. In fact, my parents rely on coal. And because not only am I a minor who lives with them, but I'm financially dependent on them too, I'm stuck with coal as well. I wish I could use renewables and one day afford a Telsa :(

So the bushfires have affected everyone, not just those who have lost their homes, although I wish them good luck and I wish I had the money to donate to the RFS. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!

TL;DR: Although I haven't lost my home I have borderline asthma and the bushfires affected my health BAD. It affected me so much that I wasn't able to go to school, and the bushfires had such an effect on our environment that ash kept on falling from the sky until it eventually rained. Smog has also gotten into our tap water now and we are unable to drink it, yet for some reason some people wanna defend ScoMo and his fossil fuel love affair.How The Australian Bushfires Has Affected Me"

0,"If you were born before the year 2000 you may remember a time without Smartphone. Now this won't be a thread about the good old times, but a fair amount of criticism of modern times is always necessary, without nostalgia. Smartphones, Social Media and Influencer have changed our world in the blink of an eye. Trump posts an USA flag after killing the General and the Iran responds with a Twitter post of a flag of Iran, after shooting themselves. Social Media is without a doubt an important piece of Information and communication in our time.

And, just like newspapers, books, magazines or even mobile phones, the Internet is a source of Propaganda. What is Propaganda? I think the best defintion is: Propaganda is the act of spreading lies or information, which are only half true, with the goal of achieving an Agenda. Joseph Goebells didn't tell the people they were aryans, because he wanted to share his knowledge, but because he wanted to gain power. People go to the Internet, because their President writes on Twitter. Nothing special. But the problem of the Internet is that not only people can access data, but share data as well. In the past president Roosevelt said *Apples are green*. You either believed him or not. Maybe you looked at another source and suddenly found this statement: *Apples are red*. You consider that Roosevelt has already lied once and so believe that Apples are red. In reality this is far more complex and most people either didn't read a second source at all or many more than just a second one.  
But in the age of the Internet people don't have just a few different sources, but hundred-thousands. If an article has 256 comments, youll have 256 different opinions. Who do you believe, if the author claims x, but the comments say y?   
It all boils down to simple human concepts: the mass is always right. If you have 5 friends and 1 says the moon is a sphere and the others say it's made out of cheese, then it's made out of cheese. Because the mass is always right. We see this behaviour in the political parties, we see this behaviour in environmentalism with the argument of ""97% scientists say"" and we see this behaviour in our daily life. But it's wrong. The human mind is oversaturated with opinions and starts using his instincts and believes what the masses say - and the masses are controlled by bots and paid actors. 

Even worse: Influencer are bad for the society. So why where people in the past Heroes? Why did people liked Michael Jordan or Will Smith? Aerosmith or ACDC? Because they were prominent and because of their actions. They had to be good actors or musicians, comedians or  politicans to be famous. And because they were famous, they made money. Nowadays however it's enough to generate clicks to make money. A company doesn't matter how you generate clicks, as long as they can reach the highest amount of audience and make profit. You could kill Koalas in front of a camera and if your videos make billions of views, people will praise you for your fame and will give you money. Someone like PewDiePie isn't a good role model. He doesn't tell people to get educated, but shows them that using insults is fine, if you are rich. 

Most (not all of course) Influencers are stupid, uneducated and have no morale. They are rich, because they are famous, they are famous, because they have viewers and they have viewers because they are rich. This hurts society and should not be underestimated. I'd like to link the mass depression of these times to this: people see that bad people make a lot of money by holding a product in the camera. They criticize this and get insulted by their blind fanbase and they get depressed. Then they spread their opinion on social media themselves and drag down other people too. In the end no one cares for Australia, Iran or Amazonas anymore, because everyone is on suicide watch. As long as someone can make money by being stupid, saying insults or making low-effort videos, this Society is screwed. We as society praise people who hurt this society, instead of praising those who try to save the planet. 

This sub has only 641k members. That's incredible low. Posts here usually have around 140-300 comments, while the latest articles about the Iran go up to several thousands comments (around 3,2k). Why is that so? Because the Internet feeds us with articles - TV and Social Media news only know one topic now: war. They want you to talk about war, so you click their articles. If they would make diverse articles about all problems in this world (plastic in the ocens, nuclear waste, Koalas dying) their clicks would be lower than if they simply make the same amount of articles about a possible war. 

Media and Internet is responsible for this. Without a doubt. Large companies (oil, gas, coal) advocate against Climate Change actions. It's a proven fact that parties use bots and paid users to influence social media in election times - So why shouldn't people with even more moeny don't do that? Even more: In many countries the amount of donations for parties has declined - This shows, that companies are no longer interested in influencing politics to make profit, but they simply donate money to influencers, bots, trolls or users to advocate in their sense. 

People are then confused: I say Climate Change real, others say not. Who is right? Because of Propaganda for Profits, 10,000 people write 10,000 different opinions and the 10,001 user doesn't know anymore what is correct. They start following their instincts and go back to tribalism: the mass is right. Our group is right and the others lie. Facts, I am talking about Scientifical Researches, become a lie and alternative facts are repeated so often, that people start believing them (this concept comes from Joseph Goebells). 

&amp;#x200B;

Many people, which are Climate Change deniers, wonder why people talk about Socialism. The answer is: Climate Change isn't a single problem. It's not a broken wheel that you can exchange and drive further. It's a systematical problem. It start where you can't buy a bread or a bottle of watter without hurting this planet, because the producer moved the production to India to lower costs, and it continues to the massive amount of manipulation that happens in the Internet. Many people are hesistant to admit it, but if we want to save this planet, we need restrictions in our economy, and if we want to save humanity, we need restrictions in the Internet.How the Internet is a cause for Climate Change"

0,"After taking a look at myself and my family during Christmas, I felt really upset about the efforts I failed to put towards properly seperate all of my recyclables and waste. I wanted to show my children that humans make mistakes, but once we know better, it's our responsibility to do better. I immediately found an app for my location that let's me see where the nearest recycling drop off locations are for a variety of waste ranging from bulbs, batteries, Styrofoam, plastic bags, etc. I have a small system prepped to seperate all these items and then I've committed to delivering these bins once they are full of recyclables. Additionally, I looked into finding a way to buy snacks and food from wholesale stores where I can store them in reusable containers rather than buy them in individual wrappers. Essentially, I am making a concerted effort to reduce the waste my family makes and our effect on the world.

Cut to Sunday night... Me and the wife notice a new documentary series on Netflix and decide to watch the episode discussing recycling and the impact on the world. It was incredibly eye opening and depressing. I was sad to learn that most of the plastic we seperate for recycling cannot be recycled and will end up being purchased in bulk for the small portions thst can be reused, while the rest will be left in a landfill, get blown into the ocean, and or be burned, releasing more toxic gas into the atmosphere.

Does anyone else feel this way about the current state of the world? Why are we so powerless to change these things when we have discovered new and more eco friendly / sustainable ways to continue living our lives? Is the cost to each person really the issue? Or are we actually incapable of holding the industries accountable to the world?

I do not agree with Climate Alarmists and politicians who are trying to get your votes from fear.

All I hear is that we are the problem with this crisis, and all of  you have to vote for me because I will declare an emergency when I am elected. Eliminate all gas or diesel vehicles NOW. Cut the subsidies to force the politicians to fix the problem. **Renewable's NOW!**

It seems that ½ of this country has completely lost their minds!  

No one has done the math. 

Let me show you. Today is 1/8/2020  Just for Giggles and Grins, lets say magically all cars, trucks and gas engine vehicles were electric today.  

This is a 30,000 foot view of the situation, and this discussion is only for today, because 10 / 20 / 50 ++ years from now we will need much more because we will grow in population, homes, businesses, and vehicles.  

Currently there about are 273 Million ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) powered vehicles.  [Number of cars in U.S. | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183505/number-of-vehicles-in-the-united-states-since-1990/)  They all need to be charged to operate. On average, lets assume that they all have the same capacity as a new Tesla, 100KWh, that their batteries store enough energy to drive 400 miles. Now I know all of you will say this or that, that the we do not need to charge from nothing, that there is something left in the battery.  

I agree.  I try to fill up my car with gas on average when the car is between empty and ½ full. Lets say on average we Americans fill our tanks when there is 1/3 left.  So if we extend this thinking, then all cars will need to be “fueled” with electricity when they still have 1/3 energy still left.  At 100,000 Watt Hours, they will need, lets call it 67,000 Watt Hours of energy.  On average Americans fill up their tanks ONCE A month per Google.  So each month, 273 million cars will need 67,000 Watt Hours of energy. 

About 18.3 TRILLION Watt Hours of energy will be needed from the grid, per month.  Total USA production of electricity is 4.17 Quadrillion Watt Hours PER YEAR!  [What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3)  So we need 12 months x 18.3 Trillion Watt Hours = 219.5 Trillion Watt Hours,  just for our cars / trucks etc, on top of the 4.17 Quadrillion Watt Hours that runs our country.  A total of 4.4 Quadrillion Watt Hours need to be produced EACH YEAR.  A 6% increase to produce 219.5 Trillion Watt Hours for our cars and trucks (lets round that to 220)! Doesn't sound that much does it?  

But lets peel the onion further..........................................................  

USA has 98 operational Nuclear Reactors that generated 807 Trillion Watt Hours a year.  [Nuclear Power in the USA](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-power.aspx)  So we would need another 27 more Nuclear power plants **just to power the vehicles.**  Obviously that won't work, since we have stopped all Nuclear Power Plant construct except one in Georgia, that will be done for next year. There are just 7 new ones proposed, and they don't look too good.  

**OK, lets look at Solar**  We need 220 Trillion Watt Hours for EV's. Lets look at one of the highest output solar farm  [Desert Sunlight Solar Farm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Sunlight_Solar_Farm)  Desert Sunlight 300, LLC produced 703 Billion Watt Hours in 2017. So we would need another 313 OF THESE solar farms JUST FOR vehicles. 

But there are a few problems.  “*In 2012 the National Parks Conservation Association issued a report identifying three desert solar power plants sited within five miles of National Parks in the California Desert as projects that* ***they suggest it should not have been approved in their locations, including the Desert Sunlight Solar Farm****. The group cites damage to visual resources, and impacts on desert species “*  

The next question is, where can they go now that there is a backlash that these “Farms” have wrecked havoc with the local environment?  Also remember. **They don't work at night or in snow (Solar Farms in ALASKA? Come on!)**

They are not that great in lots of rain (but the rain does clean them off, cools them and that promotes efficiency) 

**OK, Wind, how about that?**  As of 2019, there was 67 Terra Watt Hours installed annually that supply the basic grid. So we will need about **4 times more just for vehicles.**  Yep it can be done, just remember that while we have the area to do that, primarily from Texas up the central USA which has the best land available with wind. We will need massive upgrades in the grid to move that across the country.  **Wind is variable especially at night** when the turbines MUST have at least 8 – 12 MPH of constant wind just to keep turning, and if they stop, they need 15 MPH constant wind to start turning again. Google it.  

The problem is the availability **WHERE** it is needed **WHEN** it is needed! There is a lot of complex issues that would have to be addressed. As I said, I am looking at the BIG 30,000 foot picture.  

I already know there will be magnitudes improvements in storage (I hesitate to use the word battery, because of the 75 minute charge cycle for a car (Tesla) or worse for a truck. In the long view, it will never work until we can recharge our cars in 15 minutes.  So gas engines for vehicles will be around for a LONG LONG time. We WILL have a lot more solar and wind. But 24/7, obviously not!  Some people think we can have storage batteries, but come on!  You would need to turn New Jersey into a battery just to run New York City!  

We will be able to go 100% electric transportation when we have deployed 100's of FUSION reactors (they are coming in the next decade, but different discussion), and upgraded our grid and developed a new storage system for vehicles that can be recharged in 15 minutes as I said.

I am going out on a limb and say, 150 - 200 years?  Like I said, this is my 30,000 foot view of the issue.

**Title: Why does anybody still believe we can stop climate change?:**

We have known climate change was an  existential threat to industrialised civilisation for over 30 years now.  It has become apparent in recent years that the threat had been  underestimated. And yet greenhouse emissions are still rising, the  population is still rising, and we have made no progress whatsoever in  making systemic changes. For example, though the UK government has  accepted climate change is a serious threat to civilisation and must be  stopped, it nevertheless decided, after very lengthy deliberations, that  it is necessary to expand Heathrow Airport. The reason is that if this  doesn't happen, the Dutch will expand their capacity and threaten  Heathrow's position as the most important aviation hub in Europe. This  is madness. Unfortunately, it is also reality.

We  are not going to stop climate change. Even if we did everything humanly  possible to stop it, there's probably 3 to 4 degrees “baked into the  cake”. And the politics says we won't do everything possible. This isn't  about ""should"" or ""shouldn't"". It's about ""won't"".

This  is about global co-operation, or the impossibility of it. We have no  hope of even getting one major sovereign state to agree internally to  the sort of sacrifices needed (banning cheap air travel, limiting  population growth, etc....). But to actually stop the eco-catastrophe,  we'd have to get all the major sovereign states to agree between them to  make those sacrifices. This is pure fantasy. It can't happen in the  real world. On the contrary – in the difficult times to come, what is  actually going to take place is a desperate fight for survival, at all  sorts of levels. If the human race couldn't get together to sort out its  differences during the “good times” (ecologically), how can we  seriously expect it to do so when there's a collapse coming?

There  are some things humans simply can't fix. Things like poverty, war, or  widespread mental illness and substance abuse. We can help in specific  cases , but we can't eliminate the general problem. It's like this with  climate change and the wider environmental problem. We can reduce  emissions in some manner, in some places. We eradicated CFCs. But the  only thing that's going to stop industrialised civilisation in general  from emitting greenhouse gases and generally screwing up the ecosystem  is industrialised civilisation stopping. Or at least getting a lot  smaller.

If this is true – if we  really can't stop climate change – then what is the point in continuing  to pretend we can? What do we have to lose, in the long run, by  proclaiming publicly that we believe it is already too late?

If  this is true, then sooner or later this is going to be widely  understood, and our public discourse and politics will have to change to  reflect it. This may be extremely uncomfortable, but surely if it is  unavoidable, there is no benefit in delaying the point where it is  widely understood.Yes, Climate Change really is an appropriate subject for r/environmentalism."

This idea was incepted by Mr Beast’s subscribers over various social media platforms as a celebration for reaching the major milestone of 20 million subscribers. Mr Beast accepted the challenge and teamed up with Mark Rober to start the #teamtrees project. 

This ambitious endeavour has necessitated the largest YouTube collaboration in history; notable mentions including: Smarter every day, Linus tech tips, slow mo guys, iJustine, Marques brownlee, Alan becker, Jeffree Star and many more. With only 2 months to complete the challenge the team and many other content creators published tons of content to promote the movement, which has since gained huge traction, amassing 14 million dollars in the first 14 days.

One of the largest donations of $1,000,000 was made on the 4th day of the campaign, from Elon Musk of Tesla and Space X. This was followed up the next day by a $1,000,001 donation from Tobias Lütke CEO of Shopify, who was not about to be out done by Elon \[1\]. Of course many other celebrity figures also donated.

Obviously these are a scratch on the bank balance of some of these donors; but it is great to see such a positive contribution from many key influencers, as the message from #teamtrees is arguably much more significant than the trees themselves. But let's look into this in more detail. What is the social and environmental impact of #teamtrees?

It is estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half, since the start of human civilisation \[2\]. Deforestation increases carbon-dioxide levels as there are less trees to absorb CO2 and when the products made from trees get burned or disposed of they release their carbon back to the environment. but planting them could store away some of the carbon we’ve put in the atmosphere.

The teamtrees project has partnered with Arbor Day Foundation, a non-government-organisation that has been planting trees in North America and around the world for the last 47 years. In fact they are the oldest tree planting NGO who focus on planting and maintaining native species in public forest-lands managed by government agencies; so as to not disrupt local biodiversity. Their motto is “to plant the right trees, in the right place, at the right time, for the right reasons.” 

This is in contrast to other recent tree planting efforts, who although virtuous in intention, may be harming local wildlife. This is due to planting primarily mono-culture plantations of trees, but more on that in a minute. 

Globally there has never been more ambition and action in planting trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square km of forest by 2030, this is almost as big an area as the entire European Union \[3\]. The target, superficially at least, looks likely to be achieved. However, “tree planting is not always good” according to Simon Lewis, Global change science UCL. This is because the motives for planting trees are not always green. Remember the mono-culture plantations we mentioned earlier? They are large tree planting efforts where thousands of hectares is planted with a single species of tree. Currently half of the government tree planting pledges involve short rotation, monoculture plantations \[2\].

Short rotation means that they are planting trees with polluting fertiliser to speed up growth so they can be harvested for greater commercial value.  The most common trees planted in tree planting projects are eucalyptus, oil palm and pine; which produce very lucrative raw materials, most of which is exported to developed countries, leaving behind the true value of the resource: ecological degradation, depleted soil, pesticide contaminated water,  and an exploited native population. Monoculture plantations of these trees suffocate biodiversity. In addition, evergreen species like eucalyptus take up ground water all year round leading to dry earth and increased risk of forest fires \[4\]. For instance, in January in Chile in 2017, 600,000 hectares of tree plantations, native forests and other lands went up into flames as a result of prolonged periods of drought in the widespread monoculture pine plantations. Causing 11 fatalities and massive social and economic harm, the Chilean fires provided further evidence that monoculture tree plantations undermine a regions climate resilience. They are highly susceptible to fire, pests, and storm damage. They also erode the soils, suppress plant and animal biodiversity, and deplete and contaminate water resources. When they cut down for resource value, the exposure of lose depleted soil promotes desertification and increases the risks of landslides \[4\]. Hence, studies show that harvested plantations only store 1/40th of the carbon natural forests do. However, making and disposing of products made from harvested trees is simply returning that small amount of carbon saved back into the atmosphere. \[2\]

This takes us to the point that plantations are not forests, and not all trees planting efforts are beneficial to the environment; sadly many of them are harmful but win government and public funding, largely due to the growing support of climate policies which can be deceitful satisfied on paper through monoculture plantations whilst profiting from the resources harvested. If you’d like more details please see the videos by the economist and ecosia linked in the description.  

The world is currently in love with the idea of planting trees. However, as noble as the notion is we must be truthful about what our impacts really are otherwise we will not see any real changes. An article published in “Science” last July estimated the total global tree cover potential \[5a\]. The results show there is space for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of forest cover, which if allowed to mature could store an optimistic 205 Gton of carbon. This computational result assumed large areas of land which is not suitable for forest growth; and was corrected by a different study, to a more realistic 42 Gton of carbon \[5b\]. Of course this is still a significant amount of carbon. In fact it is enough to sequester all of the carbon emitted in 2010 \[6\]. Of course we are emitting more and more greenhouse gasses each year and there is only finite space to plant trees to remove these gases. Additionally, we still have to allow the forests to mature, which could take 3-4 decades. But this only emphasises the urgency to act. This is a prediction of the carbon dioxide emissions with associated temperature rise for the most aggressive climate response from the IPCC in their special report “Global Warming of 1.5°C”. Ultimately, “Ecological restoration, if carefully implemented, can have a role in mitigating climate change, it is no substitute for the fact that most fossil fuel emissions will need to stop to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement”.

If our current climate policy pledges are upheld, then by the year 2050 we can expect a 3.0 degree Celsius increase in average global temperature; which is considered insufficient by the ‘Climate Action Tracker’ \[7\]. This would cause the sea level to raise up to 0.3 m \[6\] damaging coastal city infrastructure as well as habitat loss for fish and coastal species. As rising sea level coincides with more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons, unpredictable natural disasters will become more frequent. Which are already starting to occur and cause migration away from disaster affected regions. In fact the first of 2019 alone saw the displacement of a record 7 million people due to natural disasters; nearly twice that of conflicts in the same period \[8\].

This is not to say that planting trees is a bad thing. Tree plantations are environmentally harmful, but regeneration of natural forests is an effective way to increase climate resilience and biodiversity, as well as reducing climate change through CO2 absorption. But planting forests is hard; and it doesn’t produce much economical profit. But it's one of the best ways we can combat climate change. So next time a tree planting effort asks for your support, ask them “are you planting mixed forests or monocultures?”. As far as we can tell the Arbor Day foundation are not planting commercial monoculture plantations, and some of their projects are mixed species forests.

International government intervention is the most effective way to combat climate, however, we have yet to see any significant global action from any government. Regardless, the most important takeaway from TeamTrees is that large government action is not the only way to tackle climate change. Is it possible within the public sphere through small donations from large numbers of individuals who care about the future, to sway public opinion, gather funds and make a real impact on the global climate.

Although the numerical impact of #teamtress is likely small,  this project is a powerful gesture supporting the climate change movement and raising awareness. This will undoubtedly sow the seeds for future large scale, public sector driven climate action. We would like to congratulate TeamTrees for achieving their goal, and for proving that the ability to regenerate our climate is within every individuals’ power. The challenge now for each of us is to maintain the momentum and keep searching for sustainable ways to clean up our environment.

 The governor of Kansas said on Thursday that she’d likely sign a bill to legalize marijuana in the state if lawmakers sent one to her desk.

In a pair of TV interviews looking at her legislative priorities for 2020, Gov. Laura Kelly (D) said the legislature needs to approve medical cannabis, which she argued would help families with children who have serious illnesses and also combat the opioid crisis.

But while the governor said she isn’t “going to advocate for” broader recreational legalization, that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t enact such legislation if it advanced in the state.

“I haven’t really decided what I would do. This is something where what the people want is probably more what I will want on something like that,” Kelly told WIBW. “I don’t have a personal ideology regarding it. If the folks want it and the legislature passes it, would I sign it? Probably.”

 

The governor of Kansas said on Thursday that she’d likely sign a bill to legalize marijuana in the state if lawmakers sent one to her desk.

But while the governor said she isn’t “going to advocate for” broader recreational legalization, that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t enact such legislation if it advanced in the state.

“I haven’t really decided what I would do. This is something where what the people want is probably more what I will want on something like that,” Kelly told WIBW. “I don’t have a personal ideology regarding it. If the folks want it and the legislature passes it, would I sign it? Probably.”

**Watch Kelly’s comments on marijuana legalization below:**

Again, however, she stressed that it’s the more focused legalization of cannabis for medical purposes that is part of her personal agenda for the 2020 session.

“I have always said that I want it well-regulated so that it’s controlled so that it’s not the first step to legalization of marijuana,” the governor [said](https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Medicaid-marijuana-top-Kansas-governors-2020-priorities-566665261.html). “I don’t want that. I want it to be seen as a pharmaceutical and controlled as we do that.”

“I do believe that medical marijuana needs to be legalized,” she added. “It does have medical uses, and I think it would do a lot for our families who have these kids with Dravet syndrome, which is that severe, frequent epileptic seizures, and I also think that it would help with the opioid crisis.”

Kelly has repeatedly been on the record voicing support for medical marijuana, including as part of her [election campaign in 2018](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-in-the-governors-mansion-record-number-of-candidates-say-legalize-it/), but her concession that she’d sign off on adult-use legalization is notable. And while she said that doesn’t “think Kansas is ready to go there” with the more far-reaching policy change, a recent poll indicates that most state residents are in fact ready.

The annual Kansas Speaks survey, released last month, showed that [63 percent of Kansans are in favor of adult-use marijuana legalization](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/legalizing-marijuana-has-majority-support-in-kansas-poll-finds/). [https://globalmarijuanadispensary.com/shop/kush-mints/](https://globalmarijuanadispensary.com/shop/kush-mints/) 

With that, it appears the only thing that remains to be seen is whether the legislature will pass a legalization bill and send it to Kelly’s desk.

For now, however, the prospects look good for at least enacting some form of medical cannabis legalization in the state. A special legislative commission issued [recommendations](https://www.kcur.org/post/no-smoking-kansas-medical-marijuana-push-aims-edibles-and-topicals#stream/0) last year in support of establishing a limited medical marijuana program that would allow patients to access products that can’t be smoked or vaped. It also said patients visiting from out of state should be afforded some legal protections.

“I’m fully aware of the desire that people have for the legalization of medical marijuana,” Kelly [said](https://www.ksnt.com/capitol-bureau/governor-kelly-prepares-for-2020-legislative-session/) in a separate interview with KSNT. “I support it and I hope the legislature deals with it.”Trump: New sanctions on Iran but U.S. ""ready to embrace peace"""

0,"I was having a debate with someone about climate change and they started going oh it's all a hoax the usual. After some.more conversation they trot out the usual lines of we don't know about temperatures more than 150 years, measurement of co2 is not accurate. Then they trotted out the Dr Tim ball stuff where he implies that water vapour is the most prominent green house gas at over 90% and man made co2 is only a tiny fraction of the remaining 5% of green house gases that is co2.

It is hard to argue these kinds of things and make me question my self over the reality of the issue. 

Could someone point to definitive reading that disproves these claims and helps me gain a correct understanding of anthropogenic impact.

One of them is the co2 ppm over time which puts at odds the Tim ball claim. It's never been above 400 ppm in the last million years. Meaning total co2 in the atmosphere has to have a much larger anthropogenic contribution?

0,"Basically the title. I'm a former political science turned computer science major at UW Madison. While I was a political science major I was interested in pursuing an environmental law degree after my undergraduate studies. Even though I have switched to a computer science degree, my passion for conservation and protecting the environment has not changed, and I would like to apply my software development skills towards helping the environment.

One of the things that bothers me most about the computer science field is how people believe that it has little impact on social change. I, however, am part of an organization that focuses on connecting social change with computer science, by using software development to help areas of social change.

I am interested in addressing environmental issues particularly, and I was interested to see if anyone had any ideas for software that could be used for environmental research or other purposes to help the environment. Any ideas, no matter how rough or abstract, are greatly appreciated!People who work in the environmental science field, are there any phone or desktop apps that would help in your jobs?"

[Rebo-Smart-Bottle Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rebo-smart-bottle-clean-the-planet-as-you-drink#/)

Many things seem to be off about this startup and especially its business model:

* Why Smart bottles when the solution is simply to buy a stainless steel bottle for 20 bucks and donate the rest directly to a waste picking organization
* Picking up one bottle everytime a person drinks. I have so many issues with this. How much are they gonna donate per sip? Won't the number of sips times the price of a sip exceed their profits after a while? Or are they just hoping the sensors will stop working after a while. 
* They mentioned the blockchain, which screams: RED FLAG. Why use such an infrastructure when all they are doing is counting the number of times people are flipping bottles on their vertical axis and sending a sum of money that is proportional to that count to nonprofits 
* To top it, in the comments on Indiegogo, they said that they are planning to build an AI detection system to prevent 'fake drinking'. 

It's tragic in my opinion because they have managed to raise around 100k CHF from people who are probably very well intentioned and who have been led to believe that they contributed to some positive change in the world. This leads me to ask the following question: Shouldn't we be even more careful when it comes to supporting companies that advertise themselves as sustainable given that we are naturally inclined to be more receptive to their ideas?

[Snickerdoodles and Shortbreads by Morris Stuttard, Booked by Nabiel](https://discord.gg/dwPj3u3)

All the best for the new year, all.

SNICKERDOODLES &amp; SHORTBREADS

by Morris Stuttard. Story booked by [u/Nabiel](https://www.reddit.com/u/Nabiel/)

“Me? Christmas was more the stuff we did. Playing Nat King Cole while decoratin’ the tree. Helping Ma make snickerdoodles and shortbreads. Grandpops with the same joke on repeat—telling us to look at the baubles on the tree; said they were crystal balls and if ya looked into ‘em, you’d see how fat you’ll be once Christmas is gone done.

“And Pops would tell me it was my job to make mistletoe. The ingredients were the same every year: apple trees, a ladder, secateurs, and a boy still too young to fear death by fallin’.

“I never told him that each year I was more afraid to go up those trees than I was the last. By sixteen I was darn-near terrified. ‘Got some christmas spice this year, Tye—damn gale’s a blowing out there,’ Pops said before we went out.

“There weren’t no berries on the apple-tree mistletoe that year so Pops sent me up an oak—a tall straight one whose lowest branches were still four men high. I remember—the old tree weren’t swaying that day, the thing was flapping when I climbed it. And wi’ me way up there, clipping away in a fury at the sprigs of mistletoe like I were Denzel Scissorhands or some god damn... And the sprigs of mistletoe dropped down and went bouncing across the field in the wind, with pops chasing em down, shouting up that I’d done good, and all the while both my hands shaking more than grandpops’ cigarette during overtime in a Cowboys game. But I got the damn mistletoe.

“And we had white Christmases sometimes too—not like here—and we all went sledding down Truman Hill. Went so damn far and fast one time that I had to jump off before I hit the river. We spent the next half hour trying to fish the thing out of the water with them metal rods that poke out of concrete.”

“Rebars,” comes Luca’s twang from inside his tent, the glow of his phone screen floating supernaturally behind the blue nylon. “They’re called rebars to those that know.”

A silence lingers as Tye lets his thoughts wander more. He heaves out a clouded sigh. “Wonder if Ma and Pops think about the Christmases when they were kids, or the Christmases when we were.”

A silence more.

Until Tye finishes his thought. “Christmas is only fun when you’re a littl’un. Ain’t meant for grown ups. Not more than facilitatin’ anyways.”

None of the line of huddled men and women on the street say anything to disagree. But rarely do they say anything when it’s this cold. Conversation is for summer when you’re on the street.

There is movement at last from Tye’s right. Old Cody lifts his Santa hat from his eyes but doesn’t go as far as to open them. ""That’s the first time I heard you say a single nice thing about your pops.""

Tye spits so hard through his teeth that it nearly hits some high-heeled boots trotting by on the sidewalk.

“That’s the first time I heard him say anything nice ‘bout *anyone*,” adds Luca.

“Show me someone worth talking nice about and I’ll sing ‘em a damn song,” says Tye, and he wipes a dripping nose on the back of his mittens.

More people shuffle by, spattering the sheltered section of San Francisco sidewalk with brown water from the icy rain. Cardboard shopping bags from designer stores clack against each other like ducks on the run. The murmur of people on the phone is as constant as the jammed cars in the street beyond.

One pair of wool-suited legs and sheeny black shoes ostensibly steps aside to let a girl move past the pole of scaffolding first. He treads on Tye’s trouser leg.

“Sorry, buddy. Didn’t see you there.”

Tye narrows eyes. “Not what you say to us on the street, ‘buddy’.”

And the man moves on, pretending not to hear what he had already failed to see.

“What d’you get like that for? The guy apologised, didn’t he?” growls Cody as he pulls the hat back over his eyes. “You’re not going to make ‘em notice us any more talking up like that.” And he gives the sorry cup of mostly-quarters in his hand a single shake to make his complaint more specific.

“I tried being nice last Wednesday.” Tye turns on his side and goes to pull his sleeping bag over some apparently unassailable cold spot near his collar. But the moment he moves his shoulder, the top of the cover slips and his exposed neck gets another gust of Christmas Eve wind.

He tries again. But again the cover slips down. Furious, Tye leaps up from his mound of clothes and covers so suddenly it’s like a monster from a mound of leaves. The latest constipation of shoppers veer away from him. Glances swim past as he stands at their level—some furtive, others challenging. Cody lifts both hat and eyelids this time.

But Tye just turns his back on the passers by and reaches up for a high-neck fleece hanging to dry on a scaffolding pole. Centimetres behind is a designer showroom where plastic figures wear clothes of a quality Tye has never even felt between his fingers. The original turquoise of his fleece now better matches the colour of the Bay in torchlight, and it’s clearly flacid with wetness even before his fingers rub it to check.

“I swear these windows were heated yesterday.”

“Maybe shouldn’t a hung your shorts up there, like I told ya,” comes Luca’s squawk again.

“Where the goddam else am I going to hang ‘em, huh?”

The tent unzips and Luca’s neolithic arrow-head of a nose pokes out, illuminated by the phone he is playing on. “You see. There are certain inconveniences to being homeless, Tye. Certain things you have to go without… Like heated hanging rails.”

Tye turns and walks off.

“Hey! Where you going? Get me a coffee!”

But Tye is already embedded in the sea of shoppers, who part almost biblically, keeping half a metre away from him at all sides. He shouts loud over the honking horns of traffic—to everyone and to no one. “I’m done freezing out here! I ain’t no dog. And ain’t no dog should be freezin’ like this neither.” With that, he walks right off the sidewalk, weaving through the static congestion of mostly yellow cars, sending up more horn honks into the skyscraper-walled cavern of the business district street.

Cody is watching with both eyes now as Tye reaches the other side of the road

“Where’s that fool goin’ now?” asks Luca, straining from his tent to see.

Cody sees Tye stomping towards a policeman on the other side of the road, who is typing out a ticket on a small device in his hand. Tye pulls off the mitten of his right hand as he gets near.

“I think he’s gone hunting for a warm cell.”

The policeman, smaller than Tye in height and shoulder, looks up just as Tye is in full swing—a slap so wide-arcing and so straight-elbowed that Charlie Chaplin would have clapped.

SPAK!—grubby open palm hits cold, wet and raw cheek.

When the policeman’s face returns forward, his eyes are a fury.

Tye turns his wrists upwards and gives the policeman a look of ‘Well? Arrest me.’

And gets a fist hard in the nose. He goes down as quickly as moments ago he jumped up, clutching it.

“Try that again and I’ll shoot your damn ass off,” shouts the policeman so loudly that Cody can hear it even over the honking cars and Luca in full hysterics beside him.

The policeman finishes booking the car and keeps walking. Tye hauls himself up to a crouch. The more human of the passers by flinch to help, only to realise their hands will get dirty and so keep their help to a flinch. A young suit with a preened beard and fur-neck coat wills him to get back on his feet with awkward hands and sorry eyes. Tye does, and shakes off the hands that aren’t touching him, before stomping back across the sea of taxis to the corridor of scaffolding-covered homelessness.

“Broke my nose. That’s police brutality right there. Did anyone get a video?” He says as he staggers back to his spot.

“You... hit him first.” Luca is still laughing so hard his tent is shaking.

“That was just to get arrested. Ow.” And Tye drops back onto his stack of clothes and cardboard.

A wet fleece falls on Tye’s head like an oversized flannel. Even Cody chuckles at this.

“I’m done with this city.”

“Not before the city’s done wi’ you,” says Cody. And he pulls the white rim of his Santa hat back over his eyes as if submerging into a warm bath.

Tye spits blood into the space between his shoes and leans back—part exhaustion and part so that the blood will run back into his nose not out.

“I’m done.”

It’s then that something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Two people are distinct from the hurried stream of evening shoppers. Unlike everyone else, they are not going anywhere. They are stopped, and what is more, looking at the line of hunched men and women beneath the scaffolding in their cardboard boxes, tents or, like Tye, buried in leaf-heaps of discarded clothes. Looking at them individually.

A middle-aged lady, delicate, elegant and thin-boned—like an Audrey Hepburn taking late afternoon tea at Tiffany’s—bows down so that she may hear what her nine year old son is saying. The boy stands tall and straight like a miniature president, with brown hair neatly quiffed even where it protrudes from his high-fashion trappers’ hat. The two appear to be gradually moving along the line of strewn men and women, discussing each in turn. It is almost as if they were window-shopping, except they are not looking into the stores at all but at the people huddled in the windows’ light before them.

As they get closer, Tye can hear them.

“I’ll know when I see, Mom.”

“Okay, but we have already ‘seen’ a good many, dear… At least a type? You have a type you’re looking for perhaps?” The mother speaks with an accent so refinedly British it verges on caricature.

“Mrs Jennings says it’s rude to talk about people as types,” replies the boy, still looking at the row as he goes.

“Yes. Well. What distinguishing features, then?”

“Him,” says the boy. He is pointing directly at Tye now, who has just finished depositing two twisted knots of tissue into each nostril.

The mother smiles at Tye then leads her son out of earshot. All Tye can think about is how wonderfully smooth her skin seems.

He watches her lips and thinks she is saying something to her son about Tye being a black man. Or perhaps he is imagining it.

The boy just nods and looks up at his mother. His face stoney with decision. The mother lays a hand on his shoulder and nods an okay, before returning to Tye and bending down respectfully to his level. Cody and Luca are all ears and eyes now too.

“Hello there. I do hope we’re not bothering you…”

“It’s fine—begging kind of just happens.”

She gets the joke quickly. Not like most people he speaks to. And her teeth gleam in the store window’s light as she smiles. “What’s your name, might I ask?”

“Tyson. But they call me Tye.”

“Well, this is Jonathan. And I am Mrs Peterson. I hope you don’t mind my asking, but what happened to your nose? You were... fighting?”

Her effort to hide any judgment shows just how much judgment there actually is, eddying around her question.

“Fighting? Me! Ha! No. I only do hugs.”

His humour makes the truth more palatable and she smirks, eyes sparkling beyond the cosmetically-enhanced norm. Jonathan leaves her cashmere-jacketed side and steps forward.

“We want to invite you for Christmas lunch,” says Jonathan with impressive simplicity.

Her mother lays a flustered hand on his shoulder as if to steady his directness, and says with an almost angelic warmth, “Yes. It would be a great pleasure if you’d come.”

Tye just stares at them.

Mrs Peterson sees she clearly needs to do some explaining and gives a little cough as dainty as most people’s giggles.

“Erm. We’ll be entirely honest... I would love to say this offer comes only from the goodness of our hearts. But as well as wanting very much to give you a good meal, along with access to sanita... our bathroom facilities, and some new clothes, it would also be helping us. You see, Jonathan needs to demonstrate he is engaging with the community. For his university applications you understand.”

“He’s what, nine?”

“Exactly right. But the earlier the better—we don’t want the admissions people thinking he only did the said ‘engaging’ for the sake of his application, you-”

“-understand. Sure. Got it.” Tye eyes the boy, who is either compliant to the point of servility or actually genuinely wants this. “So let me get this straight—you want me to come to your house, have a bath... I get a bath right?”

“Yes.”

“And new clothes? And a meal?”

“New*ish* clothes, yes. Goose and all the trimmings too. Made by my own fair hands.” She gives a laugh like the shiver of a chandelier. “What do you say? Tomorrow at eleven thirty? We live on the top of 22nd street.”

Tye feels Cody and Luca’s eyes, and knows Luca is less than a second away from volunteering in his stead.

“Sure. Deal.”

“Splendid. Here’s our address.” She hands him a card from her neat little tan leather purse and smiles more pearls before straightening like a swan looking to the sky, and gliding with the boy off into the stream of shoppers. Jonathan turns and gives Tye a wave through a flurry of sleet.

Tye musters enough positivity to wave back. The kid smiles.

“And you say you don’t ever get no lucky break…” grumbles Luca.

“Not quite sure what this is,” says Tye, to everyone and no one.

“City ain’t done with you yet,” says Cody.

Now,  many people make fun of that and say it's from student days when you  had to watch your spending etc, but that got me thinking: if only  everyone lived like a student we could cut down on so much waste! When  we grow up we are told we need to grow and consume, and everyone forgets  to be mindful of their consumption and limited resources. They forget  to live in the moment and enjoy it, without the need to buy and waste  stuff just for the sake if it.

Many deniers say that humans didn't cause climate change. That is the one of the saddest, shift the blame scenarios I have ever heard in my life. Let me ask them this: would you put your face in front of your car's exhaust pipe and just inhale it in? Would you sit in your closed garage while your motor runs and pumps all that waste into the space around you? That kind of thing would get you killed! What is the difference between doing that and pumping it into the air? Just because it flies away and you can't see it anymore doesn't mean it just goes away. It's dirty pollution! There's no way you can sit there and say that this isn't having an impact on the environment, not when there's 7 billion people on the planet and all of them need some form of transportation. Buses, trains, planes, trucks, all of these things burn that same nasty black smoke into the air. There's no way there isn't a repercussion from everyone pumping all that sickness into the air and it's insane to act like ""well humans didn't do that."" Bologni. Even if you could prove humans didn't cause this, climate change is still happening!

Then they just ignore all the images and videos of the disasters around us. Ice caps melt, the Amazon burns, Australia burns, areas flood, areas have famine. Don't worry though it's ""just another ice age"" or ""the planet has always changed"" or worse yet ""it's a tax evasion scheme."" Excuse me? There's a lot of wacky things going on in the environment and you want me to just sit back and say ""ah it's no big deal. Things will work themselves out."" Madness I tell you, pure madness. Even for the sake of argument, say 30 years down the road scientists' predictions were wrong and it's not as big a deal as it seems, why on Earth would you smack down anyone who wants to try and help the planet? Electric vehicles, solar panels, sustainable businesses, less plastic, less slaughterhouses, more trees, etc. etc. etc.

How could anyone normal, functioning human being turn that down? You can sit here and name a win win win scenario in so many ways and the deniers will challenge that. I just can't. Even if you take the title of climate change away, people will still fight it and resist it or say ""Well we're already reducing emissions."" They just pull these hypothetical, no data supported arguments right out of the wild, saying whatever fits the weird programmed agenda they have inside of them. That is not how an intelligent person is supposed to hold a conversation. You don't just say things, you don't just quote what you heard on tv because they have the money to be a major network. You don't just recycle what you watch on youtube or read just because an article was published. Adolf Hitler has a book, it doesn't mean that anything he did was justified at all. 

The environment is something that affects and protects us all and yet we destroy it and all the other creatures that rely on it. We've taken something that is integral to existence as we know it and wrapped it up into politics, one of the worst time wasting, human dividing things that have ever or will ever exist. It's become fused into this system of nonsense and now we all have to operate through this system of nonsense in order to save ourselves. Do you see how ridiculous this all is? I should never have to vote or try to persuade others to vote in order to save our planet. It shouldn't even be a factor on a ballot because it should be protected and nurtured regardless of anything else we battle over for as long as human beings shall live. The environment should take priority over anything else we have going on, period.

But here we are. Living in the US you hear all these magical words like ""bipartisanship"" and ""freedom"" and an assortment of things to make you believe the system works. Why is it so hard for people to work together? Is it really so bad if a Democrat or a Republican receded on a point and said ""well maybe I'm wrong"" or ""You're right. Let's try that."" I know these people have vested interests but where are the ones to value something more like, ya know, humanity? Any relationship you ever have with another human being has to come with compromise. You give, you take. Unfortunately the climate has ended up as one of those polarizing issues, one of those things where people are completely split on it. It's like a child caught in the middle of an ugly divorce and only one side is going to get full custody.

People act like it's so hard to hear another candidate and, Heaven forbid, change their mind. I'm trying to be open here but I still have no hope for the Republican party coming through on this end. Imagine how terrible this must make Republican believers feel. Their voices are shrouded by the nonsense that people like our President bellow. The Democrats can yell and kick and scream about Trump but it changes nothing. All this money wasted on slamming the president when it could've gone to anything more productive. Nancy Pelosi wastes all this energy trying to get Trump impeached when he'll never get evicted from the White House. All that money could be used on sustainability or renewable energy. 

And to what end does this all play out? People vote for Trump because they want to be loyal to party lines? Because he's a real ""man""? Because he makes the ""hard choices for us that we need""? How could a man who has proven himself to be sexist, racist, doesn't listen, abuses social media more than the ""millennials"" he cries about all the time, only concerned with self interests and his money, takes orders from another foreign leader, contradicts what he says daily, and is oddly explicit about the way he talks about his daughter, ever going to be right or true or helpful to a country of people who are supposed to be the 'big brother' of the planet? Trite.

Are you trying to save face to your friends? You know there's total privacy when voting right? It's not like all your work buddies or friends are watching you vote with a big tattoo on your head of who you pick. Is it loyalty? You pick a side and you stay there forever, no matter what? Is that what's important? People were loyal to Hitler too. Literally as the planet is dying, you stand there on your pedestal, bragging about how you helped saved the world for any old reason that hits home as the planet is being destroyed everywhere but your home first? That's the juxtaposition of humans. The world is crumbling, burning, flooding, and eating away at itself and the people who give up the power to the destroyers believe they are the ones who saved it. There are no words, no words with enough might to punch an indention of sense into a haven of stupidity like that. It's like congratulating cancer. It's like believing a gunshot to the head made you stronger. It's like saying that if I burn down my house then a mansion will appear. It's not magic, it's not up for debate, it has nothing to do with taxes or money. It's climate change, it's real, it's here and it is killing us.

Every time you gain a sliver of hope some malicious monster with a keyboard will dash everything you feel to ribbons. Greta is a 16 year old girl who has done more with her life than anyone I've seen her age. No matter how distraught she becomes at the situation, she remains civil. An endless number of message boards and forums across the internet say anything they can possibly construct to try and destroy her. They treat their words as if they are bullets and figure if they fire enough, one can finally reach her and destroy her cause. These are grown adults. Fathers, mothers, grandparents, aunts, uncles; all spewing the same evil rhetoric. And about a minor no less, a minor. She's old enough to know what she's doing but to deserve that kind of treatment and at her age no less is barbaric. Society would hunt down and rip apart anyone who ever spoke that way of an infant or a toddler. Anyone who so much as harms a baby in anyway will be punished by anyone with the hands to do it, even among prisoners there's enough of a code of honor to maintain that notion. Yet this is the reality. Because she is on the news, because she says what adults ignore or lie to themselves or illusion themselves against, it can someone be allowed to roast her. We see daily how the internet can be used as an instrument for mental torment and there are still people who throw their time and energy and use of their keyboards into not just fighting with but attempting to destroy who she is at a fundamental level. What has humanity created? This is worse than most things I've seen in fiction and they had a lot of real monsters and demons. 

I suppose that is the nature of a demon. It takes a form of the familiar and rots our intentions from the inside like a molding fruit. Decay, decay, decay, and then, disaster is all that's left. Human beings: creatures capable of such greatness, love, and creation are going to allow a select few to use their power and influence to brainwash us into evil, tiny tyrants that destroy. So distorted from the capabilities of who and what we could be into a shadow that could only faintly be made out to be human. This is supposed to be how we die, how the human race complacence itself into demise. Because people like grandpa watched too much of the same tv channel and pissed and moaned until he convinced others and voted and that was it.

I think it is about time we started taking responsibility for this planet of ours. These photos are just a very small representation of what's happening. We are a human race are facing droughts, famine, floods, global warming, wars, racism, and climate change on scales we have never seen before. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! We are living in a world in which people are more self centred than ever. We dont need these attitudes. The planet doesn't need anymore successful people our planet needs peace makers, story tellers, healers, restores and people who want change for our planet!  Start taking action now! ONLY YOU CAN MAKE THIS CHANGE! Things you can do to help change this world for the better include;
-being kind to everybody and I mean everybody. Not just your family members you need to be kind to that homless man on the street or the cashier at the till. Spread your love and kindness!

0,"**The definition of data is any type of information, statistics, or facts collected for research and analysis. In a very dynamic domain such as Environmental Monitoring where the climate or ambient air quality conditions are dependent on multiple variables, the environmental data collection is of utmost importance. It is through this environmental monitoring that scientists/researchers will be able to provide answers to problems related to deteriorating environmental conditions. This will in turn help in making informed decisions and analyze new insights backed by scientific data.**

**In the current scenario, You look at the internet for the environment data but don’t find sufficient data to analyze the change. That’s an environmental data vacuum – the absence of environmental data.**

### Why is that?

**Environmental data is generated through environmental monitoring. And the data scarcity is due to insufficient ambient monitoring for collecting enough data and processing it to generate useful information. Of course, we have weather stations installed at strategic locations, but they only monitor weather parameters like temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation amounts for weather prediction and forecasting. They do not provide information about pollution – their concentration, sources, and distribution, and hence, the need for environmental monitoring.**

We can and should put policy in place that hemp fiber gets a tax *break* whilst tree fiber gets huge tax *penalities*.  This would massively *incentivize* a transition towards better environmental protections and innovations.  So apart from incentivizing hemp fiber, what are other environmentally conscious policies can we put in place.  I will trust that you the people can come up with a better solution than me on my own, and we can take that better solution to Washington.  Why aren't we doing this already?

0,"Doubtless this has been asked before. Sorry for the duplication.

We have known climate change was an existential threat to industrialised civilisation for over 30 years now. It has become apparent in recent years that the threat had been underestimated. And yet greenhouse emissions are still rising, the population is still rising, and we have made no progress whatsoever in making systemic changes. For example, though the UK government has accepted climate change is a serious threat to civilisation and must be stopped, it nevertheless decided, after very lengthy deliberations, that it is necessary to expand Heathrow Airport. The reason is that if this doesn't happen, the Dutch will expand their capacity and threaten Heathrow's position as the most important aviation hub in Europe. This is madness. Unfortunately, it is also reality. 

We are not going to stop climate change. Even if we did everything humanly possible to stop it, there's probably 3 to 4 degrees “baked into the cake”. And the politics says we won't do everything possible. This isn't about ""should"" or ""shoudn't"". It's about ""won't"".

This is about global co-operation, or the impossibility of it. We have no hope of even getting one major sovereign state to agree internally to the sort of sacrifices neeed (banning cheap air travel, limiting population growth, etc....). But to actually stop the eco-catastrophe, we'd have to get all the major sovereign states to agree between them to make those sacrifices. This is pure fantasy. It can't happen in the real world. On the contrary – in the difficult times to come, what is actually going to take place is a desperate fight for survival, at all sorts of levels. If the human race couldn't get together to sort out its differences during the “good times” (ecologically), how can we seriously expect it to do so when there's a collapse coming? 

There are some things humans simply can't fix. Things like poverty, war, or widespread mental illness and substance abuse. We can help in specific cases , but we can't eliminate the general problem. It's like this with climate change and the wider environmental problem. We can reduce emissions in some manner, in some places. We eradicated CFCs. But the only thing that's going to stop industrialised civilisation in general from emitting greenhouse gases and generally screwing up the ecosystem is industrialised civilisation stopping. Or at least getting a lot smaller. 

If this is true – if we really can't stop climate change – then what is the point in continuing to pretend we can? What do we have to lose, in the long run, by proclaiming publicly that we believe it is already too late? 

If this is true, then sooner or later this is going to be widely understood, and our public discourse and politics will have to change to reflect it. This may be extremely uncomfortable, but surely if it is unavoidable, there is no benefit in delaying the point where it is widely understoodWhy does anybody still (say they) believe we can stop climate change?"

0,"I will most likely be down voted for criticising team trees, I know if I dare make these comments on anything related to team trees I will not be heard. 

Now hear me out before you make a judgement, before I continue I'd like you all to know I have nothing against planting trees, in fact plant as much as you like or donate as much to planting as you like, giving to charity with good intentions is always honourable and I will never say it is wrong. 

The purpose of this is just to make people aware of what they may not know. 

The slogan behind team trees has been a considerable focus on co2 emissions being taken up by these 20 million trees. This is true of course. They also provide habitats for animals which is brilliant as we are continuously breaking them down, I dont want to take away the merits of this organization. The issue I want to raise is the significance of trees in co2 emissions, nothing else. And this issue is that your money can be better spent somewhere else if you want to reduce co2. 

The oceans are our primary resource of oxygen (50-85% of earths oxygen https://earthsky.org/earth/how-much-do-oceans-add-to-worlds-oxygen), which also makes them our primary source of co2 uptake. They take up about 1/3 of our co2. Trees do not even come close to this amount. There are sources below, but I'll explain it real easy here, at the peak of a trees life (10 years in) they take up the equivalent to 2 humans CO2, humans produce about 2.3 pounds a day of CO2. Oceans take up about 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. Issue with this is, there are 7 billion of us, youd need about 2 trees per person if you maintain them, and 7 trees in the wild if you do not, that is a ridiculous amount, which just is not possible.

Right now as this time farms, forests and plants take up roughly 28% of all co2 emission, which is already less than the 1/3 oceans do. However the issue is, we are polluting our oceans far more than we are our trees, we can replant trees, we can maintain that amount, but we cannot make up for the ocean with just trees. 

If you're still not convinced consider that trees when they die and rot release almost as much co2 in the atmosphere than they take up, oceans do not, the ocean creates co2 beds and stores them from being released. Yet right now trees have gotten far more consideration than the ocean has because of this. All I want is for people to pay attention to both, because our oceans are more at risk than our forests are.

0,"Pricing has been determined, for a large part directly or indirectly, by the cost of manufacturing. This is now broken. There are just too many of us buying and throwing away shit.

What makes sense is that the cost of a product should include the cost of disposing and/or recycling. If someone makes a car that costs more to make, but much less to dispose of or recycle, then she should be able to sell it for less while making the same profit margin. Good will or gov subsidy are not sustainable and subject to human corruption.

But if the cost is charged to the manufacturer, through some international agreement and enforcement, this would create strong incentives for R&amp;D and manufacturing, as well as consumption, to move toward a sustainable economy.

Obviously calculating the cost is not trivial, but is fundamentally a solvable problem. As long as a problem is solvable, it will be solved given enough incentive.

Who should be charged with calculating the cost?

Government, as usual, should be among the last choices. All the gov needs to do is to set up the legislation and enforcement machinery.

No coral reefs = No habitats for specific fish = The dying of those fish = Dietary restrictions for predators = Dying predators = Even less of a food source = Even more fish dying = An excess of Co2 in the water which means the plants will start dying due to algae blooms which means no sunlight reaches past the top layer of the ocean which means all life that lives in the ocean will inevitably die off due to either,

A) No available or maintainable food source

B) No available oxygen left to support so much life

Which means that our biggest oxygen producer, which is where we get I believe 50-85% of the oxygen we breathe every day, will be completely destroyed. And then one can only assume that only the rich will be able to afford tickets to Mars to continue to consume another planet. Which means YOU and all the other 7,000,000,000+ people are left to scavenge whats remaining of the earth until you inevitably die from,

A) Cannibalism

B) Lack of oxygen blood flow to the numerous vital parts of your body

C) Die off due to illness

D) All of the above

This is just ONE of the MANY ways just ONE person can affect the ocean all because they simply say “it’s just one wrapper or piece of plastic” and proceed to toss it out the window while they drive. Now imagine 5,000,000,000 people saying that exact same thing throughout the day/week/month/year. Thats a lot of garbage. I know this was long, and i know many will choose to skip over this because they dont care. But if every reddit user read this and thought twice about making a small change like not throwing that Mcdonalds bag out of the window because you don’t want to make that extra 5-10 second walk to throw it in the garbage at home, you would be quite surprised at the improvement you would see with ecosystems in the world around you. 

To leave you with something to make you think again, if we don’t change these things. Within the next 10-20 years, almost all of the reefs will bleach and die. Please think twice, and don’t think of this as a “save the planet” movement. Think of it as “save yourselves, and your children, and theirs” movement. Progress, don’t make the effort to decline over a split second decision. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. :)“It’s just one bag”"
0,"Funny how a lot environmentalist are full of intentions but really do nothing meaningful to change the situation. They go about wanting the governments to change laws and policies to take care of the climate, while they continue their consumer ways. For example, maybe not purchasing imported products, etc. that have a negative impact on the environment (through transport, cutting down of forests for growth, use of toxic materials for production, etc.) would be the real start to change. Funny thing is people protesting on the streets, then going home to eat fruits from another country (just an example) with a clean conscience. But I guess people don't want to make the little sacrifices needed (like growing vegetables if they have some space for a couple of pots). They want the actions to be taken for them and not by them. Eating indigenous foods and canning them would be a good start. But who likes to prepare and eat canned foods?... It's easier to tell the government: ''Hey I don't want those delicious mangoes from another country in my supermarket, we need laws and policies to prevent me from buying them because we all know I'm too dumb to do that by myself!"" It's all just like cold philanthropy where money fills deep pockets, little goes to research and the donor gets a tax cut. The difference here is that the tax cut is: a clean conscience, a feeling of self-righteousness and belonging to a social group that reinforces the first two for the sake of the third.Some truth about and for environmentalists"

The Stradivarius violin is unique because it was made with wood from trees that had lived through a short ice age during the middle ages which made the rings in the wood more compact and hence difficult to reproduce. The rings in the trunk the trees from that period and plenty other indicators show that there was a little ice age during the middle ages.

All that, at periods where humans did not pollute as much if at all. Yes, we are messing up the environment but to what extent and to what effect is another question.

That would be the biggest drop on record, and has been led by a large decline in the amount of thermal coal used by U.S. and European power stations.""  

In addition, in its efforts to become more coal independent, China is importing less coal, hence less coal production in Australia and the U.S. (those that are destined for export).Coal consumption decreased in 2019, the biggest on record."

0,"This is what capitalism does to the planet. The consumer is consumed by their incessant desire to consume. Capital makes people want things they don’t need. And due to the planet having such a large population, the production of everything is always on a massive scale. Emissions destroy the O-Zone layer. The O-Zone layer is a protective layer. The O-Zone layer is destroyed. The Sun is not having to go through this protective filter anymore. It’s causing the planet to heat up. That has caused ice caps to melt. That has raised sea levels. That has caused more frequent, and stronger, severe weather that has wrecked havoc all across the globe. Yes it still snows even though it’s called global warming. It is called global warming because the planet as a whole is heating up because the Sun’s heat is more intense because the O-Zone layer has been destroyed due to massive ammounts of emissions being released into the atmosphere which is where the O-Zone is located. “Weirder” winters, where it can either reach record highs or record lows; either way, it’s severely out of balance. Severe summers; more rain, leading to flooding, and/or drier summers leading to droughts and fires. And again, everything is on a massive scale. In Australia bats literally fall from the sky because of the heat, and koalas are stopping cyclists and drinking their water intuitively because animals f***ing understand what’s going on! They know they’re losing their homes! They know they’re losing their resources! Evolution take hundreds of thousands of years, and no species (including us, including PLANTS) is physically able to adapt in time. People are also losing their homes due to natural disasters; you may remember hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, etc.. We can’t forget the forest fires, the earthquakes, the tsunamis. Corporations are Not going to change because they are capitalism and capitalism is about consuming. The rich (and I mean Really rich) care about one thing, and that’s accumulating more wealth, and without any interest in taking responsibility for the hell they put the planet and everyone on it through. Capitalism is inherently Evil, period! Stop blaming evil for being evil! It ends when YOU choose to end it! You end it by LOVING YOURSELF! You are enough! You don’t need a new phone to take mirror pics and show everyone what you can BUY! Your self-love cannot be conditional on the Internet’s validation of your superficial self. YOU ARE ENOUGH! And if you’re afraid no one loves you, well guess what - I LOVE YOU! You are a human! And you are stronger than the evil your government has forced upon you! The change has to be made by you, shown through your ACTIONS! You can do it! Let’s make 2020 the start of a decade in which we TEAR DOWN WALLS AND BUILD BRIDGES!

When you give a kid this much “power” and influence, they don’t know how to cope when being put in the workforce, which is where they finally realize they're brainwashed and unprepared for reality. They're out of their coddling environment and left lost and dissatisfied and it leads them to feel like *failures*. It’s so sad. They’re raising them the same way they raised millennials (but it’s even worse because of social media’s reach and power). I think it's all a ploy to expand the proletariat class.

0,"Plastic is a petrochemical. Petrochemical use is growing 7X faster than human population. By 2030 more oil will be used for petrochemicals than burned in cars every year. 

Oil is shipped to China, turned into plastic, shipped to you, discarded, shipped back to Asia where it is burned or dumped into the ocean. Plastic does not dissolve, it nano-granulates. Plastic is burned for electricity in Sweden. 

Plastic is eaten by fish, and gets eaten by you. You eat 4 credit cards worth of plastic per month. You drink  and breathe plastic. Nano-plastic is very attracted to nano-toxins. Nano-toxins enter your body through your skin, stomach and lungs, where they enter the bloodstream and start to eat the blood barrier to your brain. Many nanoparticles come from engine combustion, and tire and brake wear. I believe tire particles are a major cause of asthma.

Magnetite nano-particles from engine combustion go up your nose and straight inside your brain. The epigenetic effects of nanotoxicity will affect our kids, and their kid's kids with cumulative irreversible unstoppable consequences.

I hope you guys are all safe and having a good time. I know you all made your resolutions, and ready to change things for the better this year.

I did too. My new year's resolution is to add my contribution to fixing the planet.

Last year, I saw Aurora's talk on ""Outrage &amp; Optimism"" ([https://youtu.be/5yMwiif8iLw](https://youtu.be/5yMwiif8iLw?fbclid=IwAR15kDTXp--_jx8Cyv1XFzBMNAOLELnvcE5Oh6G3Mio8GSVXu_ySo_IwERk)). She said that she wants to be a part of the generation that will be remembered as the generation that fixed the dying planet, and not the one that killed it. This was quite inspirational and got me thinking... and since I am a problem solver as a software engineer, I asked myself a question of how I would approach solving a larger and non-trivial problem like this.

Of course, before thinking of a solution, you have to understand what is causing the problem, and after some time of carefully thinking about the issue, I found the culprit, something that can actually be fixed and is the root cause. The culprit is the mass culture of consumerism (not capitalism by itself as a lot of people believe). An addictive mass culture that both kills the planet and takes away our freedom at the same time.

I also understood that it is this culture that keeps us isolated, lonely and, because of this, hooked.

I was also fascinated and inspired by Greta's movement for climate action, but the solution that came to my mind wasn't related to politics and believing that it is the responsibility of politicians to solve this.

I realized that the solution will be to unplug from the culture of consumerism. But how? By becoming self-sufficient.

I knew that off-the-grid living is something that the world already knows about and isn't something viral and doesn't seem to become a way of life of the many. A lot of people think that you have to go off every grid to unplug. But it is not true.

I propose a model of life that I call ""Unit of Self-Sufficiency"" that I believe is a much more flexible approach. It will be a bit lengthy to describe it here, so I wrote a mini-book explaining my vision. You can find it here: [https://aeroaquaponic.org](https://aeroaquaponic.org/?fbclid=IwAR2zzfCvPWUvtAZiub-4jfx2RT-IPcQYEh4o4GoXa5pdpTVzP-rfoUeb0x4)

I don't know whether this is THE solution, but this is certainly something that I am going to dedicate myself to from now on. I am also dedicating myself to sharing all of the knowledge that I will get along the way with all of you, and I hope you will find it useful.

Happy new year!I wrote a small book where I propose a solution to environmental crisis. What do you think?"
0,"I am two days into my trip to India, coming from the US. So far, I have seen almost no trash cans either outside or inside buildings. Where does the trash go? The streets. The grass. Anywhere people can leave it (which is basically anywhere). Animals, including cows and dogs, roam the streets looking for food, and often consume that trash. Pollution in India is not something to be overlooked. The heaps of trash I see every second I'm outside, coupled with the heavy use of automobiles, has led to heavily polluted air - to the point that I can see and smell the smoke from fuel in the air. Land and water pollution are a given. 

India's waste management system relies on using poor communities and streets as dumps. A plastic bag ban has been implemented, and it's a start, but it's not stopping people from littering.

0,"Hey all-

I have some heavy thoughts that I wanted input on. Like all of us here, I read a lot about ecology, climate change, natural sciences, etc. The consensus seems to be ""we're almost at the point of no return- we need to act now!"" 

As an eco-communist, I philosophically agree. But the time for revolution and ecological regenerative practices needed to start decades ago. 

Realistically, the collective global society is going to continue with what it's doing. It seems like the time is long gone for us to repair or regenerate the eco-disaster we're in. I can't shake the feeling that all these calls for action are inauthentic. By all accounts, it looks like we are \*far\* past the ""point of no return."" And I'm not sure why we continue to act like salvation or reversal is possible. It's not. From biodiversity decimation, to monocropping, to antibiotic-resistant superbugs, to climate change, to ocean pollution, to carbon-dioxide-infested air, to the deforestation of the Amazon (and everywhere), to factory farming, to indigenous genocide, to the hundreds (thousands?) of tons of plastic produced and dumped per day, to nuclear contamination, to fascism, to capitalism, and so on...I don't see why the conversation is about us ""not being out of time"" and ""voting"" (which is an illusion of action) and ""community gardening"" or whatever.

The only ""solution"" is the destruction of capitalism, which doesn't seem to be disappearing any time soon. Realistically, we need everyone to quit their jobs and overthrow their governments in every country across the world. We need a global, interconnected peoples to focus on nature and abandon whatever menial 9-5 jobs that aren't related to politics/activism, natural sciences (or tech), or regenerative agriculture. Capitalist governments are run by the mega-corporations that are destroying the earth and killing all of us. They will not concede power willingly. We cannot vote our way out of a broken and exploitative system. 

We are out of time. Shouldn't we be talking about eco-revolution? Or how to survive in a post-collapse world? The conversation needs to stop being a lie about how we have time left to act. We do not. We need to act like we fucked up and it's game over. We need to embody the mentality that we ran out of time and now we're in survival mode. 

It's like writing a paper for school. When you have 4 months to write it, you don't stress. When the paper is due in 12 hours, you freak the fuck out and scramble to do the best job you can within the time constraint. That's where we are at.

0,"Trump recently launched a new website titled [snowflakevictory.com](https://snowflakevictory.com), which aims to help Trump supporters win arguments with liberals (""snowflakes""), particularly liberal relatives. One of the sections is titled ""Trump is proving it's possible to have a strong economy and a clean environment at the same time"", and reads

&gt;People may incorrectly tell you that President Trump is doing nothing to help our environment, but the facts tell a different story.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump continues to advance realistic solutions to reduce emissions while promoting economy growth.  
&gt;  
&gt;America’s environmental record is one of the strongest in the world and the U.S. has also been a world leader in reducing carbon emissions for over a decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have the cleanest air on record and remain a global leader for access to clean drinking water. President Trump has taken important steps to restore, preserve, and protect our land, air, and waters.  
&gt;  
&gt;Meanwhile, China will remain the chief emitter of CO2 – emitting more than the US and the EU combined.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump has paved the way for more energy infrastructure development, ensuring American energy can be delivered.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump approved the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Keystone XL Pipeline, and the New Burgos Pipeline.  
&gt;  
&gt;America is now the world’s largest oil producer and in 2017 the United States became a net natural gas exporter for the first time in 60 years!  
&gt;  
&gt;Crude oil exports nearly doubled in 2018, reaching a record average of 2 million barrels a day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Coal exports reached their highest level in five years in 2018  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks to President Trump’s negotiations, the European Union agreed to import more Liquid Natural Gas from the United States – resulting in a 272% increase in exports to the EU.

I thought that I wanted to work for a think tank, as I have a good knowledge of international relations as well as study abroad experience. However, with the climate crisis and the apocalypse practically at hand, I can't help but feel powerless. On the one hand, I really do want to try and make the world a better place for us and our future generations. I have already committed to not buying a car or a house until I see SIGNIFICANT action at the hand of our politicians, and I have been trying to lessen my environmental footprint as well by eating less meat, using less water, and so on. I nonetheless just feel a harrowing sense of despair when I read the news, and it almost makes me wonder why I should even bother with living if the Earth is going to be in flames in 50 years. I hate to be dramatic, but really, what the fuck is the point of even trying to lead a normal life at this point? I don't want to live in an apocalyptic world, and if there is no way to make things better, then why bother? (and no, I am not su1c1dal.)

&amp;#x200B;

0,"Hey, everyone. I have a question that I'd appreciate some input for. I'm not 100% sure that this subreddit is the best place to post, so if there's a better thread, please point me in that direction.

Quick context: I'm a student pilot. Aviation is my life's passion, and I can't see myself going into anything else. However, I can't shake the fact that aviation is among the worst things for the environment. Since the FAA requires me to keep a logbook of all of my flights , I decided that, in addition to making lifestyle choices to reduce my carbon footprint (going vegetarian, shorter showers, buying fewer clothes, etc), I'd use my logbook to eventually carbon offset all of my flying. The logbook requires me to log how much time I'm in the air, the aircraft I'm flying, and what I worked on, so I'll know if I did a bunch of touch-and-gos to work on takeoffs/landings.

I started researching potential carbon offsets, and I've heard that a lot of companies (is that what they are?) that do them act really unethically (e.g. they drive indigenous peoples off their lands to plant trees) or are ineffective (e.g. they go through on their carbon offset, but they produce their own emissions in the process without offsetting their own). 

Which companies do y'all know of are certified ethical and effective? Which are the best carbon offsets to get, and who should I get them from to guarantee the best effect?

Thanks for your help.Best Carbon Offsets?"
0,"Using the latest data available, they have outlined how 143 countries around the world can switch to 100 percent clean energy by the year 2050.  This plan could not only contribute towards stabilising our dangerously increasing global temperatures, but also reduce the 7 million deaths caused by pollution every year and create millions more jobs than keeping our current systems.  The plan would require a hefty investment of around US$73 trillion. But the researchers' calculations show the jobs and savings it would earn would pay this back in as little as seven years.

""Based on previous calculations we have performed, we believe this will avoid 1.5 degree global warming,"" environmental engineer and lead author Mark Jacobson [told ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/stanford-researchers-have-a-plan-to-tackle-the-climate-emergency). ""The timeline is more aggressive than any IPCC scenario - we concluded in 2009 that a 100 percent transition by 2030 was technically and economically possible - but for social and political reasons, a 2050 date is more practical.""

0,"I am in the market for a consumer-level carbon offsetting/credit product. After a bit of searching, the only thing that looked reasonable (in the UK) was [CO2nsensus](co2nsensus.com) and their sister company [CO2mission](co2mission.com). I went for the latter, which is subscription based, but a number of alarm bells are ringing:

* Numerous misspellings on their website.
* A UK company, but takes payment in USD.
* I found it very difficult to find any third-party information (e.g., news articles, reviews, etc.) online about them.
* As a UK company, I would have guessed they would be applicable for charitable status — which I’m happy to be proven wrong about — but there’s no mention of this.

Before I spend more money with them, or recommend them to others, I want to check what you all think. Is this a known scam, or is it just a startup in its embryonic stage? If the former, can anyone recommend an alternative product?Ask: Are CO2nsensus and CO2mission legit?"

The ""megafires"" now dwarf and surround our city.

The air here is full of smoke dust, and is now the equivalent of smoking 38 cigarettes a day. As I'm writing, there is a gale blowing outside, the sky is thick brown, and I can't open the window because of the toxic dust. Also, I can't afford air conditioning, so I spend most spare moments in this Xmas period at the local shopping centre (mall). Most afternoons, there is an eerie yellow glow in the air, and all of those yellow / orange / brown tinted photos you’re seeing online with the apocalyptic red / orange sun are for real - I can stare directly at the sun most days. 

Further north, near another large city, Brisbane (in the state of Queensland), large fires also burn. And to our South East, not too far away, our capital city, Canberra is today completely shrouded in thick grey smoke. In fact, the major highway between Sydney and Canberra is currently closed. In the states of NSW and QLD combined, an area of 2.5 million hectares has been burned black, an area now larger than the country of Denmark.

Now keep in mind as you read this next bit that we are a modern developed nation…

Our Prime Minister Scott Morrison took a holiday to Hawaii as soon as the disaster struck...I know. What the fuck? He then headed to New York City for the opening of a megachurch, while back home over 500 homes were burning to the ground. No amount of happy-clapping and sing-songing prayers could save them. 

Morrison refused to release any emergency funds to the Rural Fire Services - a collection of state-by-state volunteer organisations that call on everyday people to temporarily abandon their jobs and their own threatened homes and families to go out and fight the fires in their local areas. So far 2 RFS volunteer firefighters have died amid shocking conditions, while local RFS divisions conduct desperate crowdfunding campaigns, begging for basic supplies such as face masks and bottled water. 

Not only did Morrison's federal government refuse to allocated an emergency fund, but the state government of NSW, run by Premier (Governor) Gladys Berejiklian this year slashed $12.9 million from the operational budget of Fire and Rescue NSW, and $26.7 million from the RFS - before the bushfire season had even commenced.   

I could go on about government action and inaction on climate change in this country, but sufficed to say that both major sides and almost all levels of politics and government are completely failing us, and failing the world. Our country's natural beauty is fast being eroded, while our contribution to climate change is overt and pig-headed.

And I sit here typing, while the leaves on the trees outside churn in a raging wind storm of disgusting smoke dust. Sometimes it's turbulent like this, but mostly it's still, unnerving. Hot breezes cut thinly through heavy yellow air; the smell of burning; the painful itch on the throat; the confusion and frustration and betrayal.For our international friends, this is what is happening in Australia"

Renewables have risen just  **0.09** percentage point in that same time frame! Let me remind you that coal plant CO2 emissions are very high, while gas is now produced mostly via fracking which [emits methane](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/8/15/20805136/climate-change-fracking-methane-emissions).

In fact, the most famous anti-littering public service announcement, 1971’s “[Crying Indian](https://youtu.be/8Suu84khNGY)” TV commercial [specifically engaged in racial shaming of whites](https://vdare.com/posts/1971-crying-indian-anti-littering-psa-and-racial-shaming) as pointing out that we were uglying up with our littering this beautiful country we took over from the American Indians.

We could probably do something similar with shaming Latinos into not uglying up this beautiful country so much, except that the whole concept that Latinos litter too much is considered, by the conventional wisdom, to be some kind of genocidal dog whistle.

Why this insanity?

I think because progressives tend to have a lot of deep dark racist thoughts that feel like they can only suppress with an immense effort, like Dr. Strangelove’s urge to shout Heil Hitler, by projecting all their racist disgust on to extremely sane and positive-minded people like me who see problems and think about ways to ameliorate them.

There is so much information out there, it’s hard to keep track of what’s the most important, and what would be the most effective. I think this leads to confusion...and then inaction.

For example:

We talk a lot about personal action (bike to work, less meat, but local, less air travel, no more aerosol disco parties), but maybe all that’s such a small impact that it’s missing the point? I can’t remember.

Maybe it’s some sort of carbon tax, or some specific industry we need to regulate, or trade tariffs on countries behaving badly. If it’s something along those lines, then the biggest thing we need to do is vote the right people into power, I suppose. What specifically is the most import societal change to vote for?

Is it quick-as possible energy source change? Maybe we need to go nuclear right this second. Should we bring that up again, is that our biggest hope?

# My dream

My dream is that there is an online community (it can start here), working on solutions to help solving this issue:

* How can we make people in our own country aware of the real problem ?
* Can we organize, think, debate, so that we come out with a real action plan in every country ?
* Is there actually an online community like this ?

&amp;#x200B;

For example:

I am the cofounder of a company in France, helping 13-18 students to master their high school degree.  
We have a big influence on youtube, with 1M views a month.  
I plan to inform them about the challenges we face, and solutions, like eat less meat, buy more 2nd hand, etc.  


To me, this is a real solution. Informing people is something.

I know there are many many ways we can help:

* Informing
* Political activism
* Technology

I know it can sound naive, but after looking on the internet, I have found no active community giving real action plans.

* Would you like to be part of a community like this ?
* Do you know something that can help me in my research ?

0,"There have been several posts comparing EV efficiency by including the power source in the calculation, but they are often using confusing calculations (thermal efficiency ...) that don't always make sense. The most straight forward and available numbers I can think of are those of CO2 emissions per driven km. We can get direct data for any modern diesel car. We can also get very precise numbers for emissions of coal power plants, which can be combined with again exact numbers for EV range per kWh. We also need to adjust that with the efficiency of charging the battery, where significant loses do occur, but let's say we take a rather optimistic 15% as our number. We won't add losses on the grid to that because some minimal quantity of fuel itself is spent on refining and distribution of diesel fuel as well. So a relatively simple calculation, not much room for speculation.

Now on the subjects of this comparison. One one hand we have a new diesel car on the other an EV. Why we don't compare gasoline? Cause diesel is more efficient and also other emissions have been brought close to zero lately. Why we don't compare an average car, why take a new one. Because we are taking a standpoint of a buyer looking at the market at this point. If he is considering to buy an EV the only real alternative would be a new, modern, top of the line diesel car. She/he won't buy some hypothetical average car, they will buy this modern new one. And lastly, why use a coal power plant as the energy source in the equation?  Because they are the least efficient source still around and they are the variable in the equation. More efficient sources are used to their current full potential, unlike coal which is used to fill the gap.  As we proceed to switch to EVs in larger numbers we will be increasing electric energy demands considerably. This will inevitably increase or at least prolong the usage of coals. If we want to move away from coal, we need to save electricity, not consume more. 

So, the calculation! A 2019 VW Passat emits between 109  and 151 g of CO2 per driven km, depending on the model. Let's take a front wheel drive 2.0 TDI which emits 117 g/km as our choice. On the other hand we take a Tesla Model 3 which uses 16 kWh per 100 km driven, regardless of the variant more or less.  When we multiply that by the amount of CO2 that a coal power plant emits, which would be around 0.9 kg per kWh produced and 1.06 per kWh charged in the cars battery (+15%). If we multiply this by 16 kWh a Model 3 needs to drive 100 km and adjust it to g/km we get 169 g of CO2 per km. This is a whole 44% more that the diesel Passat - it's not even close.

And the moral of this story? Look at the big picture. If you want to help the planet, don't think buying an EV is automatically the best thing you can do. Consider the energy source! If your country or region is still using coal, try to save electricity, don't double your usage by buying an EV cause you will only make things worse.  Once the last coal plant shuts down, calculate again based on natural gas and make your decision then.CO2 emissions - EV vs modern diesel car"

* **D** post a message that he will plant 5 trees in Norway for 10 dollars
* **E** send 10 dollars to **D** 
* **D** accomplish an action, film the confirmation &amp; share GPS location of those trees
* **E** is notified about the status of his contribution and can visit one day those trees

0,"Hey, my name is Rose, I produce techno records and recently released a new EP with a track named: ""Running around in circles"". When I was a kid I was always amazed by orangutans in my local zoo.  When I became older and visited Indonesia when I was 21 I was very concerned about all this beautiful rain Forrest getting destroyed because of the human need for all kinds of products. Since I'm really concerned with global warming and think about solutions very often, I find that the deforestation is once of the biggest catalyzers since the burning puts C02 in the air while the trees are actually the natural cleaners of C02. This makes this problem twice as big. Because this concerns me so much and I want other people to be more aware of this too I decided to devote the video to raise awareness.  In my opinion, we should look at the root of the cause which is mainly the demand for palm oil. The big demand for palm oil should be reduced. Although I also wonder if a substitution will be harm-free, maybe you guys can tell me solutions on this. 

Since I think music can deliver a powerful message I asked a talented film producer from Indonesia to make a video showing the impact of deforestation. The budget was only 150 dollar and still, he did an amazing job showing what the big demand for palm oil does to his country. 

I want to donate all revenue which the track generates with it streams to an NGO that focusses on the prevention of deforestation and demand for palm oil.

0,"Horrified by the Madrid Failure, I asked a friend in gov policy what one can do to move the needle on climate action. I’ll bet lots of people feel like they’re doing everything right in their personal lives—cycling, recycling, etc—but still feel so powerless to fight climate change. 

Here’s what my friend had to say:

“Yes, Madrid failed. Yes, unprecedented coordinated international action is needed to meet the IPCC targets. Yes, that is unlikely to come in time to prevent global geography from changing dramatically in our lifetime as a result of climate change. And yes, humans are terrible at future-planning.

In terms of policy/politics advice, social media doesn't matter unless you have the reach of Cambridge Analytica or a Russian troll. Mass petitions usually just get a form response written by an intern. An exception is petitions submitted formally to Parliament, In Canada, if you get 25 signatures on paper (or 500 online) any MP can submit the petition and the government has to respond. In the UK the threshold for a government response is 10,000 signatures on an e-petition, but if you get 100,000 it will (almost certainly) be debated in Parliament. I don't know about the US.

*Letters matter. MPs actually decide to do things based on letters. Everyone sends emails so they're noticed less. If someone sends a letter, they're old and/or they really care. (Old people get political attention. In some respects, young people could benefit from taking a page out of old peoples' book. Their paper book.) Also, politicians have fax machines that nobody uses, so when a fax comes through everyone notices.*

All of the things you do make a difference. But they make more of a difference if you help people with power to make their own choices on similar grounds. And the more directly you can reach them the better.Act like a Boomer for climate action—send a letter/fax to your gov representative!"

I found this article and video very useful and interesting to eliminate plastic completely from our planet. Everyone should must have a look on this and follow these measures to solve this problem.

 once again big oil rears its ugly head..  

My question.. carbon scrubbing?? Can we burn the plastic as a fuel source ? I guess the bigger question is.. can we burn our trash and do it in a clean manner?  If we didnt have to pay to ship it over sea? Those big ships burn dirty fuel as well to get it there.. really dirty.. 3 big container ships dump more carbon into our atmosphere than all the cars in North America!!..Burn baby burn"

The basic google search I already did. By that I mean I search for ways you could reduce your pollution footprint, some basic concepts of what we could do.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I want to ask if you could help me start understanding good habits to better optimise environment human impact. 

Is there sites with daily tips and methods, things that we could use instead of x or y behaviours?

Like places to get more informed about certain materials/products across all fields that we should avoid.

I am from Brazil, and I would like to share with you a song by a countryman, which has a very nice and beautiful passage that talks about the environment, the planet Earth and us human beings. The song is called ""Sal da Terra"", by singer Beto Guedes. The passage I refer to is: ""Terra!/És o mais bonito dos planetas/Tão te maltratando por dinheiro/Tu que és a nave nossa irmã."" Whose translation (according to Google Translator) would be: ""Earth!/You are the most beautiful of the planets/So mistreating you for money/You who are our sister's ship""

According to research published earlier this year by Gregory N. Bratman, et al; the environment can have a direct interaction with our mental health. It's effects can range from simply improving your mood to having a grounding effect that boosts your focus and attention. While the exact magnitude of what level of interaction equals to what level effect in a person is still undetermined, the study concluded that nature and an interaction with it as small as being near a tree in a city (cataloged as an ""urban green"" experience in the study) can fulfill a beneficial impact on the human psyche. A take away from the study is that ""\[Diverse shareholders\] including city planners, landscape architects, engineers, parks departments, developers, infrastructure providers, health professionals, community-based organizations, and environmental advocates, could use a tool that helps them anticipate the mental health impacts of decisions they make relating to the environment."" Meaning that cities can and should be designed with a connection to nature in mind to maintain our basic requirement for natural stimulation. However, this raises a question about our current climate crisis not often addressed by politics, which is, how will our collapsing ecosystem come to effect human mentality? When we no longer have access to forests, fields, or clean bodies of water, will the impact go beyond the death of our planet, to effect all of us at a deep psychological level?

What do you think? I am open for discussion!Did you know that the environment can directly impact your mental health?"

I'm on a school working with the MYP system(maybe it is familiar to some). In the third year we have this thing called a community project where we have to do something for a community or a cause. We have chosen to do a fundraiser for the kilimanjaro area. They plant trees to help the nature and at the same time create jobs for the locals in poverty. The good thing is that they don't just plant trees but also take care of them till they will survive by them selves. The effects are already seen, ne nature is becoming more stable. The top three donators will receive a price made by the locals!

Our GoFundMe has already raised over €430 I will be adding a link at the end, any help is appreciated (one tree= €5)

We also made a website that will give more information on the project, the cause and our self, the website also contains a link to the GoFundMe

0," I live in NSW, Australia. We are on fire, and have been for weeks.

Today has been covered in smoke cloud. You can see it, and it wasn't just an early morning thing. It looks like 70s celluloid film of a wartime movie: hazy burnt orange, making any green look khaki. I look out at the late afternoon sun, and it's red. Not nice autumn orange, though we have just entered summer, it's *red* in a field of haze. It has been for days. The afternoon sunshine is bright orange on those days where the smoke haze isn't too thick for the sun to get through.

Today was 39 degrees Celsius. The winds have picked up. The firefighters have been at it for over a month. Over two million hectares of forest and bush has been burnt - there isn't much green left on our map. Huge portions of it are now soot black. You look at where the fires are, and the markers of them on the map overlap like you're looking at a field of wildflowers in blue, yellow, and red. People have lost their lives. People have lost their homes. The devastation of wildlife is huge.

Sydney has just been put on a hosepipe ban. I watered my plants with reserve water from the shower. My one cat has asthma. I've been making sure to close us in tightly on smoke days and give her her preventer puffer every day. Otherwise she has an attack when she gets up to do anything at all. It's week three of this.

We are in drought. Again. And it looks worse this time. There are parts of NSW where the dams are empty. Truly empty. Dust fields that are massive, nothing able to grow in these conditions.

The sirens are heard from my house going by time and time again - loud and multiple as I try to get to sleep. People who have it worse than my cat and can't breathe. I drive home and see firetrucks up by people's houses. I pull aside for ambulances racing to help people who rely on clean air a bit more than the rest of us do.

It's two weeks to Christmas, and we look outside to see something apocalyptic rising with the sun. Places I've been - places I know well - sit facing fires approaching them from all sides. ""I wish you all the luck in the world"" is what I can say to those I know facing it, and what I get back is ""We will stand and defend our home.""

These aren't small fires that burn out in days. These are firegrounds larger than Sydney itself that have been burning for weeks. The hot air rises from them, along with the ash, and it meets the damp winds off the ocean. The result is a thunderstorm.

You'd think rain would put these fires out. It does not. The ground and combustibles on it is so dry a deluge does little to nothing. The fires keep raging, even as water, unable to be absorbed by a ground too parched to take it, floods away from them. We get floods on top of fires. Sooty water running away from a blaze that won't stop blazing.

These thunderstorms are unlike any I have ever seen before. People say thunderstorms bring a false twilight. This is a very late twilight - nautical twilight, perhaps. Early afternoon becomes just before full dark with a rapidity that is both blustering and daunting. And it's a while yet before the rain falls, though you can hear the thunderclaps and see the lightning these ash-ridden clouds create well before you know the loud pattering of raindrops and hailstones. You just hope one of these lightning strikes doesn't happen nearby.

Because these thunderstorms start new fires. They put nothing out, while, at the same time, bring more fire; more destruction.

I've sat on tenterhooks, waiting to hear whether I'm needed to help evacuate people. I've watched places I know well go up in smoke. I've waded through that smoke haze, feeling like I have a constant burgeoning cold, trying to carry on with daily life when it feels like the place I live, where my loved ones live, is to be short lived.

And then there are the arsonists. I'm at a point where I'd wish the harshest of punishments on anyone who, in whatever fit of stupidity they were suffering, did the malicious act of lighting another of these damned fires. More water that we don't have spent on fighting them. Planes and helicopters flying overhead trying to stop the intractable and progressive wall of huge orange flames before more people, more homes, and more wildlife are destroyed. All because of some absolute wanker who thought it'd be ""funny"" or ""cool"".

Outside my window is sepia tones. It isn't usually. Usually it's blue, and an Australian green; and the grey of tarmac and the brown of bricks. It seems all is bathed in that burnt orange; we're all feeling it, some more than others.

I look at Wollemi National Park on Wikipedia. Only home to a species of tree they thought was extinct on the mainland. Home to Aboriginal heritage sites. Home to a great many things. An amazing space of wilderness, it tells you, so worthy of preserving. Not a word about the fact that it is black.

Never before in my life have I been so tempted to edit a Wikipedia article as I was just to add the salient point: ""*it's on fire""*. There's little of it left. I tried to edit it. I had the sources I was going to cite with me. I don't understand internet code well enough to do that without my contribution accidentally wiping out, as the fires are doing, the words that that article contains about how worth preserving the national park is.

""Climate change?"" they say. ""What climate change?""

I looked at Cape Town, South Africa and thought, ""Thank the fates we have it okay here!""

Now I look outside and wonder how long it's all going to last. It's hard not to be fatalistic when you're living in a place that's giving you every bloody indication you, your species, and all you care for is inhospitable here. That all the fucking around we've been doing has just been begging for this to happen.Climate change is unimportant, is it? I live in NSW Australia. I feel every day like I'm living in an apocalypse film."
0,"The nene goose, the Hawaiʻi state bird, [has officially been downlisted](https://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2019/12/08/video-nene-downlisted-from-endangered-to-threatened/) from endangered to threatened under the ESA.  Another story on the same topic wrote:

&gt;Even with the news of the population recovery, nene still have a long way to go before their population is fully recovered.

Full recovery means the species *could* be hunted, as far as federal law is concerned.  That would not be accepted in Hawaii, which essentially made the same statement in 2012 when [a proposal to delist the green sea turtle](https://www.environment-hawaii.org/?p=544) arose.  From the article:

&gt;more than 100,000 people had signed petitions...(opposing) the delisting...the National Marine Fisheries Service, whose proposed delisting of the turtle prompted the outpouring of support, is not supposed to be guided by public opinion. Rather, the determination it makes is to be based on the best science available.

Well it looks like public opinion is demanding a *new approach* to these matters: special consideration for *special animals.*

What exactly are *special animals* and why do they have this appeal?  I won't try to answer that, but here's a short list:  green sea turtles, nene, whales, other marine mammals, America's feral horses, grizzly bears, great apes, chimpanzees.  Each animal has a large constituency that wants these animals protected from all hunting/killing, regardless of endangered species ranking, forever.

Q: Would a *Permanently Protected Species* category be of value?  

Increasingly we're seeing heated debates over delisting--the grizzly delisting debate was another one--where *Naysayers* with animal love or animal welfare orientations are using scientific challenges that take up inordinate time of the USFS and other federal agencies involved with administering the ESA.   

Should we just give into the notion that some species should be protected for sentimental reasons?Should America have a new animal protection category, ""Permanently Protected Species,"" separate from endangered species status?"

Change protein was founded on the belief that we can make our customers healthier while allowing them to save the world. Simple, right?  


By using plant proteins in our products we can create a product that is still crammed full of protein and nutrients but uses a fraction of greenhouse gasses to create when compared to whey. Oh and the taste is impressive too!  


Plant proteins are also incredible for your body. They are proven to increase blood flow to your muscles by reducing inflammation and blood viscosity meaning that your muscles get the nutrients they crave, faster. Plant proteins are also shown to both increase energy levels and increase muscle efficiency by up to 18%. This means that you’ll have the grit to power through/conquer your workout and outperform your peers.  


I have almost always felt helpless in the face of climate change. It was always too big an issue to deal with and I thought that someone else would take care of it.  


However, after several decades of feeling helpless, I decided to do something about it and that’s when Change Protein was born.  


“The world is changing and I want to be part of that. I want everyone to be part of that”  


I have a vision to change the way that we consume protein so that in the future we have a minimal impact on the environment. There’s something very satisfying about that, right?. The world is changing and I want to be part of that. I want everyone to be part of that and you can too by making small changes in your life.  


Making changes doesn’t need to be complex, it can be as simple as changing how much animal products you consume to reduce Co2 emissions or as simple as walking somewhere rather than driving.  


That is the ethos of change protein: to make changes simple and improve the world we live in.

0,"Here's a news piece from the 31 January 2019 Nature magazine word for word:

&gt;Per capita carbon emissions must fall to 1955 levels  
&gt;  
&gt;Gregg Marland, Tom Oda &amp; Thomas A. Boden  
&gt;  
&gt;**The findings of the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report imply that we need to reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide within 12 years to where they were 41 years ago, to avoid a 1.5 °C increase in average Earth surface temperature.** Global emissions and concentrations are still rising, however, so temperatures continue to go up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our estimates show that emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement manufacture in 2017 surpassed 10 gigatonnes of carbon (see [go.nature.com/2teyafi](http://go.nature.com/2teyafi)). Population growth is partly responsible. In 1977, when the global population was 4.23 billion, emissions per capita were 1.19 tonnes of carbon per person. By 2017, this had increased to 1.34 tonnes (the global population that year was 7.55 billion). **So, decreasing total emissions to the 1977 figure will mean returning per capita emissions to those recorded for 1955.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Growth in industrialization and population distributions also increase carbon emissions. Emissions are still high from countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany, which industrialized early. Top emitters now also include China, India, Iran, Brazil and South Africa. The distribution within countries is also changing as urbanization and transportation increase (see [go.nature.com/2hwpia3](http://go.nature.com/2hwpia3)).  
&gt;  
&gt;We need to make drastic changes in carbon emissions, soon. This means widespread global cooperation and unprecedented commitment.

My first thought to this is ""that is obviously never going to happen"", but I'd rather keep up delusional hope than be that harsh. But it's hard to understand and properly put to words how incredibly, extremely challenging that will be.Avoiding 1.5°C increase in global temperatures seems extremely difficult, if not impossible."

0,"By request of many people in the past few months, such as:

- You need serious help, here the number to the suicide hotline

I decided to take up the offer and seek help! And was it interesting!

I called and spoke with the operator, who asked me what was going on. I explained to her in short:

‘I was browsing the sub reddit, and I made a comment on a Greta post and people said I needed to call you guys and that y’all could help me’

She responded ‘hold one moment and I’ll get you to the correct department one moment’

I waited about ten minutes since they were high call volumes. It routed me to my home state emergency crisis line.

The kind lady (named Susan) asked me what the problem was.

I explained (in better detail this time) that I was browsing the sub and saw a meme. The meme was a clown with balloons(no, this is not made up) and the next slide shows Greta sati ‘are those plastic?’ In which case the clown goes and hides. Signifying Greta’s power as a environmentalist. I explained how I commented and said ‘Greta is wearing a plastic raincoat in the slide’. I was met with a response telling me to call the suicide hotline and to get help!

Susan, then asked me if I have had thoughts of suicide in the past. I said no. She asked if I feel the urge to harm other people or myself. I said no.

She then mentioned ‘isn’t Greta a little girl?’ 

I said ‘yes, but my comment wasn’t mean towards her’
 
I then explained a simple relation;

‘If I tell someone using gasoline is bad, but then use gasoline myself, and that person notices and says ‘hey, you’re burning gasoline, too!’ 

‘Is that bullying?’

‘No, that is not bullying’

‘Is it bullying to tell people they are candidates for suicide and need to get help immediately?’

‘Yes, there is something seriously wrong with telling people that in a situation that you described. It is never ok to tell someone they need to commit suicide, either’

She then had some basic questions about myself. She asked me if I want her to set up an appointment for me.

I said, ‘if you feel that I need further assistance, I will gladly take your advice. But it as a professional, if you think I’ll be okay I won’t go any further’I called the suicide prevention hotline."

I choose to talk here to because I am really concerned by the way we humans are dealing with nature in general.

It has been years that I study how we can make the things better, with less harm and more harmony.

To me, one of the most important point, and one the most evaded, is how we manage our markets through currencies.

The huge majority of the money created today comes from debt and creates and maintains an artifical unbalanced situation that leads to hyper growth not indexed on real human needs but on financial debtical needs.

There is an alternative that started two years and a half ago in France, an experiment that could completely change the way we manage our exchanges and markets.

I made a post on it: [https://www.reddit.com/user/boudleo/comments/e759w0/money\_debt\_overproduction\_a\_new\_currency\_to\_try/](https://www.reddit.com/user/boudleo/comments/e759w0/money_debt_overproduction_a_new_currency_to_try/)

It is quite long but I'd really be glad if some people around here could take the time to reach for the information.

I honestly think that if people around the globe appropriate this new type of currency, it could teally change something.

This is a sort a democratic currency, debt-free, co-created by members.

Have a good read and feel free to comment if you want to discuss about that subject.

American Universities generate large amounts of waste annually and much of the material recycled ends up ruined due to improper materials being recycled alongside them. My colleagues and I at the College of Charleston believe that much of this is due to improper signage at waste receptacle locations and we are offering a free sample of signs to test out at your local universities. Experimenting with the variety of signages linked below will hopefully result in a lower amount fo improperly disposed of waste on the campus. Any results you may find would be greatly welcomed.

**Odds, Consensus, and Irreversibility**

[https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831)

“We estimate odds ([Table 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831#t1)) of no more than 1-in-1,000,000 that the 2014 temperature record would have arisen from natural \[variability\] alone for both NH and the globe. That conclusion also holds for the other record years 1998, 2005, and 2010. Allowing for all of the potential variants in dataset and methodology ([Supplementary Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831#s1)), that conclusion remains true for 2014, but the odds are somewhat higher for 1998 in particular (as high as 1-in-50,000 for NH and 1-17,000 for globe).”

[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002)

“The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook *et al* (*Environ. Res. Lett*. [**8** **024024**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024)) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (*N* = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 *Environ. Res. Lett.*[**11** **048001**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001)) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.”

“This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450–600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the ‘dust bowl’ era and inexorable sea level rise.”

This frequency of local extinctions was broadly similar across climatic zones, clades, and habitats but was significantly higher in tropical species than in temperate species (55% versus 39%), in animals than in plants (50% versus 39%), and in freshwater habitats relative to terrestrial and marine habitats (74% versus 46% versus 51%). Overall, these results suggest that local extinctions related to climate change are already widespread, even though levels of climate change so far are modest relative to those predicted in the next 100 years. These extinctions will presumably become much more prevalent as global warming increases further by roughly 2-fold to 5-fold over the coming decades.”

“Here, I use these data to show that recent local extinctions related to climate change have already occurred in hundreds of species around the world. Specifically, among 976 species surveyed, local extinctions occurred in 47%. These extinctions are common across climatic zones, habitats, and groups of organisms but are especially common in tropical regions (which contain most of Earth’s species), in animals (relative to plants), and in freshwater habitats. In summary, this study reveals local extinctions in hundreds of species related to the limited global warming that has already occurred. These extinctions will almost certainly increase as global climate continues to warm in the coming decades.”

“Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.”

“Climate change is causing mismatches in food supplies, snow cover and other factors that could severely impact successful migration and reproduction of avian populations unless they are able to adjust to new conditions. Resident (non-migratory) birds also face challenges if precipitation and/or temperature patterns vary in ways that result in mismatches of food and breeding. Predictions that many existing climates will disappear and novel climates will appear in the future suggest that communities will be dramatically restructured by extinctions and changes in range distributions.”

“According to information reported by employers to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 0.2% of ‘mass’ layoffs – layoffs of 50 or more workers – are caused by government intervention or regulations (of any kind, not just environmental regulations). / For every job lost due to regulations, 15 are lost due to “cost cutting” and 30 are lost due to “organizational changes” (e.g., change in ownership).”

“Finally, when looking at the total effect of environmental regulations on the economy, the effect is overwhelmingly positive. According to the Office of Management and Budget, cost benefit calculations for all major regulations between 2005 and 2014 showed economic benefits that dramatically exceeded costs, every single year. / The benefits of environmental regulations have exceeded costs by a ratio of more than 10:1 / All told, major regulations provide net economic benefits to the U.S. of over $500 billion per year… / In the case of fuel efficiency standards, net job creation was estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, with five jobs created for every job lost… / For every dollar invested, wind and solar projects create twice as many jobs as fossil fuel projects. / Wind and solar generate almost five many times more jobs, per Gigawatt-hour of electricity generation, than fossil fuels.”

“A 2014 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that stronger environmental policies lead to short-term gains in productivity growth, resulting in permanently higher levels of productivity.”

“New research shows that if present trends continue, the total cost of global warming will be as high as 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Four global warming impacts alone—hurricane damage, real estate losses, energy costs, and water costs—will come with a price tag of 1.8 percent of U.S. GDP, or almost $1.9 trillion annually (in today’s dollars) by 2100.”

[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/cost\_of\_delaying\_action.pdf](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/cost_of_delaying_action.pdf)

“Based on a leading aggregate damage estimate in the climate economics literature, a delay that results in warming of 3° Celsius above preindustrial levels, instead of 2°, could increase economic damages by approximately 0.9 percent of global output. To put this percentage in perspective, 0.9 percent of estimated 2014 U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately $150 billion. The incremental cost of an additional degree of warming beyond 3° Celsius would be even greater. Moreover, these costs are not onetime, but are rather incurred year after year because of the permanent damage caused by increased climate change resulting from the delay. / An analysis of research on the cost of delay for hitting a specified climate target (typically, a given concentration of greenhouse gases) suggests that net mitigation costs increase, on average, by approximately 40 percent for each decade of delay. These costs are higher for more aggressive climate goals: each year of delay means more CO2 emissions, so it becomes increasingly difficult, or even infeasible, to hit a climate target that is likely to yield only moderate temperature increases.”

“In the Energy Modeling Forum simulations in Clarke et al. (2009), the median additional cost (global present value) for a 20-year delay is estimated to be $0.7 trillion for 650 ppm CO2e but a substantially greater $4.7 trillion for 550 ppm CO2e. Many of the models in these studies suggest that delay causes a target of 450 ppm CO2e to be much more costly to achieve, or possibly even infeasible.”

“From initial glacier volumes and extents (Eq. 8), the mean projected changes in total ice volume at 2050 are −39.3 and −52.4 % for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively (Table 6). The minimum projected volume change at 2050 is −26 % (cold/wet), and the maximum is −70 % (warm/dry). At 2100 the projected mean total volume loss is estimated at −83.7 % for RCP4.5 scenarios, and −94.7 % for RCP8.5, with a range between −70 and −99 %. Radic et al. ´ (2014) and Marzeion et al. (2012), respectively, estimate mean glacier volume changes in south-east Asia of −50 and −60 % for RCP4.5 scenarios and −75 and −70 % for RCP8.5 by 2100. In all scenarios presented here, the rate of ice loss decreases towards the end of the simulation period (Fig. 16), which indicates a shift towards equilibrium mass balance conditions. / Increased precipitation may slow the rate of future mass loss, but it is not sufficient to offset the increases in glacier melt due to increased temperatures.”

“Our results suggest that the risk of self-amplified forest loss is reduced with increasing heterogeneity in the response of forest patches to reduced rainfall. Under dry-season Amazonian rainfall reductions, comparable to Last Glacial Maximum conditions, additional forest loss due to self-amplified effects occurs in 10–13% of the Amazon basin. Although our findings do not indicate that the projected rainfall changes for the end of the twenty-first century will lead to complete Amazon dieback, they suggest that frequent extreme drought events have the potential to destabilize large parts of the Amazon forest.”

“Greenland Ice Sheet - Warming over the ice sheet accelerates ice loss from outlet glaciers and lowers ice altitude at the periphery, which further increases surface temperature and ablation. The exact tipping point for disintegration of the ice sheet is unknown, since current models cannot capture the observed dynamic deglaciation processes accurately. But in a worst case scenario local warming of more than three degrees Celsius could cause the ice sheet to disappear within 300 years. This would result in a rise of sea level of up to seven meters.

Arctic sea-ice - As sea-ice melts, it exposes a much darker ocean surface, which absorbs more radiation than white sea-ice so that the warming is amplified. This causes more rapid melting in summer and decreases ice formation in winter. Over the last 16 years ice cover during summer declined markedly. The critical threshold global mean warming may be between 0.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, but could already have been passed. One model shows a nonlinear transition to a potential new stable state with no arctic sea-ice during summer within a few decades…

West Antarctic Ice Sheet - Recent gravity measurements suggest that the ice sheet is losing mass. Since most of the ice sheet is grounded below sea level the intrusion of ocean water could destabilize it. The tipping point could be reached with a local warming of five to eight degrees Celsius in summer. A worst case scenario shows the ice sheet could collapse within 300 years, possibly raising sea level by as much as five meters.

Boreal forest - The northern forests exhibit a complex interplay between tree physiology, permafrost and fire. A global mean warming of three to five degrees Celsius could lead to large-scale dieback of the boreal forests within 50 years. Under climate change the trees would be exposed to increasing water stress and peak summer heat and would be more vulnerable to diseases. Temperate tree species will remain excluded due to frost damage in still very cold winters.

Amazon rainforest - Global warming and deforestation will probably reduce rainfall in the region by up to 30 percent. Lengthening of the dry season, and increases in summer temperatures would make it difficult for the forest to re-establish. Models project dieback of the Amazon rainforest to occur under three to four degrees Celsius global warming within fifty years. Even land-use change alone could potentially bring forest cover to a critical threshold.”

“Climate change has resulted in significant changes in weather pattern, precipitation distribution, temperature and moisture fluctuation, soil erosion, and desertification (FAO [2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR28)), although the average annual environmental measurements may not change significantly. Extreme conditions caused by these changes bring about many unexpected and more frequent biotic and abiotic stresses (Bebber et al. [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR7); Trenberth et al. [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR89)). To feed increasing world population, total crop production will need to be significantly increased with less arable land under much severe environmental conditions (Tilman et al. [2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR88)). For the past 50 years, such demanding has been met by continuous yield improvement. Unfortunately, yield growth has been slowing, rather than increasing as required by global population increase. For example, annual yield growth for three major cereals, rice, wheat and maize, has been decreased to 0.79–1.74 % for 1990–2010 from 2.19–2.95 % for 1960–1990. Moreover, if such reduction tendency continues, yield growth for 2010–2050 will decrease to 0.62–1.33 % (FAO [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR29); Pardey et al. [2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799247/#CR66)).

“Climate sensitivity of ecosystems—derived by fitting response functions to all locations in a given Koeppen climate group across 58 climate projections—varies strongly across climate zones (figure [3](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034036/meta;jsessionid=4A7D162B6CBA7BAD242A1C9A73B030A6.ip-10-40-1-105#erl398458fig3)): cold climate ecosystems show a high sensitivity to temperature changes but a low sensitivity to precipitation changes, whereas dryland ecosystems show opposite sensitivities. In temperate and tropical ecosystems the sensitivity to changes in precipitation depends on temperature change: strong warming increases the sensitivity to declining precipitation.”

“Efforts to understand the influence of historical global warming on individual extreme climate events have increased over the past decade. However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at &gt;80% of the available observational area.”

“Regardless of the ultimate cause for the observed relative stability in Δ*F*CO2,sol over the last 420 million years, business-as-usual emission scenarios (for example, representative concentration pathway RCP8.5)[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref39) for fossil fuel emissions suggest that atmospheric CO2 could peak in 2,250 AD at ∼2,000 p.p.m. CO2 values as high as this were last seen in the Triassic around 220–200 Myrs ago ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4)). However, because of the steady increase in solar output over time, in terms of radiative forcing by the end of this century RCP8.5 is similar to the early Eocene, and by 2,250 AD exceeds what is recorded in the geological record for at least 99.9% of the last 420 Myrs ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4)). A recent study suggested that if both conventional and non-conventional fossil fuel reserves (amounting to ∼12,000 Pg C; ref. [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref40)) were exhausted in such a business-as-usual scenario, atmospheric CO2 could rise to ∼5,000 p.p.m. by 2,400 AD (refs [41](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref41), [42](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#ref42)), which is clearly higher, in terms of both forcing and absolute CO2, than at any time captured by our compilation ([Figs 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f3) and [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845#f4), Wink12K scenario). Such a scenario therefore risks subjecting the Earth to a climate forcing that has no apparent geological precedent, for at least the last 420 Myrs.”

“Based on measurements of gases trapped in biogenic and abiogenic calcite, the release of methane (of ∼3–14% of total C stored) from permafrost and shelf sediment methane hydrate is deemed the ultimate source and cause for the dramatic life-changing global warming (GMAT &gt; 34 °C) and oceanic negative-carbon isotope excursion observed at the end Permian. Global warming triggered by the massive release of carbon dioxide may be catastrophic, but the release of methane from hydrate may be apocalyptic. The end Permian holds an important lesson for humanity regarding the issue it faces today with greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and climate change.”

The Earth’s supply of fossil fuels was formed from remains of organisms that died hundreds of millions of years ago. In a sense, then, fossil fuels represent stores of the sun’s energy from the distant past. Because these resources are being used at a much higher rate than they are replenished, researchers are exploring methods of capitalizing on the photosynthetic process to provide alternative fuels

The power of sunlight can be tapped to generate a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. Species of unicellular algae that are prolific producers of plant oils can be cultured in long, transparent tanks called photobioreactors, such as the one shown in the photo at Arizona State University. A simple chemical process can yield “biodiesel,” which can be mixed with gasoline or used alone to power vehicles.Algae: An Alternative Source Of Fuel"

They claim renewables alone can only power very sunny ( australia, spain, texas), or coastal nations with a lot of tidal activity (norway). They claim in order to save the planet and reduce co2 we need to go back to a more primitive less energy demanding society. What do y’all think of this? Is this corret or are they wrong? If they are wrong can you provide links. 

This person also argues that:
1) there isn’t enouht lythium on the planet to replace every gas car with electric
2) mining lythium and manufacturing batteries for e-cars  is emitting a lot of co2 and pollution and requires fossil fuels to power, that is damaging to the envoirment 
3) renewables cant provide enough electricity to charge all f.ex european cars so the chargers will probably be powered by coal if everyone will switch to electric cars
4) europe is causing minimal contribution to the global emissions and europe becoming carbon neutral would make little to no difference to stop global warming with countries like china continuing to pollute

My roommate and I are having a disagreement on the best way to recycle. Currently, he does not rinse out most of his plastic containers that he sends to the recycle; or, if he does they are not rinsed out all the way. He explained that the energy required to ""warm"" the rinse water in the sink, and the water itself used to rinse the item out does not outweigh the benefit of the material saved.

My question, is there an equilibrium for water saved and material saved? Is it better to fully rinse out an item, or use a little less water? My thinking is its better to clean out the material fully, so more of the material is saved.

He also argues that many places are not actually recycling the recyclables, as the market is currently not great for it. Still, we might as well try recycling, right?

0,"I’m writing an essay about how electric cars are providing a way to reduce the amount of pollution we emit into the air. My essay is more focused on how companies are involved in helping improve the environment, but I have a question relating to coal power and I am hoping someone here may know were I can find information that will help my paper.

As I understand it. The idea is that if we replace cars that use gas with EVs, that should reduce the output of toxins into the air. However, this would mean that electricity outputs could do up as people have to charge their cars. Right now, a large portion (the majority if I’m correct) of electricity comes from coal sources power plants.

If we get our power from coal, then that would mean we would still be (until these plants were replaced or retrofitted) using coal and other fuels that still emit Co2 and toxins.

My question is do we know if this just means we are moving the source of toxins, and not really reducing the output? I am sure it’s logical to assume that even if the plants used more fuel that it would be offset by the reduction of cars, but how much of a reduction and is it enough to say it’s worth the cost of moving to a new power source?

I’m not asking to say we shouldn’t be trying to find cleaner ways. I believe that even if I fully doubted climate change that innovation is a good thing and we have reason enough to move past coal. I also believe that if I am going to make the argument that things like electric vehicles are going to happen, I need to make the argument knowing what people might counter with, and I have face this argument that we are still dependent on coal and it doesn’t solve anything.

Any help or explains would be great. If there is another forum or area that this question would be better suited for please let me know.Question about coal consumption and electric cars. Looking for information."

“The air that Americans breathe isn’t equal,” *USA Today* says in its [report](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/03/11/air-pollution-inequality-minorities-breathe-air-polluted-whites/3130783002/) on the study.

“Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately breathe air that’s been polluted by non-Hispanic whites, according to a study,” *USA Today* says. “This new research quantifies for the first time the racial gap between who causes air pollution – and who breathes it.”

The[ study](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/03/05/1818859116) is available online, including a portion entitled “significance.”

&gt;Racial–ethnic disparities in pollution exposure and in consumption of goods and services in the United States are well documented. Some may find it intuitive that, on average, black and Hispanic minorities bear a disproportionate burden from the air pollution caused mainly by non-Hispanic whites, but this effect has not previously been directly established, let alone quantified. Our “pollution inequity” metric is generalizable to other pollution types and provides a simple and intuitive way of expressing a disparity between the pollution that people cause and the pollution to which they are exposed. Our results are timely, given public debate on issues relating to race, equity, and the regulation of pollution.

*USA Today* reports that 100,000 Americans die from pollution a year, more “than car crashes and murders combined,” although the exact causes of death and how it relates to pollution are not explained.

“Even though minorities are contributing less to the overall problem of air pollution, they are affected by it more,” Jason Hill, an engineering professor at the University of Minnesota and co-author of the study says in the *USA Today* report, which notes that he is white.

“Is it fair (that) I create more pollution and somebody else is disproportionately affected by it?” Hill says.

“What is especially surprising is just how large pollution inequity is and has been for well over a decade,” Hill says.

The type of pollution analyzed in the study is PM 2.5 — grains of particulate matter that are smaller than the width of a human hair, according to *USA Today*. They are present in car exhaust, from power plants, and burning materials.

0,"Dear Reddit, 

I addressed the following letter to EPA Region 5 Director, Mr. Ken McQueen, but thought that it would also be good to spark some conversation here. Let's talk! What are you thoughts/opinions on this topic? 

&gt;I am writing to you today in great concern regarding the state of our national environmental affairs. Upon my initial review of the EPA’s FY 2018-2022 U.S. EPA Strategic Plan, I felt the agency was headed in the right direction towards fulfilling their mission to protect human health and the environment. However, subsequent revisions and rereads of the document have me concerned that the EPA’s actions (or lack thereof) may be putting human health and the environment at further risk. I am writing to you today in hopes of voicing the concerns of not only U.S. citizens, but also the global community.  
&gt;  
&gt;The greatest impediment for the EPA’s mission statement has been the conflict of interest shared among the officials at the agency and Trump administration. In recent years, this has been showcased by: (1) the hiring of officials \[at the EPA\] with a long known history and ties in petroleum and coal industries (who fail to strike a balance between independent and societal goals) (2) the absence of any mention towards energy or petroleum in the FY 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, and (3) anti-competitive actions taken by the EPA in the energy transition. I find these acts to not only be inappropriate but also a threat to our national security.   
&gt;  
&gt;The EPA’s decision to not act against the Trump Administration rolling back regulations that limit industry emissions has been a blatant attack on the \[green\] energy transition and national security of the United States. Our dependence on fossil fuels for economic and energy stability is the biggest threat we must face with an ambitious energy transition. According to the EIA, of the 101.3 quadrillion Btu consumed in the USA in 2018, 36.9 quadrillion Btu were sourced from petroleum and a further 44.2 Btu from other fossil fuels. Additionally, according to data provided by the United Nations Statistical Division, petroleum accounted for 9.4% of U.S. exports and 8.6% of U.S. imports. This dependency means that any threat to our petroleum supplies would be destructive and have us relive events such as the 1973 oil crisis or put us back in another war for oil. For the energy market, rolling back industry regulations is anti-competitive and conducive to the market growth of renewable energy sector.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also feel the need to reiterate the fact that this energy transition, if sustained and not faced with anti-competitive actions, will improve grid efficiency, reduce air/water/ground pollution, help to securely lay the path for future power generation, and improve the quality of life of the average American (all things outlined in the EPA’s FY 2018-2022 U.S. EPA Strategic Plan).  
&gt;  
&gt;This, along with other factors, brings me to question the true interests of the EPA and their mission statement. By choosing to actively censor scientific information about climate change, preventing states from enforcing higher air quality standards, illegally withdrawing Clean Water Act protections, and failing to protect public/private lands from disastrous drilling operations, my dreams to one day work for the EPA have been challenged. Does this agency truly represent the core American values it claims to? Does this agency exist to serve the American people or a just a select few of rapacious stakeholders? If it does exist to serve core American values and people, why do their actions speak otherwise?A Letter to EPA Region 5 Director | Let's Talk!"

0,"If you’re not aware already. Parts of Australia are facing the worst drought in centuries. And it seems likely that long term there may be little chance of reliable rainfall ever returning so farmers can grow pastures for cows, sheep and other livestock.
But I was talking to some mates at the pub and I ran an idea past them: why not we organise to buy up some unviable farm land and plant hardy tree and bush species which are fire tolerant and can survive the almost permanent drought conditions in many parts!
I was thinking it would repurpose the farms to something good for the environment. Becoming a carbon sink, returning native animal habitats and perhaps even returning the land to the original owners, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia!
If anyone thinks this is a good idea and has tips on how to make it a reality please let me know! I want dreams to become reality and to help the planet :)
One idea I had was to pool resources and find a place somewhere where we could dry seed the place with quick growing hardy varieties of  casuarinas, acacias (wattles), and maybe even have some space for some more ‘commercial’ crop experiments like agave for ‘tequila’ (noting you can’t call it that if it isn’t from regions in Jalisco, Mexico and a few other areas in Mexico).Idea to reimagine drought affected farms to help the planet and get carbon credits"

**I support the earth** 💪

As we know the time to act is now. But action isn't easy especially for individuals. Today it's our turn to save this nature, to give it back the protection that it had always provided us with.

Truly, the Global Warming is Happening and We are the Primary Cause. 

So how can we face it ? I think the next step we should take as individuals is to spread the idea of standing beside the earth, the nature. We should show the whole world that we are supporting our Mother 'nature' and we will do whatever it takes to save it!

0,"I was wondering the following things, appreciate if somebody here has some information: (Sorry if these things were asked before)

1) Is there scientific data that can show an increase in wildfire frequency over the last years? Something similar to the clear depiction of the increase in athmosperic CO2 concentration or increase in average temperature.
(It is maybe not trivial to define a good measure for wildfires)

2) How big is the feedback effect that wildfires have in terms of CO2 emissions? I mean, the wood gets burned which releases CO2, but as many have pointed out: this, together with the regrowth of plants is a natural and often even necessary process. But on the long run, can we say that a forrest that burns down more often does capture less CO2 in its trees over time because they are on average smaller?

3) If this effect exists, did the well known climate models incorporate it? I mean I have often heard of the viscious cycle when melting permafrost releases methane and other such cycles. But have not yet heard about such considerations with wildfires.

4) Similar question: Did they also consider wildfires when calculating the damage that must be expected? So far I have mostly read about drought (which I consider much worse than the rise in sea level) but wouldnt wildfires increase the damage to nature and agriculture even more?

I am asking all of these because I am just surprised how the rise of reported wildfires seems much faster than other effects, and I wonder if this will continue. Or if maybe it is really mostly an increase in public/media awareness (thus the first question).Some questions about the recent wildfires."

I firmly believe that we should only use non-renewable resources when required. I understand that for some needs we have to use the likes of plastic but for others that are more related to style, it is entirely possible to avoid using non-renewable materials and rather use Wood. Since Antiquity, forms of art and decorations have been shaped in wood, stone and metals, why do we bother use plastic when we are able to achieve the same result without damaging the environment?

0,"This is an issue that I've seen way too often on this subreddit. 

Climate change is a huge issue. It threatens biodiversity, the safety of coastal settlements, and most of the ocean as we know it. Climate change does not, however, threaten humanity as a whole.  The human race is not going to go extinct. 

Stop touting the concept that if we don't act on climate change, we're all going to die. It's uneducated and deligitimizes the green movement as a whole. 

Rising sea levels are not going to kill us, we can migrate or build sea walls. Fewer species is not going to kill us, we just might have to survive off of different foods than normal. The death of coral reefs is not going to kill us. 

The only effect of climate change that threatens us is the reduced production of oxygen which, is being solved as we speak. Sinuous honestly think that any government is going to watch humanity suffocate? We can plant more trees is Northern areas; we can produce our own oxygen. It will be more monetarily expensive, but not the end of the world. 

Climate change has real, extremely important impacts. The oceans are being bleached, the forests are being burned, and biodiversity is being destroyed before our eyes. These issues should be enough to convince anybody to act on climate change. They are why climate change needs to be stopped. 

Stop touting false information. Saying that humanitybis going to die from climate change is patently false. It's a scare tactic. It's propoganda. You don't need lies to support your argument when the facts are on your side. By spreading these lies, you make our whole argument seem peas trustworthy. You give power and credence to climate deniers/skeptics.

0,"Being green isn’t the only reason for companies to get on board. Retailers that find ways to minimize food surpluses will reap financial rewards too.

**Grocery retails of the future need to embrace innovation, and be agile with the implementation of it.** The grocery retail is a low-margin business facing disruption from the likes of [Amazon](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/amazon-to-open-its-first-non-whole-foods-grocery-store-in-2020/amp/). Sure, some of the grocers have launched their own [innovation labs/hubs](https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/h-e-b-build-new-tech-innovation-lab), but the retail industry has now morphed into the tech industry, and it's now a race!

With 50% of consumers complaining that grocery stores haven’t figured out how to use technology like other retailers, according to a survey by [Phononic](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180220005044/en/Phononic-Survey-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Preferences-Grocery-%E2%80%9CStore), grocers around the world should be looking for ways to introduce cutting-edge technology and unconventional ways to improve consumer journey to purchase.

[Wasteless](http://www.wasteless.com/), is doing just that; reducing food waste and saving consumers money, with the help of AI. 

The startup created a turnkey, SaaS software solution, for supermarkets, to manage their stocks, and reduce food prices, as shelf life dwindles. The process inspires customers to take part in the war against food waste, while at the same time enjoying better prices, and an overall shopping experience.

Wasteless AI software allows customers to choose between the nearing expiration or fresher food, at different prices. If you are going to eat or cook the item today or tomorrow, why does it matter if it expires in 3 days or 10 days? And why shouldn't the price reflect this in realtime for a better shopping experience?

![video](bacw314e4iz31 ""Most uneaten food ends up in the dump. When food waste decomposes in a landfill without oxygen, this creates an anaerobic sequence that produces the methane, which is approximately 20 times more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.  This in turn contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer, which can lead to higher temperatures around the globe."")

**Consumers are craving something different.** There are many reasons that consumers care about wasted food. Some prioritize the issue because of their feelings about health and the environment, and others just don’t like throwing money away. But concern about waste is everywhere. 

[**According to market research firm Nielsen:**](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/more-than-half-of-consumers-would-pay-more-for-sustainable-products-designed-to-be-reused-or-recycled-accenture-survey-finds.htm)

* 83% of consumes thought it was important for companies to have environmental programs.

[**According to CSB’s data:**](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/NYU%20Stern%20CSB%20Sustainable%20Share%20Index%E2%84%A2%202019.pdf)

* Sustainability-marketed products outperformed their conventional counterparts.

By implementing Wasteless end-to-end solution, one Italian retailer [cut down waste levels by half, and increased product margins by 1.2 percentage points, boosting their brand image and keeping freshness at the optimal level.](https://www.wasteless.com/Bs.WebApp.Models.SuccessStories/1/document.pdf)

Whether it’s through use of technology or finding creative ways to lure more shoppers to their store, it’s worth investing in solutions focused on food-waste reduction, and there is every reason to feed this ambition.How one startup is solving for food waste in grocery stores!"

Our professor goes on rants all the time in class about how we're destroying the planet and what we should do to help, etc. He's super passionate about nature and the environment. Today he was teaching us about the effects of farming and agriculture and brought up the scenario of the entire world going vegetarian/vegan. 

I think he said that a huge chunk (I think he said half) the land we use for farming could potentially be used for planting trees/restoring some nature. He was also talking about the gasses the meat industry uses, etc. He added that this could potentially fix just about every problem we're having with the environment. He did add though that there is pretty much a 0% chance of that happening. I know for SURE he's right about that. 

Any opinions on his opinion? I'm curious about what other people may have to say. I may not have paraphrased what he said very well so if people find something odd about all this it might be my fault for not retaining correctly what he said.Professor brought up interesting point about vegetarianism in class today"

**Advantages:** 

* The chemicals in road salt are harmful for the environment and cause cars to rust. 
* Bags of sand would be significantly cheaper than road salt (cheapest salt is $5 that I found, cheapest sand is a little less than $4). 
* Prevents black ice?

**Disadvantages:**

* The mess/trying to clean up the sand 
* Snow doesn't get melted with sand, could lead to more mess/packed in snow on the roads?

0,"A stratospheric warming event is set to start over Siberia in about 10 days. This is an event where temperatures rise in the top and medium levels of the stratosphere (25-45km altitude). This warming weakens the stratospheric polar vortex, which drives the circumpolar jet stream, and if weakened or even collapsed by the warming, it can significantly change the weather pattern across the northern hemisphere. If you happen to live in Europe or North America, and you love winter, then this is an event ordered for you. It is proven that major stratospheric warming events raise pressure over the north pole, which means that the cold polar air can escape the polar circle more easily, going south into Europe or the United States.

Climate change awareness struggles against corporate-influenced media or bought-out politicians, and I believe a strong counter is simply delivering the correct information - by hand - to a person's doorstep. This project involves building a community of volunteers, who handwrite letters addressed to the residents in their suburb (handwriting just the intro, not the whole thing). It's personal, not disruptive, not controversial, but high impact and gives a concerned individual a chance to facilitate awareness in their local area.

I'm excited and have a lot of ideas to implement. However, I'm only one person. I recognize the value of listening to a community, so I offer anyone - if interested - to offer critique/suggestions/advice towards this project.

It's a bid of a morbid thought, but is it healthy for the earth to balance the amount of births/deaths in such a way? If we get to the point where most of the deaths on the earth are from old age or accidents then the number of births per day outweighs is significantly and the population will grow exponentially. 

Of course it is easy to write this from a first world point of view, but we all sympathize for third world countries and hope everyone can one day live equally, but can our planet even support such an ecosystem where everyone has such a share of resources? For instance water, where the heck are 7.7b people going to get an equal share of water from?

Curious to hear other people's thoughts on this.

0,"So, we all came across a number of photos, videos, and articles that state **Amazon Rainforest** produces 20% of the planet’s oxygen. Right? But what if I say, this is a pure misconception?

Well,  I am a curious soul so I decided to take a look and do my part of  research regarding this claimed number. I watched more than 30 videos,  read 15+ articles, few research papers, listened to 2-3 podcasts and  collected 15 pages of data, from which, this blog is developed. (hard  work, eh)

I want you guys to clear the clouds of this  misinformation which is hovering over your head. Amazon rainforest has  nothing to do with the world’s oxygen but it is indeed as cardinal as  oxygen. Having said that, it is ironical to see that one of nature’s  species (humans) is destroying it for its endless greed.

**In  this blog, you will not only read about the original oxygen percentage  but will also know, how the amazon rainforest holds the rich array of  life that exists on earth and what vital role does it play to keep our  planet healthy.**

## First, let’s know a little about Amazon Rainforest –

Amazon  Jungle is the world’s largest tropical rainforest stretched out in  about 5.5 million square kilometers, an area half the size of Europe.  And yes, Brazil is home to more than half of the amazon rainforest. The  amazon has been there for at least 55 million years.

Amazon  Rainforest wakes up regularly with more than 1300 bird species, 3000  types of fishes, 2.5 million distinct insects and approx. 430 species of  mammals. According to WWF, **“Amazon has more types of ants on one tree than some entire countries.”** Interesting! Isn’t it?

It’s  believed about three million different species of plants and animals – 1  out of 10 species in the world – live in the Amazon. Out of which, one  is the [amazon river dolphin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_river_dolphin). This fascinating creature is famed for the pinkish color it acquires as it gets older, from which came its name **‘Pink Dolphin’.**

##### Now, it’s time to reveal the truth behind the oxygen theory.

Well, I am sure you have read about photosynthesis and respiration when you were in high school. Still, let’s recap a little.

As  mentioned in LiveScience, “Photosynthesis takes in the carbon dioxide  produced by all breathing organisms and reintroduces oxygen into the  atmosphere. While during respiration at night, plants consume more than  half of the oxygen they produced during the day.” **In the case of the Amazon rainforest, trees breath in more than half of the oxygen they produce.**

As  told by Scott Denning, Professor of atmospheric science, Colorado State  University, “Trees constantly shed dead leaves, twigs, roots and other  litter, which feeds a rich ecosystem of organisms, mostly insects and  microbes. The microbes consume the remaining oxygen in that process.  Forest plants produce lots of oxygen, and forest microbes consume a lot  of oxygen. **As a result, net production of oxygen by forests – and indeed, all land plants – is very close to zero.”**

As  the biochemist, Nick Lane mentioned in his book ‘Oxygen’, “Even the  foolhardiest destruction of world forests could hardly dint our oxygen  supply.”

I hope you got the point and understood that Amazon  Rainforest has nothing to do with the world’s oxygen but again, it  doesn’t mean we can afford losing Amazon Rainforest. We seriously can’t!  And you will know why, in the coming content.

**Now the question is – From where does the planet secure its oxygen?**  Well, most of the oxygen source is the ocean and not the forests. The  oxygen we intake is the upshot of marine plants such as phytoplankton  which includes algae, cyanobacteria, and kelp, which brings life to the  atmosphere.

**And about the title ‘Lungs of the Planet’.**  As we all know, the lungs purify the air, so does the amazon. It  filters the air we breathe. Hence, the Amazon rainforest is the world’s  largest ‘air purifier’ and that’s the reason it is called ‘Lungs of the  Planet’.

## Let’s know more about Amazon Rainforest –

&amp;#x200B;

* **Food and other products–**

Close  to 80% of the food we eat, actually comes from rainforests. For example  Coffee, Chocolate, rice, tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, corn, black  pepper, pineapples etcetera. **And around 30,000 fruits can be found in rainforests.**

But  they also offer a vast variety of products that many of us use on a  daily basis. Tropical forest oils, gums, and resins are used in  insecticides, rubber products, fuel, paint, varnish, and wood finishing  products. And tropical oils are key ingredients in cosmetics, soaps,  shampoos, perfumes, disinfectants, and detergents.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Medicinal Value –**

Amazon  Rainforest is indeed ‘The World’s Largest Medicine Center’. It is home  to more than 40,000 plant species and around 25% of all drugs are  derived from rainforest plants.”

From the Cinchona tree which is  used in developing medicine for malaria to the Lapacho tree that helps  in cancer, the Amazon rainforest is filled with remedies. **In fact, the medicinal discovery in rainforests has just begun and has a long way to go.**

Scientists  say, “Less than one percent of all the species have been properly  examined for medical potential.” They use different snake venoms, molds,  plants and flowers which can only be found in Amazon Rainforest; hence  it acts as a medical lab for a number of deadly diseases.

Moreover,  Scientists also believe that somewhere in the Amazon forest lies the  antidote for cancer and some more incurable diseases. **That’s just one of the many reasons why we can’t afford losing the Amazon rainforest.**

Just so you know, Amazon is one of the greatest libraries of nature on earth.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Rainfall –**

According  to the WWF Panda organization, “Every year, Amazon receives torrential  rainfall between 1500mm to 3000mm. Eastern trade winds that blow from  the Atlantic Ocean account for about half of the rainfall, with the  other half due to evapotranspiration (the process by which water is  transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil  and by transpiration from plants).”

**A single tree can  transpire more than 200 gallons (760 liters) of water, per year, and  once that water is back in the atmosphere, it falls again.**  Without the Amazon rainforest, there won’t be sufficient rainfall even  in the close regions. Rainfall needs rainforest as much as rainforest  needs rainfall.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Importance of Trees –**

Forests  cover about 31% of the planet and they play an essential role in  supporting life on earth. Deforestation is stripping the earth’s forest  with a monstrous pace. With the current rate of destruction, the world’s  rainforest could completely vanish in the next 100 years.

The  estimated number of trees in the Amazon rainforest is around 400 billion  that belong to more than 16,000 different species and these 400 billion  trees store 2 to 3 billion tons of carbon dioxide. **Trees act as  a shield against further climate change by absorbing C02 from the  atmosphere that inflames global warming, which is a pretty big deal.**

**The world is already on the verge of death but the rainforests like amazon are keeping it alive. Let’s save it!**

Do you remember the good old days when you thought recycling was good?

That was before you leaned your e-waste and plastic weren't recycled at all, it was shipped to Asia.

Of course the poisoning of your food doesn't start with plastic waste. Your food is contained by plastic leaching into it before you eat it. In the old days, our grandparents were poisoned by lead from canned food. Nowadays we're poisoned by the thin film of plastic that lines the can. That poison is screwing up your endocrine system. Your endocrine is what makes you male or female. The male sex is being assaulted from all sides chemically. Everything from pesticides to PFAS are destroying all vertebrate males. This may not seem important to you, but the effects of this poisoning are transgenerationally epigenetic, meaning this will affect your kids and grand kids. The effects are also cumulative, unstoppable and irreversible with continued exposure. The good news is that this plastic and chemical poisoning is killing our sperm, so you are very unlikely to actually produce offspring, which is good during a time of civilizational collapse. The people of northern Europe burn their plastic for electricity, along with waste paper products and trees. They call this green energy, because you get paid green bucks for burning green trees. Burning palm oil in cars is also called green energy because Nords are self-deceitful. Nords think they are green because they ship all their plastic and e-waste to Asia.

Reducing the carbon footprint of the meat industry, and decreasing meat consumption is required to partially mitigate climate change. Climate change is the global impact of rapid heating of the earth’s atmosphere caused by human activity. Meat is an important part of people’s diet, but overconsumption of low-cost meats and the way they are produced is environmentally unsound. The meat industry harms the environment; however, those environmental costs are not included in what people pay for it. As the global population grows, so does the demand for more meat at a low price (UNEP, 2012). A side product of industrial animal agricultural is high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHGs absorb and trap heat in the atmosphere in molecular bonds. An anthropogenic accumulation of these gases has increased the global temperature, which has resulted in ocean levels rising, irregular storm patterns, unpredictable outbreaks of animal-vectored diseases, and the degradation of habitat due to wide climate fluctuations. 



While there are many sources of GHG emission, meat consumption and its emissions can readily be reduced. 10 percent of Canada’s GHG emissions are directly related to agriculture, and half of those emissions are from meat production  
 (Wickramasinghe, 2013). This varies 

between 15-20 percent among developed  
 countries (Wickramasinghe, 2013).  
 Worldwide, humans consume much more  
 meat than we need in our diet. According  
 to an article published by Jennie  
 Macdiarmid (Macdiarmid, 2013), the average person consumes more than double the meat recommended in a healthy balanced diet (See figure 2). The most effective way of reducing the GHG emissions related to meat production is, therefore, to decrease the amount of meat consumed. Although vegetarianism is most effective; radical alteration of diet is unrealistic, and positive effects could result from a slight decrease in individual meat consumption. There are also several key adaptations that would reduce emissions related to animal agriculture. The major contributors to GHG emissions from meat production are transportation, digestive gas produced by cattle, and deforestation. As well as diverging personal consumption to avoid beef and other red meats. 

The transportation of agricultural products makes up 9 percent of all vehicles on the road (EPA, 2018). In the production of meat; grain is brought to a livestock farm, live stock is brought to a slaughter house, meat is brought to factories or to stores, and cars bring food from stores to 

  

Figure 2. Representation of a heathy diet (Wickramasinghe, 2013) 

  

houses. This can be seen in the systems diagram I have created (Figure 3). While the meat industry requires multiple stages of transportation (e.g. from grain farm to meat farm to slaughter house), less fuel is spent on the direct transport of grain to distribution locations. 

 

Figure 3. Systems diagram of the transportation of products throughout the meat industry. 

This has the potential in local situations to lessen the fuel consumption by calories. While not many cows can fit into a truck, enough grain can to completely fill the truck from floor to roof. To reduce the emissions in transportation, a switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles would be in order. Although it is not yet available to the public, an alternative for heavy load transport is becoming available. This year, Tesla CEO Elon musk unveiled his new project; the tesla Semi, a fully electric 18-wheeler truck designed to carry heavy loads. One utilized in large scale industry, 

  

this truck could be an alternative to heavy  
 load livestock carrying vehicles (Torque,  
 2018). While this does not only involve the  
 meat industry; CO2 emissions from  
 transportation can be decreased by simply  
 decreasing the distance food has to travel  
 before it ends up in our local stores. This can  
 be decreased by shopping locally.  
 Transportation makes up 11 percent of GHG emissions from the global food industry, 7 percent of these can be prevented by shopping locally (See figure 4) (TerraPass, 2018). Transportation is broken down into two sections, supply chain transport, which is the distribution of food throughout the world or a country, and final delivery transport, which is the transportation of food from distribution areas (e.g. markets, grocery stores) to homes. Supply chain transport accounts for 7 percent of total GHG emissions in the global food industry, while final delivery only accounts for the final 4 percent (TerraPass, 2018). This means by localizing your food (includes meat), you are skipping the distribution stage, and instead receiving meat locally. 

Since the meat industry deals with living organisms, waste is inevitable. The average beef cow produces 908 kg of manure a year (Ferguson, 2018). Accounting for all mature cows in Canada, a collective 3.36x109 kg of manure are put into the environment a year (Statista, 2018). Has a costly impact on the environment as it contributes to the levels of Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere. However nitrous oxide is not the only problem. Methane is released by cows as 

 

Figure 4. Emissions breakdown (TerraPass, 2018) 

  

passing gas through the mouth and anus. In the news, people often hear CO2; the worst GHG, but little do we hear about methane,  
 which is produced in vast quantities by  
 livestock. According to scientist Sam 

Lemonick, methane is “85 more  
 effective at trapping heat” in our  
 atmosphere than CO2 (Lemonick,  
 2017). Methane is a natural product of  
 a cow’s digestive system. It is produced  
 in the gut (Lemonick, 2017) by special microbes called methanogens. It plays an important role in the fermentation of nutrients traveling thought the digestive tract (Lemonick, 2017). Historically, this posed no threat to the environment, however since the vast breading of livestock for cheap commercial purposes, populations have grown and so has methane emissions. In Canada alone, there are 3.71 million beef cows (Statista, 2018), each producing 100kg (Skeptical, 2015) of methane a year. Recent research done at the University of California studies the effects of a partial seaweed diet on the methane producing microbes in a cow digestive system. The research found that a partial seaweed diet (1% seaweed), implemented into a cows regular feed, results in a decrease in the individuals methane emissions by half (Kennedy, 2018). According to professor Ermias Kebreab, “the seaweed can inhibit an enzyme that's involved in producing methane in a cow's gut” (Kennedy, 2018). This process, if integrated into our cattle industry, can cut methane emissions in Canada by half. 

 

Figure 5. Methane Emissions from 75’ to 2015 (Skeptical, 2015) 

  

To run a successful farm you need water, food, and most of all lots and lots of space. Continuously with more farms switching to ethical free-range practices, farms are requiring more space for the cattle to roam.  
 While I support ethical  
 practices in the meat industry,  
 this correlates to further  
 deforestation to increase the  
 grazing area. In the 1990s, the  
 world forests shrank by 94,000  
 (FAO, 2015) square km to make room for cattle farming, and only cattle. All species in the kingdom plantae use CO2 in the process of making energy known as photosynthesis. What most don’t know is the sheer extent to how much plants absorb globally of CO2 a year. According to an article written by Peter Reich, the forests of the world sequester “around 4 billion tonnes of carbon per year” (PhysOrg, 2013), this is “equivalent to almost 60% of emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement production combined” (PhysOrg, 2013). Since CO2 is a GHG, reducing its presence in the atmosphere result in slowing down global warming. To minimalize deforestation, the crops/livestock with the largest yield of calories in an acre are used to maximize the use of a plot of land. In one acre of land, enough cows to supply 1.1 million calories of beef could be farmed. In the same plot (1 acre) you could instead grow 17.8 million calories of potatoes, or 17x more energy than could be harnessed from 1 acre of beef.  
 Many large-scale changes must be made to mitigate the global rise in temperature. However small-scale changes to individual diets have a huge effect on our personal contributions to the 

 

Figure 6. Calories per acre of land use. Information gathered from (Anna, 2014) 

  

fight against climate change. Overtime, a simple choice to reduce certain meats from your diet you make a prodigious difference. According to an article of Green Eatz (GreenEatz, 2018) outlining the equivalent GHG emissions per kilo gram of meat produce, lamb and beef are the highest emitters at 39.2 and 27 kilogram of emissions per kilogram of meat. The meats with the lowest emissions are chicken and fish, giving off 6.9 and 6.1 kilograms respectively (GreenEatz, 2018). This proves that better choice for a meat diet would be to primarily consume chicken and fish, however these do not fall in the same ball park as fruits and nuts, which emit 1.1 and 2.3 kilograms (GreenEatz, 2018) respectively, per kilogram produced. In terms of the highest collective emissions, beef it the main culprit. Individually, cows are responsible for less general GHG emissions than lambs, however are more commercialized and abundant in population. According to an article on The Guardian (Carrington, 2014) written by Damian Carrington, by giving up a portion of the meat in your diet, you are doing more for the environment in terms of reducing GHG emissions than giving up driving your car. 

In the words of David Attenborough, lifelong environmentalist and scientist, “The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now” (McGrath, 2018). Climate change isn’t a localized event, it’s global. For action to be taken, we need the powerhouses of the modern world to make immediate and radical changes. Along with this we need to average person to make a difference in their own lives. This can be done by choosing your meats, cutting back, and localizing your shopping. Other changes like must be done to alter our otherwise inevitable radical climate change, such as reducing transportation, preventing deforestation by the implementation of dense crops (potatoes), and 

  

swaying the market away from beef. To follow these requirements would help the world come one step further towards the mitigation of climate change.

Some of the 4th generation or later reactor designs that are being researched and developed are supposed to be far more resilient and safe to operate, and more importantly, can reuse nuclear waste as a fuel source, reducing the need to ""store"" such waste from thousands of years to say, several hundred years.  In this light, it would actually be astonishingly irresponsible from an environmental standpoint NOT to employ advanced nuclear reactors for power.  It is another non carbon emitting tool in the power generation toolbox, and we can reduce the current waste half life of much of the waste that is just sitting around.

That waste is not going anywhere, so why not have it neutralized on the scale of hundreds of years instead of thousands?  What possible argument is there against this?  Even if renewables are cheaper, we should still develop nuclear further to clear out the current waste.  And of course still advance fusion.  Long term, I do not just want civilization to rely on renewables for solar exploration.  What if we wanted a Mars base or a base farther out where solar was less salient?

Before I changed my workplace, I rideshared with a colleague. Now I don't, and despite searching among colleagues and contacts I can't find a suitable person to share my ride. Searching the internet and appstore showed promising solutions, none of which helped me find a match.

Not to be deterred, I looked into the matter to see if I could solve my own problem. I listed the major hinderances I and other commuters have regarding ridesharing: not finding a match, fear of strangers, risk of getting stranded at work, uncomfortable discussions about cost-sharing, etc. Then I put my brain into high gear and found believable solutions to all of them. What I came up with was a non-profit organisation which will have a website (geared toward employers and community partners) along with apps (android and IOS) for people wanting to rideshare.

My next step was to start learning java programming, which proved impractical. Ridesharing needs a solution now, not in 3-5 years when I've learned enough to do what I need.

That brings me to the present. I am looking for people with programming experience to both donate advice and programing expertise in order to execute my plan -- to build an app-based network of ridesharers which really delivers an alternative to driving alone to work.

**Aside from the lack of traffic safety, Meteorological influence is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents.**  


**These are weather accidents.** 

***“A weather accident is an accident that occurs in any adverse conditions such as sleet, snow, rain, fog, wind or on slick pavement.”***  


**More accidents occur when the roads are wet following a rainstorm than in any other type of bad weather. Here’s a list of some of the bad road or weather conditions which can lead to accidents:**

### Strong Winds and Hail

**Strong winds, hail, and other such strong convective weather have a more significant impact on traffic. The wind area is proportional to the square of the wind speed. So, when the wind hits the body-wide side, the force is the largest. The wind can cause severe damage to buildings, traffic facilities, and so on. When the wind overturns the motor vehicle, the ability of the car to drive is weakened. The situation worsens if the wind is accompanied by rain.**

### Snow and Ice

**Frost and snow on the road due to extremely low temperatures directly affect the contact of vehicles with the road surface. Ice/snow/frost on the road severely reduces the friction coefficient of the road, so when the driver applies the brake, the tyre surface loses contact with the road surface and the vehicle skids.**

### Low Road visibility

**Dicey weather conditions like mist, fog, snow, heavy rain, or too bright sunlight may affect the driver’s visibility on the road. Road visibility impacts traffic safety, especially on highway traffic safety. The poor road visibility often leads to highway congestion which can interrupt traffic and transportation, even blocking the whole route. According to statistics, traffic accidents caused by the influence of dense fog on the expressway account for about 1/4 of the total number of accidents. In 2018, 18 vehicles collided in a chain due to extreme fog on Yamuna Expressway, killing one.**

### Heavy Rain

**In rainy weather, the ground is slippery, and the visibility is also impacted. Many times, the road fills with rainwater. These factors can lead to route closure. This causes a huge safety hazard to traffic.**

### Extremely High Temperatures

**During summertime, the ground surface temperature can reach up to 40-45 °C in India. Such high temperatures can heat the tyres, and in certain situations, the tyres may flatten down or burst up. This causes the driver to lose control of the vehicle and result in an accident.**  


**Poor weather is a natural phenomenon that we cannot avoid. What can be done as a preventive response, is to alert people on the roads about the extreme or worsening weather conditions. But how can the drivers be warned of real-time weather and road conditions?**

### Welcome Automatic Weather Station (AWS)

&gt;***“The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) as a meteorological station at which observations are made and transmitted automatically (WMO, 1992a).”***  


**An Automatic Weather Station (AWS) is a facility that transmits and records the observations collected from different meteorological measuring instruments. These AWS can collect data from the location, which can then be processed and analyzed locally at the AWS or the central server of the network.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e2za53v3g2y31.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd5034195bbba35396f45e6ea05ba728f79a2f9b

**An AWS is a unique and highly comprehensive system strategically located alongside the highways to provide detailed information about the weather and the road conditions. It has robust hardware equipment for data acquisition and cutting-edge software for weather data analytics, providing inputs for the forecasting models.** 

### How does an Automatic Weather Station Work?

* **The AWS consists of several parts:**
* **Data Logger – to record data**
* **Sensors – to measure required parameters**
* **Meteorological Mast – the pole to mount the AWS**
* **Other Accessories**

**The main objective of an** [**Online Weather Monitoring System**](https://oizom.com/product/weathercom-automatic-weather-station/) **dedicated to road safety is to continuously analyze the climatic and road conditions to contribute to Traffic Management System and accident reduction and prevention. For this, the system design takes full consideration of all the local climate characteristics and meteorological requirements. The software architecture uses C/S and B/S, GIS (Geographic Information System) to build an early warning system.**  


**AWS are data collection nodes of both weather and road conditions. Once data is collected, it is transmitted via cloud to the central server where it is processed through robust analytics systems and rendered into useful visualizations.**

**So, let’s see how an AWS can help in** [**reducing Vehicular Pollution Exposure &amp; Road Accidents:**](https://oizom.com/usecase/road-safety-outdoor-air-quality-monitor/)

#### Weather and Road Monitoring

**First things first, an AWS collects all prime weather parameters like air temperature, ambient pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, road visibility, road surface temperature, road conditions (ice, snow, wet, dry), freezing point, rainfall, flood, light intensity, and UV radiation.**   


**Monitoring and measuring these parameters can help in assessing the driving situations round the year. Consequently, the data can be used to create data inventory and archival for setting driving limits for every season. AWS improves the timeliness of maintenance and its efficiency, along with minimizing the travellers’ exposure to dangerous weather and roadway conditions.**

#### Notifications and Alerts to Drivers

**AWS data can be transmitted to the drivers via the cloud as alerts or notifications. The AWS can be integrated either on the driver’s phone or car display to push timely notifications. These data can also be published on roadside displays for public dissemination of data. Data can help in arriving at a threshold limit using suitable algorithms.** 

**For example, based on the data, the system can recommend a speed limit to the drivers in highly windy situations. At high speed, the chances of accidents increase as the wind can easily knock down the vehicle. By alerting the driver to reduce his speed, the accident probability is mitigated, as the driver can easily control the car. The system data can also facilitate the users in multiple ways such as sending notification about the air pollution data caused by the vehicle.**

#### ITMS Integration

**Weather stations can be integrated into an existing ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System), which can help in monitoring the traffic pattern of the region. Using the data, the authorities can layout and implement an efficient traffic management system to bring down vehicle emission and ambient pollution levels.**

#### Future Prediction and Forecast

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t5bucvz7g2y31.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd51045202b1a0da31952350800dc3c1b24b32e7

**Weather forecasting and prediction are possible through historical data and trend analysis, which can aid in timely warning/alert broadcasting. The patterns and trends can help in identifying incoming hazards, such as cyclones, hurricanes, floods, drought, etc., especially in hazard-prone areas. Weather forecast can help in the preventive treatment of roads for ice/snow formation or providing early warning on possible fog formation. Early climatic assessment can save significant loss, both financial and human life.**

### Advantages of Automatic Weather Stations

#### Real-Time Data Propagation

**AWS can propagate hyper-local meteorological parameters to the travellers and authorities in real-time, which can help to make on-time decisions in case of any natural hazard. The actual values of the parameters can be provided every 2-30 minutes for continuous and up-to-date data for road safety.**

#### Intelligent Data Communication

**The AWS uses an intelligent communication server. It can utilize GPRS, GSM, WiFi, Ethernet, LoRA, NB-IoT, Sigfox, LTE, Modbus, and many such communication protocols for data transmission. Its low power consumption, long-range data communication enables monitoring even in remote areas. It has the characteristics of high integration, strong function, and strong anti-interference ability.**

#### Solar-powered Functioning

**Automatic Weather stations can run on solar power, meaning it does not consume significant energy while preventing accidents. This feature greatly reduces the damage caused by the induced current caused by lightning to the acquisition system and the sensor.**

#### Low Maintenance

**Robust and weatherproof design enables an AWS to function even at extreme hot, cold, windy, dusty conditions. Though the sensors require periodic calibration, the overall maintenance is quite cost-effective.**

**Hence, the combined system of road video surveillance, traffic flow monitoring, and automatic weather station information will form a “smart transportation network.”**  


**Automatic weather stations can also be integrated as a part of other environment or pollution measuring devices in combination with the data-acquisition and processing units. Such a combined system of equipment, interfaces, and processing units is called an Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) or Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).**

### What’s the Future for Road Safety Like?

**Government departments can use AWS information. It will help them take appropriate action in case of low visibility and fog. They can warn drivers about fog conditions to prevent road accidents.**  


**The future roads will generate an unparalleled amount of hyperlocal weather and road data which can be used to prepare a model for the best and safest road systems. The fatal road accidents can be prevented from occurring using road data and its trends. Real-time data can help in assessing where and how traffic congestion and accidents happen, allowing the authorities to manage them accordingly. Vehicle manufacturers will also be able to use the data in designing safer vehicles that can communicate with the roads and other cars.**

My name is Ajeet, I'm a student at Wilfrid Laurier and a member of EarthSuds, a Canadian social enterprise.

I was shocked to learn (you might be too) that **750 million toiletry bottles are sent to landfills every year.** Those mini shampoo, conditioner, and body wash bottles we all use can't be recycled, so they are sorted out of recycling and sent to the landfill.

That's why my colleagues and I created EarthSuds. We've created **solid dissolvable tablets of shampoo, body wash and conditioner, that dissolve upon contact with water.** They're made from all natural ingredients and are vegan and sulfate-free.

&amp;#x200B;

**International Don't Google Anything Day!**

So, I was trying to work out what could potentially be done to help continue to raise awareness of both our energy use (and demands) and the impact they're having on the environment, I was Googling a few bits and pieces and wondered how much power it took to run a Google search.

There isn't recent data, but the last available data (from 2009) placed this at 0.3Wh or enough to run a 10 Watt bulb for 108 seconds - on modern terms, that is a 5w (50w equivalent) LED bulb for **216 seconds**. 

Google offsets its energy use with a purchase of the equivalent amount of renewable energy to achieve 'net zero operational emissions' but that doesn't address the question of Energy Need and the amount of 'home power' required to make these searches.

So what, if for one day...maybe a Sunday when people aren't at their desks, we all just didn't Google/Bing/whatever anything for a day (Ecosia plants trees for their searches so maybe they get dispensation)? 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of internet users (c. 3.05bn) in the world,  hitting even a fraction of them would result in considerable energy savings: 

If 1 million people worldwide decided to not google anything **ONCE**, the power saved would be more than **8 years** **constant** use of a room-lighting LED bulb. For argument's sake, let's say a bulb is used on average 4 hours a day, in real terms it means that bulb could run for 48 years.

Pros and Cons of [Outsourcing Mobile App Development](https://www.cypressoft.com/post/outsource-mobile-application-development)

**1. Mobile App Outsourcing is Cost-effective**

As it is said, outsourcing is money saving. Reasonable cost is one of the most critical factors and advantages of hiring an offshore application development team. Currently, businesses can easily find professionals at an effective cost, who can support in providing a high-quality IT product. Outsourcing reduces the total development costs, and in such cases, it’s possible to save money on atop costs and spend lower prices on offshore labor.

On the other hand, if you have an in-house team, you offer a monthly salary regardless of the workload. However, outsourcing gives an opportunity to hire a team for a single project. 

**2. Time-saving**

Being first in the market may greatly influence the competition. When offshore companies work 24/7 to deliver the software product within the deadlines set in advance, the development process takes less time. 

**3. Additional Experience**

Very often, an in-house team may lack the specific knowledge and experience to deliver the required solutions, and as a business, you have to spend time looking for additional talents who should be trained to suit your project needs. The mobile application outsourcing brings extra experience and knowledge to achieve business objectives.

**4. Wide Choice of New Talents**

While outsourcing development, businesses deal with a larger market for IT companies. They have a wide choice to select the best app development company in the extensive pool of talents. As a result, there is an advantage to choose the company experienced in your business field.

You may learn about the experience sphere of the company by checking their portfolio. There you get familiar with the various business solutions the agency has provided in different industries.

**5. Business Value**

The companies that rely on outsourcing have staff overloaded with work. The outsourcing services can help to take care of the overall programming processes and highlight the main functions. An offshore agency takes all the hard work of development, and you save time to focus on other higher tasks, including marketing, demands, content, and other additional services. Outsourcing helps you get more free time, and you can take into consideration other essential functions and be more active in other areas of business scope.Outsource Mobile Application Development"

**When: Tuesday, November 12, 3pm ET**

A new report released by Climate XChange offers a carbon pricing policy framework that contextualizes the potential role it can play in a just transition to a regenerative, sustainable, and equitable economy. If carbon pricing is to be a central component of climate policy moving forward, it must not only reduce GHG emissions, but also embrace deep overlapping connections with major social and environmental justice issues of our time.

So how exactly can carbon pricing programs improve public health, sustainable development, economic mobility, resilience, and political self-determination in the communities that need it most?

Hear from Veronica Eady of California’s Air Resources Board (CARB), Eleanor Fort of Green for All, as well as lead author Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange on his report and what we can learn from California’s experience on cap-and-trade and environmental justice. We hope you can join us!How can carbon pricing further environmental justice?"

They're also a nutritional powerhouse. They're high in protein and are a complete protein, meaning they have all essential amino acids. Compared with nuts or beans, Crickets have more omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for your brain and lower your triglycerides. They also have essential B12, which is only found in animal products.

Some have even called them delicious, as they have a bit of an earthy, or nutty flavor mixed with a savory flavor that's vaguely meat-like.

Recently the Danish authorities have finally agreed the construction of the part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. It should run along the country’s continental shelf southeast of Bornholm on the bed of the Baltic Sea.

However, this decision may become fateful for the whole ecosystem through its irreversible environmental impact. Basically, the case is not the Nord Stream 2 itself, but the chemical munitions on the seabed along the pipe route, which may make it impossible to use the water area for fishing and recreational services.

This threat has not become a surprise for Russia which for a decade sought ways to circumvent the chemical munitions dumping sites east of Bornholm. However, the lack of verifiable information about the precise sites of chemical deposits made these attempts futile.

Hazardous waste on the seabottom includes adamsite, diphenylchloroarsine, and mustard gas, which appeared there back in Soviet times, when they were dumped in cases by ships on their way to designated area. The sea drift carried them far beyond this area which resulted in munition cases found in unexpected locations not only on the Bornholm coasts but even in Sweden. Still the location of the entire arsenal in the Baltic Sea remains unknown.

Official documents of that time stated that in 1946, four ships carrying 15.000 tonnes of dangerous cargo were sunk nearby the Bornholm coast along with 8 tonnes of chemicals dumped to the east of the island. Their dumping was complicated with the poor visibility and weather conditions which meant the chemical agents were dropped outside the designated areas.

Another source of pollution was 69.000 tonnes of shells with tabun (nerve gas) and phosgene which appeared in water of the so-called Small Belt near Bornholm after the Wermacht\\u2019s decision to dump it in 1945. The new episode of contamination was provoked by development in chemical weapons, turning them from mustard-based to those containing sarin. As a result, out of date munitions were dumped in Baltic, Kara, Okhotsk, and Barents Seas without clear indication of pollution areas.

According to the report of the Special Working Commission on Chemical Weapons Utilization of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM CHEMU) of 1994, all the attempts to take chemical weapons from the seabed are not only feasible but even dangerous and therefore unacceptable. Another document, The 2009 Nord Stream Espoo Report: Key Issue Paper Munitions: Conventional and Chemical states that the only way to dispose of the dangerous residue on the seabed is their explosion, however, the risk of contamination of far wider areas is too high as well as the threat of the rise of toxic substances into the surface layers of the sea with subsequent pollution and harm to marine organisms seems inevitable.

Moreover, that is the construction of the Nord Stream 2 that may result in violation of integrity or even detonation of the munitions, making the worst scenario possible. Though even successful construction of the Nord Stream 2 does not guarantee the further safety of its operation since vibration may cause unpredictable consequences if the pipe lies over dumping locations. By the way, the one or two molecules of mustard gas only may result in pronounces mental and physical deviations for the affected organism.

0,"In the summer of 2014, the central east coast of Florida (Space Coast &amp; Treasure Coast) experienced a persistent influx of jellyfish. As the ocean temperatures rose throughout the summer months so did the jellyfish population. As a surfer, I spend hours a day in the ocean and have been stung countless times. I would come up with theories about tidal changes and phases of the moon dictating the movement of jellyfish, but nothing really made sense.

Along with the moon jellies, the translucent tiny particles were the biggest nuisance. These particles were apparently either jelly fish larvae (sea lice) or broken up pieces of a jellyfish from rough seas. There seems to be no connection to when these random jelly blooms happen but dead zones are popping up everywhere around the world. With a continuous flow of fertilizers and other contaminants entering the ocean, it is inevitable the jellyfish will keep coming. With only two predators (turtles &amp; whales) in the ocean, there seems to be no hope for a decline in jellyfish population. Jellyfish were on this planet before us and they will be here after us.The Jellyfish Nightmare"

I have seen carbon projects before that struggled due to the legacy issues with the carbon sector , but this looks like it has addressed some of those by use of blockchain and auditability.

Wondering if anyone has seen similar ideas elsewhere (I know Australia is very active in carbon) and do people think this kind of project can get momentum and make a difference as people become more aware of their possible carbon footprint.

I think this is a bit of a gamification which I see as a good way of getting awareness and any positive news is good for the environment and even better if big chains follow  similar concepts .

The air might kill us! I said the air we breath may kill us. The other day I was driving home from work on the I- 10 I saw my city buildings swimming in smoke. The city was covered in a brown cloud of smoke. I felt a very bad feeling. We have very air quality. We might die of lung disease because the air we breath is killing us. My car is a hybrid, I wanted to save money on gas therefore I picked a gas saver. I’ve seen lots of trucks smoking. The air quality is terrible here in Phoenix AZ. The rent is cheap and there are lots of jobs for college students and recent graduates to just grab in the fastest developing city in the United States. How can we better the quality of air? We need clean air laws. With mexico being out neighbor we can not dirty their air. The companies smoking the tall tubes are burning and the smoke is killing us. This is third degree murder in my eyes. I came to this state to study. Unfortunately the companies that make billions do it at our expense. During the summer, it gets really hot making it hard to breath in 107 degrees Fahrenheit weather. The Weather Channel sends out warning of bad air quality. This is not climate change. We need new people in power that can change our laws so we can have clean air. New laws may clean up the air, but it's up to every resident in Arizona to propose and sign a new law that cleans up the air. Let’s call it the ‘clean air act.’ Everyone is mad about the world, but like John Mayer said “no one is doing anything about it” man he writes great songs. The dirty garbage cans, the dog poop, the dirty water and the flies that walk on you if they think you smell nice. I don’t like flies on me. We need to clean up our area. I want a clean place to live. We need new laws or else we are paying for out own early death. We need a new law to change the air here in Phoenix A.Z. Pollution is killing us very slowly, I might need a gas mask to walk outside during summer. We need to worry about what is happening here. I think Elon Musk might be able to help us clean up the air around here. If I were you I would write to him contact him somehow and ask him to clean up our air here In Phoenix AZ. or at least help us. I know he can help us. The air we breath will kill us if we don't create new laws against the companies that ruin the air. We might die young and simple we don’t deserve that.The Dirty Air In Phoenix Arizona"

Not only would this help with the environment but it would not bring property value down living next to a cemetery. I know if I were to die I would rather my body go to the earth and something come from me instead of my entire life be represented by a cold piece of stone.

BEAST and now since uploading his video on the 25th of October has raised millions in donations (around 8 million at the time of this post)! He and some other YouTubers then teamed up to form TeamTree with the Arbor Day Foundation to help plant more trees.

Team Trees website: [https://teamtrees.org/](https://teamtrees.org/)  


So many people are joining the effort and that the #TeamTrees collaboration is trending so much, I wondered how to take it further and get more people involved. Obviously you can help by spreading the word, sharing your opinion and taking action (Go plant \~\~A\~\~ some trees for example)! Any little bit counts and doing more is great, don't limit yourself and you may be surprised how much you can do. This effort needs more hands and more groups connected to it.  


I use this search engine called \*\*Ecosia\*\* which basically turns your searches into trees! What's easier than donating than looking up stuff on the internet like we already use Google and stuff for? They have already planted over \*\*70 MILLION Trees\*\* with their UK-based website through ad revenue generated from user searches. I would LOVE to see Ecosia connect with TeamTrees to help plant trees wherever needed.

0,"I am part of the very first Canadian pilot program of the 'Hefty Energy Bag' program, in London Ontario. Similar programs have been running for a few years in a very select number of US cities. This has been advertised as 'an easy way to divert unrecyclable plastics from landfills and convert them into energy'. 

I have found very little on this program. Basically, our household received a roll of special orange bags, which we are supposed to put all of our non-recyclable plastics in, such as food containers, meat and vegetable packaging, any kind of small food wrapper, and really any other kind of plastic that you would normally put in the garbage. Sounds great, right? Here is a link to the [Hefty Energy Bag Program](https://www.hefty.com/hefty-energybag/hefty-energybag-program).

Well unfortunately, this program is backed by some pretty big evil names like DOW Chemical and Nestle. The program got an initial bad rap in Omaha because they were burning the plastic in a cement kiln to power the kiln. [Omaha now says the majority of it's plastic is sent to pyrolysis facilities around the country](https://www.keepomahabeautiful.org/resources/heft-energy-bag.html), which appears to be a process to turn plastic into useable fossil fuels again. I do not know enough about this process to know if it's a new good or bad for the environment.

I have e-mailed my city with many questions to try and get more details. At this point I have no idea what happens to the bags after I fill them and drop them off at my local 'envirodepot'. Does anyone know any more about this process and whether or not it's something I would want to participate in? 

On one hand, keeping plastic out of landfills sounds great, but on the other, it seems to encourage the continued production of disposable plastic and fossil fuel burning.

Wonder, when will the bottom 50% start demanding the top 1% to right-size their homes in order to care for the environment?Given that California has been a leader of environmental causes and its suffering from Global Warming will only increase, why doesn't it tax homes that are too big to capture the negative externality that big floorplans have on the environmnet?

0,"I understand that plastic must be permanently rid of, but what I've been confused about for awhile now is that, am I not doing more harm by getting rid of the plastic bags I already have at home? I've got this bag, and I can't undo that. But if I dispose of it, I'm doing two things:

1) waste paper because paper bags are less durable and require constant buying/changing
2) encourage production of more plastic because at some point, somebody in some store is going to give it to me regardless

Rather than harm more trees and end up getting more plastic, wouldn't it be more logical for me to use the plastic bags I have for as long as possible? They're far more durable and I'd be doing a lot of favors. Since I've got plastic already, I might as well use it and not waste something else in that duration because whether I get rid of it or not, it's here now anyway.

I'm aware that I could be very wrong about this, but I've just always been genuinely confused about this.Isn't disposing of the already existing plastic in my house counterproductive?"

Has anyone here attended any of Jane Fonda &amp; Company’s demonstrations this past month? I’m slightly critical of her motives, but I’m planning to attend her protest with Lily Tomlin at the Capitol this morning, as I’d like to witness the event firsthand, seeing as the press is only interested in covering arrests.

I submit this inquiry in attempt to gauge how long her rallies generally last. I know they commence at 11a, but the way things are going, I won’t be arriving to the parking garage (only a block South of the Mall) until 11;10a (I’m traveling up from East Tennessee for the weekend as I write). I know 10-15 minutes doesn’t seem like much of a loss, but from what we’re getting from the media, it seems like they just show up, get arrested, and that’s it, which shouldn’t take much time, at all. I’ve a spot reserved for 2 hours, though.

Do they generally start at 11:00a on-the-dot?
Do they set aside time for speakers?
Will 2 hours be enough? Will it be too much?

**Also**, I’m traveling with my dog (very tame and friendly, so I’m not really concerned about his demeanor or whether or not he’ll disturb anyone), and I’m not, at all, interested in being arrested and risking his (and my) sanity by having him taken to the pound — plus, he will give any Animal Control officer absolute Hell if he suspects I’m in even the slightest of danger. I understand Fonda &amp; Co. are arrested on grounds of blocking the Capitol entrance — will we be safe on the lawn across the drive from the steps, or should we stay on the west side of First St NW in front of the Grant Memorial?

I’d really like to see my suspicions regarding Jane’s intentions proven wrong, and I’d like to do so as safely, legally, and efficiently as possible. Any heads up, advice, or insight will be appreciated beyond belief. And, let me know if you’re going to be there today! I tend to spend my time solely with [Milo](https://imgur.com/a/WCqImQO) when I’m in the city, but I’d love to meet some fellow Redditors fighting to address climate change this morning!

**When: Tuesday, November 12, 3pm ET**

A new report released by CXC offers a carbon pricing policy framework that contextualizes the potential role it can play in a just transition to a regenerative, sustainable, and equitable economy. If carbon pricing is to be a central component of climate policy moving forward, it must not only reduce GHG emissions, but also embrace deep overlapping connections with major social and environmental justice issues of our time.

So how exactly can carbon pricing programs improve public health, sustainable development, economic mobility, resilience, and political self-determination in the communities that need it most?

Hear from Veronica Eady of California’s Air Resources Board (CARB), Eleanor Fort of Green for All, as well as lead author Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange on his report and what we can learn from California’s experience on cap-and-trade and environmental justice.

I know that im propably running a high risk of just getting downvoted to hell instantly and I just want to say beforehand that I don´t want to shit on mrbeast and I do think that his intentions are honourable, but I geniuenly wonder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we all heard about this Viral Sensation, the Youtuber mrbeast planting (or well collecting donations to plant) 20 Million Trees.

My first Reaction was : wow mindblowing. What a fucking Behemoth of a task for one Person, he really makes a difference this is so great. Celebreties joining in, everyone seems to actually make an effort to do something good for the planet. 20,000,000 Trees - thats insane. 

I found that to be so exciting , anyone could do a part by just donating 5 or 10 or 20 Bucks and leaving a comment in this huge thing.

And I saw the comments: ""Lets keep our kind alive"" ""I want my grandchildren to see this planet"", even countires (legit or not) commenting lol.

Then I couldnt help but thinking to myself : can 20 million dollars really make that much of a difference? How many trees are there actually, how many are planted every year, how many are cut down each day?

I figured it was some huge number, propably a couple hundred billion ""or so"", but I wouldnt have guessed that its over 3 trillion. There are over 3,000,000,000,000,000 trees in the world - thats a number no one can grasp and there are a couple hundred thousand cut down every day only for toilet paper and tissues - there are propably a couple hundred thousand planted every day, even if thats only for cutting them down again eventually in some kind of  agricultural culture etc. to make it short: the numbers and proportions when it comes to trees are just insane. 20,000,000 trees arent even any kind of splash to that - thats barely any kind of expressable percentage.

Now if I think about how overwhelmingly positive people are towards this charity, and how I was , and what kind of speculative impact is behind these comments, I cant help but to now think that this is actually unfortunately kind of stupid and if anything, although with no evil intent whatsoever, eyewashing ourselves, donating 5 bucks for 5 trees and feeling good about doing nothing of any actual meaning.

Again, repeating, no hate, but if you have anything to say about this other than ""wow super cool"" you instantly get booed and I just feel like people should rather inform themselves about trees than donate 5 bucks and thinking they did something great - wont it just be a big waste of 20 million dollars in the end?

Idk whats you environmentalists take on this, am I missing something, will this geniuenly have any impact at all? Im curiousIsn´t planting 20 Million Trees actually just a wasted effort?"

Could certain penalties apply to companies who hire people who live a long distance away? You could argue that this would penalize people who might not be able to afford to live closer.  This might then set the stage to make integrated housing more of a priority for the sake of the environment.

A secondary argument might be to find ways for people to have more resources to be able to find suitable employment closer to home, or to become self-employed if that wasn’t a viable option. Would a basic income make this more feasible?Could commuting to work become regulated because of environments concerns?"

I am not.

Last night I decided to browse a lively discussion that their /b/ board regarding everyone's favourite topic: Climate change. And boy, what a discussion it was. From the intentional spreading of misinformation and bad-faith debates to endlessly-parroted talking points to scary levels of malicious apathy. 

While reading all this, I realized something. There are real people behind all these posts. These people are among us. They _are_ us. Friends, family, coworkers. These people vote. These people make purchases. These people spread their opinions elsewhere. On an anonymous board, people are more likely to share their terrible idiotic opinions without a care in the world. These opinions are, terrifyingly, more common than we'd like to think.

Reading this thread has sort of broken me. I'm honestly fully convinced after reading this that we are doomed.

Once upon a time…*in a world now dead, gone and forgotten*…there  was a Bee. And one bright and sunny day this particular Bee was flying  from flower to flower, collecting pollen, exactly as the Universe, in  its infinite wisdom, had planned for Bees to do. Nothing unusual in this  scenario, no?

No.

*Except that this Bee was the last Bee on the planet.*

And as the Bee flew from flower to flower it  collected not just pollen but also a little bit of pesticide here, a  little bit of herbicide there and God knows what other toxic,  life-destroying chemicals.

Soon, the Bee sickened and weakened, its immune  system destroyed, like all the Bees before it, by a Hell’s Brew of  poisonous products produced (at huge profit, it has to be admitted) by  Big Agro and Big Pharma in their psychopathic pursuit of profit, profit  and more profit and damn the consequences.

The Bee fell to the ground. Walked in a circle,  dazed, confused and unknowing of the evil and greed of men. It stopped,  rolled over, kicked its legs feebly. And died.

And thus it was that the last Bee left this world, and that the Beauty of Bees was stolen from the Universe for ever.

Witnessing the death of the last Bee, plants across the world cried, for they knew that without bees they, too, would soon die.

Upon seeing the plants cry, the insects cried for they knew that without plants, they too would soon die.

Upon seeing the insects cry, the birds cried for they knew that without insects, they too would soon die.

Upon seeing the birds cry, the animals cried for they knew that without birds, they too would soon die.

And then the fish cried, and the Oceans and the  Mountains and the Clouds and the Stars in the sky and even the Universe  itself cried and the sound they all made together was a sad,  bittersweet, utterly heart breaking requiem for a world that would soon  no longer be, for the loss of all that had been and all that could have  been.

There was, however, one creature upon the face of the  world that did not cry. Humanity. For humanity was too stupid to  realise that it, too, was now on a fast-track, one way road to  extinction. It was far too busy to think about a dying bee; too absorbed  in iDiotphones and FakeBook and Unsocial Media and Moronical Super  Heroes and Zombies and the farcical, money-driven pantomime that is  politics and Bling and Celebrity and the smooth, glib lies of the  Talking Head on the TV as it read out the ‘news’.

**When: October 28th, 3pm ET**

As of 2017, transportation has become the leading source of greenhouse gas pollution across all US sectors. Meanwhile, Americans suffer from ever-increasing traffic congestion, infrastructural decay, and major deficiencies in how we move people and goods around. The next decade will require bold and rapid solutions to transform the sector, both for the sake of our climate and our daily livelihoods.

The Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI), a regional cap-and-invest program for transportation emissions, has emerged as the most promising new programs to tackle both GHG emissions and transportation woes in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. However, the effectiveness of the program will depend on how it is designed and implemented in the coming year.

What exactly is TCI? What does the program mean for climate and transportation policy in the region? What role can the pivotal relationship between transportation and climate will play in the coming decade to substantially reduce emissions by 2030? How will TCI impact state-level climate policy?

Join Chris Dempsey of Transportation for Massachusetts (T4MA), Jordan Stutt of Acadia Center, and Jonah Kurman-Faber of Climate XChange, in answering and discussing these questions with you.

Lately there has been an incredible increase in development and 5 out of the 9 forests that I go running in have been clear-cut. There are only a few forests left. They have been coming in, clearing the land, and building new housing developments. I have been emailing the mayors of the cities expressing my concerns and they still don't care. They have everything backwards. One of the city commissioners told me ""This construction is good for the environment since it's close by and people will have to drive less."" Other commissioners told me ""Oh there's already a bunch of homes nearby so we don't care about this forest. It's not important since it's a fragmented ecosystem."" The problem is there's too many people moving here to Florida and these developers come by and pay 50 million dollars for the land. And money talks. So it's 50 million dollars VS the opinion of a bunch of environmentalists like me. I honestly feel like there's no hope. I don't know what to do. It breaks my heart seeing everything I love being destroyed. Honestly it's like cancer. It's been spreading sooo much. Like in places I could NEVER possibly believe.

0," Caucasian populations are disproportionately contributing to climate change through their eating habits, which uses up more food — and emits more greenhouse gases — than the typical diets of black and Latinx communities, according to a new report published in the Journal of [Industrial Ecology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12859).

Researchers tracked information from multiple databases to identify foods considered “environmentally intense” by requiring more precious resources such as water, land and energy to produce — and, as a result, releasing more greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide through production and distribution.

Potatoes, beef, apples and milk are some of the worst offenders.

“The food pipeline — which includes its production, distribution and waste — contributes significantly to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases and requires significant amounts of water and land, which also has environmental effects,” [says Joe Bozeman](https://today.uic.edu/white-peoples-eating-habits-produce-most-greenhouse-gases), a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who helped author the study.

The EPA {snip} data showed that whites produced an average of 680 kilograms of the CO2 each year, attributable to food and drink, whereas Latinx individuals produced 640 kilograms, and blacks 600.

They also found the diets of white people required 328,000 liters of water on average per year. Latinx used just 307,000 liters, and blacks 311,800. Both black and Latinx individuals used more land per capita with 1,770 and 1,710 square meters per year, respectively, than white people with just 1,550. Nevertheless, white people still made the greatest overall contribution to climate change.

“{snip} it’s very clear that whites are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food choices,” says Bozeman.

In a nutshell, they say that if we convert all the agriculture to organic farming. The required scale of each exploitation to be as efficient as conventional farming will be larger and then generates more pollution. In addition, organic farming will not be enough efficient at all to feed the whole population so a country like UK will be forced to import food supplies generating even more pollution.

0,"I would like to share an idea and hope to have a constructive brainstorming session. Global warming poses a great threat for humanity and it is predicted that it might have huge impact on drinkable freshwater resources. My proposal to adress this issue is to increase the water cycle in an energy-neural way using ""evaporation farms"". The idea is to increase the natural evaporation rate on the sea surface dramatically that would result in more clouds and thus, more rainfall on the land. I think this would also help global warming in two ways: (i) more clouds will reflect the sunlight with the high ""albedo"" effect like in the poles, (ii) and the heat of the sunlight will be captured by the natural evaporation while trapping the heat at ocean/sea surface.

So, how can we achieve this? I am sure there are many creative ways to do this, and I will be happy to hear your ideas. Here, my suggestion is a floating isolation surface that will enclose a thin layer of water from the rest of the sea. You can see a simplistic sketch trying to explain what I mean. The energy from the sunlight will improve the evaporation rate locally in this pool. Ideally, this will be a completely passive process with no energy requirement except sunlight (excluding production costs). With directed pores, we can replace the evaporated water with continuous flow driven by local currents in the sea. As the energy will be redirected to evaporation, the deeper layers of the sea/ocean will not warm up as without the isolated layer of evaporation farm. Similar to desalination, salt/evaporite might accumulate and to avoid this, the buoyancy might be adjusted during the day to wash off the salt. Of course, there are many challenges in scaling up this project. The initial cost should be minimum so we can cover a larger area of sea surface near the coasts. It is hard for me to judge whether technological solutions would be scalable enough to impact the overall evaporation rates both locally and globally. Any idea if you think this would work at all and why not?

We need to do this due to health and safety risks, changing gloves, using paper towels for cleaning, high electricity usages for centrifuges etc.

I’ve already started to lower energy uses in my clinic by only running the centrifuge at certain times/when there are multiple samples to be spun. Other than that and turning off the computer at the source each day, there isn’t anything else I can do.

I’m also water conscious, I only use it to wash my hands. 

But I use a lot of gloves, probably 30ish pairs a day. I cannot help this. It is for my and my patients safety.

What else can I do? I try my best not to have to redo something using more materials, I use less paper towels to dry surfaces after cleaning.

0,"So I’m 27 and I’ve hit a wall in my life. 

I’ve been working in the visual arts world for eight years now as a photographer and production assistant. As the art/photo economy becomes more dense and competitive, I feel like my work is just swallowed up into a dark mass that is the art community. For years the issues with the planet and climate change have just been looming over our heads and growing worse and worse. While I thoroughly enjoy what I do and have always felt fulfilled even when the work was hard, I feel like the most important contribution I can make as an individual right now would be to help fight climate change. 

As much as I love the arts, I feel a responsibility to commit myself to help the environment. I’ve always felt this way since I was little, but I always had very poor self-esteem and thought I was never smart enough to pursue a career in ecology or anything. I still feel that way. I read and see things about how the shit show of western capitalism is damaging the planet and fucking up foreign agricultures and societies (just thinking about the avocado, quinoa, and cocaine markets makes me ill). I read about these things and I feel this passion that I want to work somewhere that aids the environment and fights climate change, but I don’t know where I begin...

I don’t have any formal training or education in policy, ecology, agriculture, law, science, etc. The skills I learned are almost completely useless compared to a lawyer or researcher. I guess the only useful skill I can contribute to a possible job position would be that I’m bilingual (French) and have administrative experience. Besides that, I feel totally useless. My brother in law sells solar panels, and while he has no previous interest in it, he’s doing really well. That does give me hope that even a basic sales job can still help in the fight to save the planet. But still, I just don’t know where or how to apply myself. 

For those professionals working for companies that aid the environment, how did you start? Have any suggestions for someone looking to start a new career?

0,"It has been a problem for a while now in Canada. As a country whose economy is largely dependent on the oil and gas industry, the exhausting debate over whether Canada should continue to invest in the oilsands and in energy pipelines is still ongoing. While I definitely agree that climate change is one of the world's most critical issues, I too feel that it would be unfair to neglect the legitimate concerns of those working in the oil and gas industry. 

Now I am not talking about those oil and gas CEOs who would be totally O.K. with turning Alberta into one large, toxic oil pit if it meant more dollars filled their pockets. However, there are those that depend on it for a living and those that are worried about themselves and their family, and what the future holds for them. That was particularly evident from the wave of blue (voting Conservative) across the prairies in the recent election. The unfortunate truth is that we cannot get rid of oil overnight. What also cannot happen overnight is Alberta moving its economic focus from almost solely oil and gas into other industries.

Therefore, I was wondering what others were thinking about a possible compromise between the two sides. Is it possible to strike a balance between the economic interests of oil and gas advocates (or perhaps, people who just want a job at the end of the day) with the  environmental interests of climate change activists? If so, how could this be done? If and when we begin shifting away slowly from oil (which should be right now), what is the most practical and reasonable way to go about doing this?

0,"So I've had this idea for quite a while. Im currently taking a year off from college to travel so I haven't really had a chance to discuss it with anyone, so I'm curious on what you guys would think. As you may know, the world has a waste management problem, especially in the US where it seems that the way the companies are managing our waste is not very effective. I'm quite curious if the aspect of WM in the US being a business is infringing on us really solving our issue of really getting rid of the waste that is really screwing up our cities, the environment, and our health. The ways that we are dealing with them now include landfills, incineration, dumping it in the ocean, and sending it off to less developed countries to deal with it. With a country as rich as the US, I believe we really could be handling our WM alot more effectively and sustainably. I speculate if we depend on private companies to clean up our oceans and deal with our millions of tons of waste, it will never get done. Call me naive for putting my eggs in the basket of government, but with the amount of money we waste on our military, we really could be doing wonders on cleaning up our oceans and dealing with waste. So this is what I propose. Imagine if a govt agency was created just for cleaning up trash and disposing it (of course in a far more sophisticated way than just landfills which is quite barbaric because eventually were gonna run out of space like in WALL E). With all the trash in the ocean, it would create tons of jobs! If the govt were to invest more in to research of WM I'm sure we could solve the problem in far more efficient and green way. The one thing that I think could be used is plasma gasification. I know the argument is that its expensive and doesn't create that much energy. But the thing is the amount of plasma gasification plants around the world is kind of small and they're funded by private companies. And I'm pretty sure the US govt could afford it if they wanted to. But in conclusion I believe the incentive of profiting off of trash will shoot our foot in the long run. We should be aiming to limit the amount of waste going out and dealing with that waste properly, not worried about the money, but worried about just eliminating it. It's like picking up your dog poop only because you get money out if it. That shouldn't be the case we should clean it up because we have to. So that would technically mean we need to tax companies that are in fact producing 90+% of the waste and holding them accountable.

1. Are there any tools / companies for this sort of project management that can be particularly recommended on the basis of environmental factors?

0,"According to Popular Science of Bonnier Corporation there is a big thing they called the best us project that says, “On May 4, 2007, a tornado ripped through central Kansas. When it was over, nearly 95 percent of the small town of Greensburg was destroyed. Turning tragedy into opportunity, the community decided to rebuild itself as a model green town, powered by a mix of geothermal, solar and wind. A few of the city buildings even power themselves with their own wind and solar generators, and a 10-turbine wind farm outside of town went online in March” this is a great thing that happened but we don't all have tornadoes (tornadoes not a good thing but still) to reset so we need to take the initiative to fix out towns that use a lot of Co2 and turn them into greentowns.

Instead of taking a town down we need to switch to renewable energy source or a not so harmful energy source. Witch is nuclear power, many people hate nuclear power and I don’t get that there is nothing wrong with nuclear power. The smoke you see coming out of the top is not smoke its steam from the plant to spin the turbine and it is a very good source of energy. We need more nuclear power plants and less coal plants and a good renewable source so we can stop harming the environment and start helping it.

If we don’t use this solution or any other solution we could destroy this planet, it would destroy the oceans and would increase the temperature of our planet or other known as global warming so all of us should care but most of us don’t, we need everyone to care so we can make a big difference, or this will be the biggest trophic cascade or extinction in history the end of man.

Organic farming uses less pesticides, fertilisers and herbicides than non-organic practices, and organic-farming advocates also claim it saves water and controls erosion.  But converting the world's agriculture to organic would actually produce far more carbon dioxide emissions, according to a new study. 

In a scenario in which England and Wales hypothetically switched to 100 per cent organic farming practices, researchers found organic methods typically had much lower nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of area farmed, thanks to the use of nitrogen-fixing plants rather than fertilisers.

But the volume of food grown per unit of area farmed organically was 40 per cent less than yields from conventional farming methods, according to the [**research, published in the journal Nature Communications today**](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-10-23/organic-vs-non-organic-farming-emissions/10.1038/s41467-019-12622-7).

Also learned about adapters for ICE cars.  Only $300!  I have a 2011 and it is too old for electric retrofit nor do I have the cash anyway.  But even if E85 is less efficient and reduces my range I’d gladly trade it!

2. Modern Climate Change has been primarily caused by human activity
3. Its potential effects are very serious and should not be ignored
4. There are already feasible remedies to this problem that we can be implementing right now

The warmer water melts the  surrounding ice.Ice Breakers Contribute to the Melting of Polar Ice"

My name is Gabi. I'm an early-career conservation biologist working at an NGO in the Washington DC Area. My speciality is in human-wildlife conflict mitigation and multivariate spatial and statistical analyses, and most of my career thus far has been in eastern and southern Africa. I've just started a Youtube Channel (videos posted weekly or biweekly) recently with a wildlife rehab professional to promote diverse voices in conservation.

As a person of color who is also nonbinary, I grew up without any role models in the sciences that looked like me or that shared my experience, and representation, as I grow in the field, has been incredibly important in my development. I want to do the same thing for other early-career scientists or conservationists and to highlight the incredible breadth and variety of career paths in conservation and in STEM.

**So, I'm looking for interviewees!** If you are a diverse person in conservation or in STEM, and you're interested in promoting your work, we want to hear from you. Interviews are between 15-30 minutes long, and any interview questions would be sent to you ahead of time for your perusal and approval. I'm most free after before 8 AM or after 6:30 PM on weekdays Eastern Standard Time and can be flexible on most weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

 

#### The United Nations estimates that at the rate we are depleting our farmland, we have fewer than 60 years of soil left on Earth.

### Can we feed the world without destroying the planet?

**The answer depends on what we do now!**

The good news is, there ARE solutions. *The Need To GROW* takes you inside the hearts and innovations of three very different leaders - an 8-year-old girl challenges the ethics of a beloved organization - a renegade farmer struggles to keep his land as he revolutionizes resource-efficient agriculture - and an accomplished visionary inventor faces catastrophe in the midst of developing a game-changing technology.

Narrated by Rosario Dawson (*Marvel’s The Defenders*, *The Lego Batman Movie*), *The Need To GROW* delivers an epic story of solutions and the struggles to implement them. It will make you laugh, make you cry, give you chills, and inspire you to participate in the restoration of the Earth.

Shouldn't our environmental flank be focused on more than the right policies at home? If this is a global collective action problem, then in the end game, don't we need to also show leadership on the world stage, and push for the kind of Real Climate Accord that won't fall apart with the first free-rider nation, the first right-wing election in a major emitting country, the first profit-first administration that sees no harm in letting other countries decarbonize first? RealClimateAccord.com stands for the idea that our international framework should be science-based, accountable, monitorable, enforceable, and have real incentives to comply. It's a simple thing, a foundational thing, and a loud silence in the movement right now.

Yes, while all our local and national efforts to impact climate change are important and necessary, there's a very real case to be made that tackling a global collective action problem with purely voluntary contributions at the national level shouldn't work, hasn't worked, isn't working now. The demand for a Real Climate Accord can be a common denominator for people across the political spectrum, at every level of civil society. And especially within the environmental movement, the least we can push for on the international stage is that, however countries choose to reach their goals, those goals should be real: that is, science-based, measurable, monitored, incentivized, enforceable.

This is the endgame we never speak of, perhaps because it's not politically possible today. But it will be politically inevitable before this is over. And we should hasten that day.

He was given a project to hook up the methane vents from the local landfill to a generator. The problem was, R-12 Freon from old refrigerators was leaking into gas supply then breaking down into hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid which required the engine to be rebuilt once a month.

His solution was simple. He raised the water jacket temperature so the freon passed through the combustion chamber unchanged then passed into the exhaust system where it broke down into harmless byproducts. The muffler would need to be changed more often, but this was an acceptable and economical compromise.

Too big trees can either be sold as wind breakers for the many new farms needing evergreens for coffee and chocolate. Or they can be cut for Christmas Trees for larger companies.

We do grow Christmas Trees- the current 'stock' is about 5,000 trees locally sourced. The market is over 200,000 trees more needed per year.

We will have to deliver by truck when needed - or families could pick up on own.

We want to try a subscription model for families to propagate a Sacred Ohi'a Tree as well as ' be the steward for a Christmas Tree. We're making a direct correlation to people buying imported trees caused many of the diseases in Hawaii- including the one that is killing Ohi'a.

You are right that many people prefer 5 year old trees. HI grows some plants more quickly. We are thinking of using both an artificial tree for size and an adopted Christmas Tree as well as an Ohi'a tree for new family traditions.

Trees are sustainable. We believe that our value is preventing the billions of dollars of damage importing diseased dead trees causes Hawaii's fragile ag and ecosystem.Working on ideas to add value to land in Hawaii through trees."

While not much of it will be surprising to the general public who agree that climate change is real, there is a part of the video that goes into detail about microplastics. Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 mm, some are used in cosmetics and toothpaste but the majority are seen in already existing plastic waste that has been exposed to UV radiation. 51 trillion particles are ingested by marine life; many of which we consume. The concerning part is the lack of knowledge we have about how these plastics we ingest are going to affect us in the long term. We know there is some evidence on BPA affecting our hormones and DEHP being linked to cancer, but there is not enough evidence or knowledge on how this will affect humans in the years to come. 8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have phthalates in their body along with 93% of us having BPA in our urine. WTF? My eyes were quite wide throughout the whole video. I couldn't believe that this was not being talked about enough in the news, with doctors, and among my peers in class. I feel as though in the future this will be a bigger topic but there needs to be a jump start in research before it is too late.

In the matter of a few months, Greta Thunberg went from a lone girl protesting in front of the Swedish parliament to an international phenomenon. Although mass media is making it seem as if this meteoric rise to prominence happened organically, this is simply not true.

Behind Greta is a major machine, one that is controlled by major international actors and backed by major funds. This PR machine has allowed Greta to make the covers of magazines, become the subject of thousands of news articles while being photographed with world leaders and giving speeches at elite organizations such as the United Nations.

Although Greta might very well be genuinely concerned with the fate of the planet, her message is carefully crafted by those who control her to generate a specific response from the youth. In short, Greta is the face of a major marketing scheme – a tightly coordinated international effort to sell global warming through a specific lens: Fear, panic, and urgency.

Before going further, I need to point out that I am neither a “climate denier” nor a “climate activist”. That is not my field of expertise. I never analyzed any data regarding climate change and its correlation with human activity. I am far from qualified from speaking about this issue so I won’t.

My field of expertise is mass media and its relation to power. In the “[Read This First](https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/mind-control-theories-and-techniques-used-by-mass-media/)” article of this site, I explained (using quotes from the founders of the field of Communications such as Edward Bernays) how mass media is used to shape and mold opinions. The rise of Greta to international prominence is a clear-cut case of “agenda-setting” which is defined as follows:

&gt;Agenda-setting is the creation of public awareness and concern of salient issues by the news media. As well, agenda-setting describes the way that media attempts to influence viewers, and establish a hierarchy of news prevalence. Two basic assumptions underlie most researches on agenda-setting:  
the press and the media do not reflect reality; they filter and shape it;  
media concentration on a few issues and subjects leads the public to perceive those issues as more important than other issues.

📷

**A classic representation of the agenda-setting theory.**

Most media outlets are owned by a handful of mega-corporations, making it very easy for the elite to saturate the world with a specific message. And the meteoric rise of Greta is a result of this kind of media saturation. In fact, her entire movement is undeniable proof of the extreme reach and power of mass media in the world today which is able to create massive movements out of nothing.

Mass media programming is particularly effective on those who did not develop an acute sense of critical thinking – notably young people. And the Greta phenomenon was custom-made to cater to this very specific demographic.

Here’s a look at the rise of Greta.

**Ernman on the cover of Vi magazine. The quote under her face says: “We all sell our souls to the devil”. Can’t make this up.**

In 2017, Ernman won the WWF “Environmental Hero” award for her “involvement in the climate issue for the past several years”. About a year later, Ernman’s 16-year-old daughter is seen protesting in front of the Swedish parliament. The perfect storm begins.

# Rise to Prominence

📷

**Greta photographed during her first climate strike.**

On August 20th, 2018, Greta Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish Parliament with a sign saying “School strike for the climate”. Four days later, the book *Scenes From the Heart* was published by her mother.

**The cover of** ***Scenes From the Heart.***

Written as a “family autobiography”, the book discusses various issues such as Greta’s Asperger’s syndrome, which Ernman describes as a “superpower”. In one bizarre passage, Ernman states that Greta can actually see carbon dioxide emanating from vehicles and buildings.

The perfect timing between Greta’s strike and the book release was not a coincidence. And Greta’s strike certainly did not go unnoticed.

On the very same day of the first strike, a picture of Greta was published on the Facebook page of *We Don’t Have Time*, a “social network for climate change”. The page is managed by Ingmar Rentzhog – a specialist in financial marketing.

**Rentzhog at a climate strike.**

Rentzhog is also a chairman of the Global Utmaning Board, a think tank that “promotes sustainable development within social, economic and environmental dimensions”. The Global Utmaning Board was founded by the Swedish politician and economist Kristina Persson, who is the daughter of the billionaire politician and entrepreneur Sven O. Persson.

Backed by this machine, Greta’s story garnered intense and immediate media attention in Sweden and, soon after, around the world. After a few months of weekly strikes, Greta took a year off from school to focus solely on climate change and began a tour of European cities.

During these events, a woman was often spotted “advising” Greta: Luisa-Marie Neubauer.

📷

**Luisa-Marie Neubauer with Greta.**

Neubauer is a member of ONE Campaign, an organization managed by Bill Gates and Bono, which is heavily funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

On the Associated Press’ “fact-checking” site, an article with the bizarre title [*Climate activist Greta Thunberg does not have ‘handler’*](https://www.apnews.com/afs:Content:7740750778) asserts that Luisa-Marie Neubauer does not serve as Greta’s “handler”. It nevertheless admits that Neubauer is linked with this powerful Soros-funded group.

&gt;According to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation website, “One originated in conversations between Bill Gates and Bono in the early 2000s about the need to better inform Americans about extreme poverty around the world.” The One Campaign has ties to Soros, founder and chairman of Open Society Foundations, which works to build democracies.  
Brooke Havlik, a communications officer with Open Society Foundations, told the AP that the organization has given $10 million to the One Campaign since 2011.

Through these powerful connections, Greta skyrocketed on the world stage. She gave speeches at Ted X talks, the European Parliament, the United Nations and she was even nominated for a Nobel Prize. She also met world leaders and celebrities across the world, including the Pope.

**Greta with the Pope.**

Of course, mass media went into overdrive to turn Greta into a larger-than-life icon as she graced magazine covers around the world.

From a lone girl protesting in front of the Swedish parliament, Greta turned into a figure of heroism and martyrdom.

📷

**A banner turning Greta into a religious figure.**

After touring Europe, Greta embarked on a boat and sailed to America where she was hailed as a hero, spawning massive school strikes wherever she went.

Through mass media, Greta became an important factor in local and international politics and made global warming a top priority in the Western world.

But what is exactly the role of Greta in the grand scheme of things?

# Greta’s Role

Although many are ready to deny this fact with great vigor (because it goes against their agenda), Greta is merely a pawn. She is controlled by powerful people and big money to promote a specific agenda. The agenda is not merely about climate change – it is about climate change through a very specific angle.

Her role was perfectly defined by Greta herself during a speech at the (very elite) World Economic Forum:

&gt;“Adults keep saying we owe it to the young people, to give them hope. But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.”

Panic and fear: Two words that lead to hasty and irrational responses based on negative emotions. And this fear and panic is being thoroughly ingrained into the youth, creating a generation that is convinced that the world is burning.

📷

**A young school girl protesting: Greta’s target audience.**

Greta is the face of a massive push across mass media and the education system to convince children that their “house in on fire”. Since children absorb the information that is given to them without any kind of questioning, this push has created a new worrying phenomenon: Eco-anxiety.

📷

**An i-D magazine headline about eco-anxiety.**

Instead of enjoying their childhood, children are growing up with a sense of dread and impending doom. Researchers are already linking environmental concerns with cases of anxiety, depression and even suicide. Greta herself communicated this feeling during her speech at the U.N.:

&gt;“How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”

Although Greta might be genuinely concerned about climate change, those behind her have a much darker agenda: To create a generation of children riddled with anxiety and depression, giving the elite carte blanche for drastic measures, ranging from tax hikes to the loss of personal freedoms. And let’s not forget the main goal of it all (which is also the main goal of the elite organizations behind Greta): The creation of a single world government, ruled by the world elite … to combat climate change, of course.

# In Conclusion

Any person who dares to take a critical look at the Greta phenomenon is immediately faced with the same backlash: “How dare you bully an autistic girl?” and “You’re a climate denier”. As seen above, this article was not about Greta herself, her looks or her mental health. It was about those behind her, the powerful machine that provided her the platform to become a media darling.

Furthermore, this article was not about “denying” climate change or any other environmental issues. It is about how this issue is “sold” through a specific lens, one that is based on fear, panic, and urgency. Like any other important issue, pollution needs to be addressed in a rational matter, starting with the core sources of the problem. In the U.S., the sectors of transportation, industry and electric power account for over 80% of greenhouse gas emissions. In other words, elite-owned corporations are the main polluters in the world today. They are the ones emitting tons upon tons of carbon dioxide in the air while dumping tons upon tons of toxic waste in water streams. Instead of tackling these industries head-on, the elite parades around an autistic girl, films world leaders clapping at her speeches and encourages children to be afraid.

Why? Because what they are truly looking for is control and submission. And the best way to obtain control and submission is by creating a fearful and panicky population that begs for governments to fix its problems.The Elite Machine Behind Greta Thunberg"

The cause to help protect our planet is one that has become one that is very personal to me. Sustainability is the most important aspect for every human on the planet today. The urgency to act towards this cannot be greater. If we do not move towards a sustainable future, then there is no future left for this planet. This is a change that began on an individual level where I realised the level of self-discipline to act and my own eco-consciousness developing with the products I use. As a consumer, seeking products that are better for the planet meant that as an entrepreneur, my drive to develop these types of products became strong.

Since we began our mission to pave the future for mobile accessories, one that helps protect our planet instead of damaging it, the words and actions of one particular person have stood out to me. Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist from Sweden, has been a name I have brought up with my team time and time again during this journey. However, it was her most recent speech that struck me most. “How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business-as-usual”, she said during the UN Climate Action Summit last month. It became clear that our actions by making 100% Biodegradable cases is the way forward in this industry. Our spirit of innovativeness is driving us to create accessories that look and feel just as good as the plastic alternatives, but don’t harm our planet in the way that they do. Uunique was founded upon recognising a gap in the market for mobile accessories with real style, and being able to nurture that history in a way what is sustainable for our planet is the only way to go from now.This is a change that began on an individual level"

I've been working on creating some plastic alternative products that currently aren't on the market but I've had difficulty finding a base ingredient that wont lead to more negative emissions or environmental degradation (e.g. most biodegradable products can lead to high amounts of methane emission which can be potentially worse for the environment than petroleum options)

I've been looking into hemp based bio-plastic (hemp filled polylactic acid) and this relatively new biopolymer - Mango Materials, the company, sourced directly from their site - ""produces a naturally occurring biopolymer from waste biogas (methane) that is economically competitive with conventional petroleum-based plastics"" (they basically take captured methane from landfills - feed it to methane eating bacteria and the bacteria produces this type of biopolymer).

I'm leaning towards Mango Materials because it seems to be the most immediate way we can help fix the methane problem and its the safest/most effective biodegradable option but because it is a closed loop I'm a little concerned what the future impacts may look like.

0,"For some reason, in the last year or so more than any other, Climate Change has become one of the defining issues in contemporary western society. Hell, half of Monday night's debate was based on climate change. But my question isn't about if climate change is real, my question revolves around what are the real goals of the environmental movement. It seems lots of the people that are protesting are just complaining to the government to do something.

So my main questions are:

1. If the governments have essentially failed every time to get any significant amount of change through, why would they complain to these governments who have such a bad track record. If they've failed essentially every single time over the last 50 years why would they listen, let alone do anything this time?
2. If Climate Change is actually a serious issue, are insurance companies and the like preparing for a crisis? And why are lots of Climate Change activists like Obama buying Mansions in areas that are apparently going to be hit hard by Climate Change?
3. How is complaining to a government in a western country going to influence China, India, Russia and other developing nations? It'll be extremely hard to convince these countries to actually follow through.
4. What happens if a massive volcano erupts and that 12 years becomes 6? Are there any natural events like a volcano eruption that could affect the trajectory of climate change by releasing a ton of shit into the atmosphere?
5. Is there actually a plan to fight climate change? From what I see, it seems to be more of a wish list of demands.
6. If all of these protesters actually think that in the coming years massive disasters are going to happen why aren't they prepping? By Prepping I mean like storing up on food, precious metals, first aid, power, self defense, etc and preparing for a disaster. Noah didn't complain to anybody about a coming flood, he just built an arc. Wouldn't their effort be better spent in preparing for any potential disasters?
7. Is there actually any leadership and direction in the movement other than making these demands?
8. Not to get into any identity politics but, if Climate change is real then why do most environmentalists support mass immigration? 1st world citizens releases way more emissions than developing nations. Why don't they even support taking a break from immigration until a carbon neutral infrastructure is created? I understand the economic arguments that people aren't having enough kids, but Asians, the ethnicity that makes up a majority or so of the immigrants have less kids than Caucasians and Natives so won't there just be an endless spiral where we'll have to import more and more Immigrants just to keep the economy afloat? And if Climate Change causes 100s of millions of refugees, and they come to 1st world countries, won't that just cause more Emissions and make Climate change worse and cause a giant downward spiral where the climate crashes forever (or at least 1000s of years)?

My goal isn't to attack the Environmentalists, but is to better understand the Ideology, specifically by asking questions that no one in the mainstreams seems to have answered. I simply don't know

I see it kind of like a crash diet. You could try to lose 60 pounds in a few weeks, but you'll probably fail and even if you do succeed you'll gain it all back. From what I see, the movement isn't really changing anything except a few young minds that won't have the same point of view once their generation comes to power. Their demands are really vague and don't really have any structure. That's why lots of people have doubt and think the movement is just for political clout or something.

I can see why governments are so hesitant to pass the Green New Deal. If for some reason or another, Climate change doesn't become the massive disaster it was hyped up to be, America is economically destroyed for nothing and people will be 1000X more pissed off.

At least that's my view as someone looking from the outside in.

Bonus Question:

If Russians and the like are spending millions trying to meddle with elections, then wouldn't they be trying to make ideas that will bankrupt America like the Green New Deal popular legislation? Even if it doesn't pass, it will still shift the Overton Window of what is acceptable in politics towards radical impulsive spending.What are the goals of the Environmental Movement?"

TL,DR: The Minor Sea at Murcia, Spain is suffering from an ecological collapse. There is no oxygen in water and thousands of marine species are dying atm

This is how the Minor Sea got contaminated after three decades of breaking the law. A half assed truth about the water that irrigated the land and a subterranean chaos of canals,desalination plants and polluting discharges that were fomented and then let out grow out of control. 
Year 2011. 
A pipe is found buried in the fields of Cartagena. The contents are tested. Its brine contaminated with nitrates, from the desalination of an aquifer contaminated by the fertilzer of nearby lands, a hazardous tipping if it reached the Minor Sea. If it were to accumulate, it could cause a [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication)
 Its decided to block the pipe. Four/five workers get there with the necessary equipment, but at the last moment they are told not to block it. Its a call from the presidency of the hydrographic confederation of river Segura. The plubial agent that found the pipe comments with a friend that an officer told him to ""let be the desalination plants thing"" (declaration from the plubial agent 1932 in the Topillo case)

Its only the tip of the iceberg on whats beneath the ground. the ""desalination plants thing"" its already a problem of over one hundred illegal instalations and a network of subterranean canalizations that spill near the Minor Sea
That same year, the whole agriculture system changed. In a dry land its promoted the cultivation and orography to drain the water with the slopes so the water never gets retained.
Near the road there is a giant pipe that noone saw being installed and it has no propietary. Noone has responsability. Its a pipe that drains the water between fields and pumps it at the Minor Sea.
Year 2016
The waters of Minor Sea become a green soup for a few months. The government of Murcia and the hydrographic confederation of Segura hurry to take measures to prevent the spillings.
Year 2019
[Cold Drop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_drop). (this paragraph explains the civilian damages of this year cold drop)
But there is an image that no camera took. Another disaster has been breewing for years at the Minor Sea. The levels of oxygen have been declining and the clorophyl has been rampant since this summer. The rains from 13 september made it worse.

The rest of the article explains in precise detail all the geological, political and administrative reasons that led to this disaster. 
Right now there are thousands of marine life dying as you can see at the hundreds of videos at the hastag [#MarMenor](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarMenor)The Minor Sea at Spain suffering from an ecological collapse after three decades of breaking the law and a illegal network of uncontrolled waste"
0,"I am trying to be more environmentally friendly. For example, I live with my mother to reduce the amount of space I take up. I have replaced nearly all of my meat with beyond meat or similar products. I have replaced all cow milk with plant milks eg almond milk. I borrow from the bank to invest in ethical ETFs. I won't ever have any children. 

Where I am struggling is ditching my car. I have a bike and ride to the train station and catch a bike to go to work. It takes fifteen minutes by bike. However, having to ride with the traffic is annoying. One day I was riding on the footpath and a motorist drove past and told me not to do that because it was illegal (which it is). Then when I rode on the road, I was one day entering a narrow road and a motorist behind me had to slow down and started shouting at me, telling me to ride on the footpath instead.

My mother is against me riding my bike and so has purchased a brand new car for herself and given me her old bomb, a 2001 small Japanese car. It works fine and I find that it is much more convenient driving to the station.

However, I am concerned about the emissions from the car. I have been thinking of buying an electric car but they seem expensive.

Is there any benefit in buying an electric car or is driving the small old car a little bit just to get to the train station good enough?Drive small old car vs buy new electric car"
0,"There is an opinion article below about how bad food delivery apps like Deliveroo are. According to the writer, food delivery apps encourage people to stay at home and be lazy and eat while workers are being exploited. They discourage people from being social and instead encourage them to stay isolated.

[https://www.theage.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/in-the-name-of-civility-let-s-ban-food-delivery-apps-or-at-least-use-them-less-20191009-p52z4d.html](https://www.theage.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/in-the-name-of-civility-let-s-ban-food-delivery-apps-or-at-least-use-them-less-20191009-p52z4d.html)

However, usually when people are lazy and go out, they prioritise convenience, and as a result they usually drive to where they need to be. However, if these people order food via a delivery app then the company needs to be work out the most profitable way to deliver the food there, and it is usually via bike, ebike, or motorbike, which is far more energy efficient and via car.

The more I look at it, a lot of environmental degradation comes from being ""social"" and living a normal life whereas the most environmentally friendly way of living seems to be a lifestyle taken from a dystopian movie e.g. living by yourself in an apartment next to work, working all the time, never travelling, never socialising, walking to work, watching TV or reading books for recreation, etc.Are food delivery apps good for the environment?"

0," You know in my opinion climate change and environmentalists demonizing oil and gas companies is not very smart, it just creates a negative relationship. 

If anyone needs capital for charitable projects or environmentally friendly projects like green energy or gas to power replacing coal or diesel, oil and gas companies would invest billions if they can be shown via a secular mainstream TV series broadcast worldwide doing this in the countries they operate in.

If the projects are shown to make money the general public will invest in those companies and countries profiled. Further if financial institutions are shown to facilitate investments by mitigating corruption into developing countries they would attract more capital to their funds.

We are a small part of life on this planet and we selfishly view the inevitable changes as unacceptable. The millisecond or second or minute on the clock of life that we have participated in is monumentally inconsequential. The argument isn’t about saving or protecting earth. It’s about continuing what we have decided is a good life for ourselves. I truly believe that humans have begun a process that will see our current way of life nonexistent. But I also believe that we can work together to try and help create a new way for all of us to live together that coexists with what life will exist in the conditions we have helped (or condemned) earth to support.

All the environmental initiatives are only temporary palliative band aids. China proved limiting births is not feasible. The forces against it are misgivings of racism, xenophobia and eugenics. 

The root cause of these misgivings and unwillingness to look at the root cause of environmental destruction is limited intelligence among average people. 

Just anecdotally, I have the honor of hanging with a coterie of intellectuals from Cambridge, MA, mostly females, who are smarter than I am. Most have PhD's. None of the women have or will have any children. Not that any of them think one person can make any difference on the environment by not having children, but they want to live in the spirit of their knowledge. They also want freedom and wealth.

An example of the environmental impact of not having children is thus: I don’t have children. I calculated that compared against a person who has two, and his kids follow suit, and grand kids, over the three generations, I will have polluted 1/16th as much, and used up 1/16th of the resources exploited by the other man. I don’t have to recycle and I can drive a Hummer and still be way ahead of the comparative man who might be trying his best to be environmentally responsible, irrespective of the children.

Raising bison functions as regenerative agriculture for the grasslands and prairies in this area: bison evolved with the grasses, their hoofs grind native seeds into the soil, their dung is good for the soil, certain birds rely on them etc. They also require very little externally provided food: they can dig through 5 ft of snow to forage grasses, dig up minerals in the soil, and break ice for water. The operation I work on is grass fed only, with hay in the winter. As far as I can tell, the op I work on is the closest to sustainable meat one can produce in the US. 

All that being said, when considering non arable lands/land that requires fertilizer yearly to be agriculturally viable, which is more ethical, from an environmental standpoint, growing bison or growing wheat/corn/soybeans etc? 

I asked this question of the vegetarians of reddit and got an unbelievable number of canned animal rights responses. I am not interested in the ethics of animal use or consumption. Instead, I am interested in the ethics of producing native vs non native species, or producing one species that helps the soil but hurts the air vs one that helps the air but hurts the soil. Land use ethics, if you will

There are pros and cons to each side, but I legitimately cannot come to a conclusion. Thoughts?Ethical question: wheat or bison?"

I warn first, I'm not even close to any kind of scientist, what I've pieced together, is based on internet searches.

&amp;#x200B;

Global initiative to create massive amounts of renewable energy, collect 1% of the potential solar energy that falls to earth 0.89 PetaWatt. Paid for by a global tax on everyone. 1.

Construction of alternative renewable energy production.

Switch to plant based diets, grown in hydroponics, as well as on land, using most efficient technologies available. 2. 

Small, resource cheap and healthy meats, poultry, fish. 

Otherwise, use of grown or ""cultured"" meat. 3.

Reduction of global lifestock of cows, sheep, pigs, which reduces need for agriculture land to feed them.

Sustainable food production.

Incredible focus on science. Education and survival of all people on the world, regardless of country of original, wealth, race, or gender.

CO2 sources (119 + 88 + 6.3 = 213.3) human source: 6.3 of total 213.3 = 2.95%

In 2019 CO2 = 410 ppm - 280 ppm in 1800 (industrial revolution) = 130ppm total co2 during human industrial times

2.95% of 130 = It took humans 220 years to add 3.8ppm (probably less than 3.8ppm because highest output started in the 1950s) 

 It's  a good estimate using all the sources in the IPCC's simplified diagram.  In 220 years the CO2 level is up by 130ppm, an average gain of .59ppm  per year. You're all probably right the gain is likely related to the  earth's largest CO2 sink the oceans. I'm sure you are aware that cool sea water can hold more CO2 than warm sea water. [Here](http://climate4you.com/images/SolarIrradianceReconstructedSince1610%20LeanUntil2000%20From2001dataFromPMOD.gif)  is a good explanation for slightly warmer oceans.

Haze has caused political tension between these countries, businesses struggling to function and children unable to leave their own homes. Recently, Malaysia and Singapore have decided they have had enough of Indonesia turning a blind eye by allowing these palm oil companies to continue to burn land in order to get ready to plant new trees faster and have begun to push Indonesia into creating some sort of change. Something must be done in Indonesia as it is hurting the relationships between the countries, the economy, and the people in order to fix this Indonesia and Malaysia need to follow Singapore’s example of Transboundary Haze Pollution Act in order to slow down the use of slash and burn method and eventually eliminate it completely. On a personal scale, consumers can look for palm oil products with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) label. Which is a verification that these companies use harmless harvesting methods. Indonesia must invest in more educational campaigns and stricter law enforcement in order to educate the locals and regulate the burning. Completely shutting down the palm oil industry will be disastrous for their local economy so it is important to use other methods, although they may be more time consuming, it will be worth it in the long run as the tensions between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore will decrease, the economy will not go through rough stretches during the haze season, and people will begin to live healthy lives as they are breathing much cleaner air.The soultion to slash and burn agriculture"

0,"A friendly reminder that listing a handful of cherry-picked claims from politicians, non-experts, and media headlines as the basis of your scientific (sic) understanding of global environmental degradation makes you look ridiculous.

Original thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/de4ino/the_science_is_settled/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Science is never settled, yes, but the reality of global environmental degradation is as settled as the science could possibly be; in fact, it is as settled as the link between cigarettes and lung/cardiovascular diseases (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://whatweknow.aaas.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/whatweknow_website.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjitYeoz4rlAhWCl-AKHa3YATYQFjAAegQIBxAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0L4hcQn4F3gKULSzIH7mn6). But since the nature of science means it may never be ""settled,"" per se, cigarettes may not be bad for you after all so just smoke away, right? What's the harm in 2 packs a day?

The greenhouse gas effect has been established science since the late 1800s. General intellect (as evident by the moon and Venus) and 5th grade science experiments aside (involving some Alka seltzer, a lamp, and two plastic bottles/thermometers), the consensus of 97%+ of climatologists over tens of thousands of academic papers and multi-decadal periods of rigorous analysis, is that anthropogenic GHG emissions are driving global warming. Period. From 1965-1969 7 total academic papers predicted global cooling compared to 42 predicting warming. SEVEN. Since then, our understanding of the science has improved dramatically, as we see in scientific institutions like the NAS, and their perspective of not having a ""good quantitative understanding of our climate machine"" (1975) to now shifting to ""there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occuring"" after studies on the subject (which were consensus at the time of the ""global cooling"" Time magazine headline, anyway) have grown from a few dozen to tens of thousands. Additionally, it takes only a fraction of advanced thought to understand the nuance to these sorts of things like ""climate predictions"". For example, RCP 4.5 assumes radiative forcing stabilization by 2100, but there are literally billions of other variables that could alter the predictions inherent therein over time. Most modern climate models are likewise overly conservative anyway as 1) they depend on the most conservative scenarios for radiative forcing 2) most take no account of negative feedback loops, like the (potential) Dragon's Breathe methane feedback from melting Siberian permafrost 3) they are built off of historical data, and as we deviate further and further from the mean the models could potentially become more and more out-of-touch (conservatively) and 4) many of them now assume mass adoption of widely deployable, cost-effective, and highly productive carbon capture technology that doesn't even exist yet.

This is real, and it is happening. And it's not just warming either. It is important that people understand this, so, instead of posting a meme of easily refuted denialist talking points from the Heritage Foundation, I'll post a list of scientifically verifiable summaries and backups of what we know below for interested readers to explore at their leisure, and would further advise everyone to read much, MUCH more about these issues from the gargantuan amounts of publicly available information from other sources that is out there online, or available through a small subscription payment to a more reliable source, like Nature Mag, or Science Mag.

The planet is warming, and CO2 levels are growing at an unprecedented rate. We have already warmed ~0.9°C since the late 19th century with most of that warming taking place in the last 35 years alone. Ice sheets ARE melting, the hydrological cycle IS changing, and our normal seasonality and other items like the jet stream and overturning circulation ARE changing.

The fossil fuel industry needs labor to continue operating. Employee reacquisition costs are steep. Many employees remain in these industries not because they love working in oil and gas, but because they have little lateral career mobility. 

Idea: create a non-profit that provides funding incentives to workers to encourage them to quit. Essentially provide workers with severance pay to help them find other jobs and undermine the fossil fuel industry. Has anyone tried this?

\- Do you prefer taking the car because sometimes it is faster than public transports ?

\- Do you continue to eat no seasonal fruits/vegetables and importing them for example from spain, south america etc ?

\- Do you still prefer your big brands like LVM GUCCI ARMANI ?

\- Do you still prefer to use a car which uses oil instead of electricity ?

\- Do you still buy on the net which most of the online companies use planes and cargo boats to deliver your goods ?

Well budies what i see is that most of us are asking for changes but we will not accept that those things listed above will change. So how can you say that you want to fight climate change if most of you would not accept to change what's above ? Because going to green energies will not solve most of those issues because it will not be enough to sustain our energetic needs. 

The fact that most of us say that we are climate activists but when asked to change those habits most refuse... It's disgusting and it's the reality. That's the reason most of the politics refused to address the climate change issue. We have habits and comforts and we will refuse to give up on them.

to solve the climate change issue it is certain that we will have to diminish our living conditions and our comfort but will you accept it ?

What disgusts me about human nature is that there are lots of people dying of hunger in the world while 1 bilion $ per year could solve the issue. but we never considered it an issue however when the world is changing and people begin to have fear for their own asses and their future children we begin to do something... Humans are just individualistic assholes they care for themselves and their private relatives only pets included.Something that disgusts me about human nature lies in the question of climate change."

0,"The international media strongly prefers to cover rich environmentalists and telegenic greenwashed celebrities over poor environmentalists and people with track records that caused trouble to industrialists.

Coverage of the Gilets Jaunes was heavily spiked by this issue, because the Gilets Jaunes rebelled against regressive fuel taxes.  Transferring some of the fuel taxes from cars to airplanes would have helped greatly in mollifying them, and had it been done early, that might have prevented the protests outright.  Was coverage of the Gilets Jaunes talking about their stated demands for airplane fuel taxes?  Faintly, yes!  I noticed that message from afar, and so I cannot honestly say that the message was never transmitted at all.  Yet was there a major effort organized by the jet-set crowd to take down international fuel tax bans and create a new, fairer world order?  None at all!

The problem is that airplane taxes tend to upset the media-class and their greenwashed celebrities.  These are people who fly constantly.  They do not want to pay more taxes.  They believe themselves already the whole pillars holding up civilization; why should they pay still more in taxes while the slothful, slovenly, detestable unwashed masses do not?  So it is that greenwashed celebrities are not ideal environmentalists.  Yet the media requires that we remain dependent on them; there are only a few outlets that reach deep into the less telegenic parts of the world to draw forth stories from people who lack the prominence to be heard.  (National Geographic does some good work around the world making the unheard stories audible.)  We need to do far more of that.  To achieve environmentalist ends, we must be drawing people up from beneath in our society.

For an environmentalism that must always kowtow to industrialists and which can only exalt its least useful, most hypocritical people is an environmentalism that works poorly and looks terrible.  If rich people live expensive, high-emissions lives, why do we not pave wide new roads whereby we can recruit into our governments people who simply are not rich when they enter?  People without dependencies on the luxuries of the elite could give environmentalism a far more honest and earthy representation.

Changing this means giving prestige and fame to people who the media believes ""don't deserve it"" - because they aren't famous already, because they upset the kind of people who are willing and able to purchase messages against good causes, or because they approve of policies that might disrupt the operations of the media and its pet celebrities, like airplane fuel taxes.  Yet the media's standards of deserving have exalted only environmentalists who flail before the charges of hypocrisy; the media's desires that they should be pinning to the sky only perfect personalities is at odds with actual success and integrity in this movement.  The media in recent years has struggled to make environmentalism look like anything but the pet cause of rich hypocrites.

An environmentalism built only of pretty and well-connected people will float above the clouds until the world burns beneath.  We need environmentalists who know how to stand upon the ground with the rest of us.The Gilets Jaunes and Eco-Regressivist Media Coverage"

* Montreal, Canada - 500,000
* Berlin, Germany - 270,000
* New York City, USA - 260,000
* Rome, Italy - 200,000
* Milan, Italy - 150,000

* Hamburg, Germany - 100,000
* Madrid, Spain - 100,000
* Manchester, UK - 100,000
* Melbourne, Australia - 100,000
* London, UK - 100,000
* San Francisco, USA - 100,000
* Vancouver, Canada - 100,000

Another couple of interesting facts I found:

* As  a whole country, New Zealand had the largest percentage of population join the various marches, with 170,000 attendees or 3.5% of the population.
* Belarus had one brave lone protester, Veronica Yanovich.

The history of these broad-leaved forests dates back 25 to 50 million years, when they covered most of this Northern Temperate region. These ancient forest areas retreated during the Quaternary glaciations and then expanded again as the climate became milder. Their floristic biodiversity is remarkable: 44% of the vascular plants known in Iran are found in the Hyrcanian region, which only covers 7% of the country. To date, 180 species of birds typical of broad-leaved temperate forests and 58 mammal species have been recorded, including the iconic Persian Leopard (*Panthera pardus tulliana*).

Today, my father me sent this video and said CO2 is not the cause for climate change. I told him the vast majority of the scientific community says climate change IS caused by man, but he said it’s a conspiracy. He said CO2 gas is not toxic, and the stuff about carbon tax and measures to decrease CO2 emissions is bullshit. Is there some sort of evidence to show how overwhelming the signs of global warming are?

You don’t have to see the videos (I didn’t, because I really don’t think it’s worth my time).

As I was changing the 6 month old last week I thought about all the disposable diapers I had gone through the short 6 months. Diapers on average take about 500 years to decompose, this worried me even more. I started to do some research on the different options parents have when it comes to diapers. While there are numerous brands on the market, cloth and disposable were the two main types. Many parents who are conscious of the environment might believe that cloth diapers are the way to go but in truth its not really helping the environment that much at all. Cloth diapers are reusable and gentle on sensitive skin. Disposable diapers usually have dyes that irritate the baby's skin and they are not bio-degradable. From here the question is cost, how much are you paying for the first 2 years of a babies life on diapers? For cloth diapers it can run you anywhere from 800-1000 USD for cloth and 2000-3000 for disposable. The catch is, cloth diapers need to be washed daily, every couple days or weekly. The amount of energy and electricity it takes to wash them this many times might make the cost between the two equal. If you give your diapers to a laundry service it might surpass the cost of disposable. Some positive news is that more bio-degradable diapers are hitting the market. Hopefully it will become the new normal in years to come.Cloth vs. Disposable Diapers"

0,"I'm not quite sure where to post this, but I have to get it off my chest. It is all so, so, so much more worse than people think. 

I work as a biologist/project manager for a large state agency. My (way too small) team oversees hazardous site cleanup, OPA and CERCLA, from the initial spill through remediation and monitoring. We partner with a lot of fed and state agencies, academia, and NGOs which means I get to work with some very smart people who know what they're doing. In many cases they are some of the original researchers.

0,"I was recently looking at some data about agg emissions and I came across [this UVM article about energy use in agriculture](https://learn.uvm.edu/foodsystemsblog/2014/07/10/meat-vs-veg-an-energy-perspective/) and when you look at the energy cost of producing/packing/distributing/etc meat OR plant based agg, there isn't a whole lot of difference between them.

 &gt;The energy intensity of fruit and vegetables in the US might surprise some, but it shouldn’t; modern fruit and vegetable farming systems are highly industrialized, relying on vast monocultures, fertilizers, pesticides, and tillage practices that require heavy machinery and plenty of fuel. While grain is less energy intensive than other foods, it is relatively devoid of easily absorbed nutrients and provides little more than empty calories. At the national level, there appears to be little meaningful difference between the energy intensity of animal-derived foods relative to fruits and vegetables.

This really got me thinking: why the hell are we not discussing the per-calorie ""cost"" of the food we eat? 

In theory, food A could be 2x as costly in terms of carbon to produce than food B, but provide 4x the caloric benefit. In this sense, food A would still be our better choice in terms if GHG impact. 

I would be very curious to see a study done that includes calories in the GHG equation.Why are we not discussing the per-calorie emission cost of food production?"

0,"Now to start off i think that this is important to say, despite whatever a 15 year old says at the U.N., governments cant just legislate the problem out of existence tomorrow. These environmental issues today didn't just appear because some people started being greedy, it predominately came about as we became more successful.

Its important to understand that all generations have inherited problems they have to solve because at no point in human history did we achieve an earthy Utopian paradise with all problems solved. We solve the things in front of us and try to do our best with the new things that appear. In the 1900s for example they banned the harmful use of Tetraethyllead in gasoline while making sure that companies had enough time to innovate and find better alternatives. That was the right approach because it tackled the problem but did so in a way that didn't deprive us of the benefits that the chemicals provided for us. This is an important principal and here's why.

It might not mean much to most because they don't have a good concept of it but our recent ancestors lived in grinding poverty in nearly every country across the world. Less than 200 years ago the world was pretty heavily divided into a poor world and a rich world with most of the planet living in extreme poverty. That meant that people died young, disease was rampant, crime and lawlessness was the rule. However as we began to solve these problems the human population began to grow like it never had before. In the 50 years before the 1970's we doubled from 2 billion to 4. During this time many people predicted that there would be mass starvation as we stripped our resources but we showed that technical innovation could increase the carrying capacity of the planet and we could become highly efficient in catering to our needs. In the last century we reduced absolute poverty by more than half and we now have a world that fits on a bell curve, with the vast majority in the middle and gradually moving further and further in the right direction. 

Now here we are, and we've learned that we have to deal with the consequences of our immense success. The current problem we have to solve is we have to find ways to reduce environmental damage without putting the the economic gains that increase the bell curve at risk. Already within the last 2 decades we've began making significant progress in developing cleaner energy sources through innovation that was driven by the markets financial intensives. They've even began to compete in the market and replace the established technologies that had significant negative environmental impact.

The most important step forward now would be to completely depoliticize the issue. We love to think that we examine the evidence and then come to our conclusions but the problem is that the issue now falls along political lines. Unfortunately humans adopt beliefs form their peer groups and use or ignore information to rationalize their ideas. This is part of the reason climate and environmental issues have become so difficult is because these issues require consensus and that's something your not going to get by politicizing it. Human beings are inherently tribal, ""us vs. them"" has been the most powerful rallying cry in history and while it may have kept us alive at some point, it's outdated. 

Moving forward everyone should ignore anyone that tries to make it an ""us vs them"" issue and focus on encouraging and supporting the innovators and inventors that create the new sustainable technologies. Eventually they will phase out the damaging technologies and practices and become the new industry standards.How did we get here and what should be our next step on the environmental problems that face us?"

0,"In the recent months a proposal has been granted for a new Ferrochrome plant to be build in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, Canada. This plant will produce 110 tons of emission per year will be released into the air. These airborne emissions will contain chromium 6 (despite the measures employed by Outukumpu), as well as nickel, lead and vanadium. 20,000 tonnes per year of contaminated waste will need to be dumped somewhere. Probably it will end up in tailing ponds. Predictably these will leak and some amount of chromium 6 will end up in the groundwater, just a matter of how much. 167 trucks per day carrying slag, waste and Ferrochrome across the international border, over the St. Mary's river. This plant will be needing 24 million cubic meters of water per year. Which will most likely be getting that resource from the river and dumping it back out to flow into all of the Great Lakes. Sault Ste Marie is the main connection port for Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. If this plant gets built it will be devastating for the environment , and for the near 100,000 people living in it's shadow.

0,"Hello
My name is **** and I am a student at the university of Saskatchewan and have always been a large supporter of Tim Hortons. However, I have been witnessing a practice that has left me frustrated. Like many people today, I am trying to be more conscious of my carbon footprint and the amount of waste I am putting into the environment. One way I try to do this is by refusing plastic cups and using a reusable coffee cup whenever purchasing a drink. Over the past few weeks, I picked up on the fact that Tim Hortons employees use a plastic cup to make ice coffee, then dump it into the reusable cup and throw the plastic into the trash. I would assume this is to make sure that they are only pouring the correct amount, but for the consumer it is frustrating to see that even when using a reusable cup, the same amount of plastic is being thrown out. Since noticing this, I have seen it happen every time I attempt to use my reusable cup to get an ice coffee for the past 3 weeks. I would like to see a change in this procedure, for example using a measuring cup that is not thrown away and can be washed between uses. I believe that everyone has a part to play in reducing waste, and the practice of using plastic to dump into reusable cups is hindering Canadians ability to cut single use plastic out of a easy everyday purchase. Please make a change and help reduce the single use plastic that is ending up in our oceans. 

Thank youI wrote a strongly worded message to Tim Hortons and hope sharing it here will help get their attention!"
0,"My friend and I happened to be in Tokyo during the climate strike and so we joined in theirs while we were there.  
It was pretty absurd at first because it happened at 5pm... Yes, a work/school strike that begins after work/school.  


Once we got past the weirdness and joined in, it became immediately apparent that Japan didn't have a very large base of people that were particularly concerned about this. Of course, part of that might be the language/cultural barrier, which means they are more likely to organise their own protests than jump on the back of world protests, but I probably shouldn't have been too surprised. We were, after all, in a country where many things sold are triple-wrapped in plastic and then handed over in a plastic bag. Not to mention all the coffee shops we saw where all the customers were sitting indoors, drinking from disposable coffee cups.  


Mind-you, as far as I'm aware, they do a good job with their CO2 emissions, so I'm probably focussing on the small issues. Also, I'm relatively new to understanding these issues, so I'm not the best person to pass judgement. Nevertheless, once it kicked off, a huge number of people joined in. It was by no means anywhere near the numbers seen in other countries around the world, but it certainly wasn't fruitless.  


It was odd how we had to wait for traffic and it took a while for the politeness of the Japanese culture to wear off enough for the chants to get going, but once it did, the march was great! It gained quite a bit of attention and it turned out that we were marching through rush hour, going through one of the busiest crosswalks in Japan, in the city of Shibuya.

0,"Now don't get me wrong. The situation is dire. It's important face all of the factual information and not put our heads in the sand about it.

But complaining about Trump, complaining about Brazil, the evil oil companies, the billionaire oligarchy, blah blah blah. It's not helping us. There are so, so many people who understand the gravity of the situation and are ready to take action. If you're reading this, you're probably one of those people.

All of the complaining is just a distraction. It doesn't do anything. Do you think the oil executives have hurt feelings because a bunch of people are saying about how evil they are? They don't. Do you think the people running think tanks generating climate denialist propaganda feel sad at night because people are accusing them of destroying the planet? They don't. Do you think your average Joe Trump supporter is worried that you think he's stupid? He's not.

Here's what can possibly make a difference, if anything can. You have a circle of influence. Your professional network, social network, local, state and federal elected representatives, etc. Do whatever you can to create change within that circle. And also do everything you possibly can to expand your circle. Focus on the highest leverage, bang for your buck things you can do. Can you plant a tree and do meatless Mondays? Fine. Can you get your church or college to plant a forest garden? Even better. Can you coordinate a political campaign to unseat your apathetic congressional representative (or senator!) and replace them for someone who's on fire for the green new deal? Better still. Start where you are, do the best thing you can think of, and learn as you go.

Complaining is a low-leverage action. It takes up a lot of emotional energy and doesn't get us anywhere. So many of us care so deeply and yet we are sticking to low leverage responses to the situation ... it pretty much ensures our demise. It's what the oil executives are counting on. The propaganda isn't just to convince climate denialists, it's also to distract the rest of us and channel our energy into impotent rage.

0,"Can someone help me?  Has there been studies on the effect of roof structures on earth in terms of global warming?  To me, carbon and other products in our atmosphere is one thing, and may contribute.  But if you just look at these quick calculation and think about it in terms of common sense, it seems the number of people and covering those people with roof structures would contribute way more to global warming than anything else. Roofs are generally heat absorbing and building vast suburbs or housing from what once was trees multiplies the effect by remove trees and natural habitat that can deal with the heat from the sun (and trees that removed carbon).  

In 1970 the population on earth was 3.7 billion.  If they occupied 45 sq meters per person it would require 166.5 billion sq meters of roofing.  

In 2019 the world population is 7.7 billion.  And home sizes are larger so perhaps we now occupy 50 sq meters per person. that would be 385 billion sq meters of roofing! More than double.  

Now this doesn't account for multiple levels and certain places perhaps the homes are much smaller like in China  but still there is no doubt built structures occupy way more than it used to. I don't even account for additions for roofing in work places, grocery stores, etc all things that come with more people.  

You can cut carbon all you want if you don't deal with population explosion we're in big trouble.  Plus I noticed in 1950 the world population was 2.5 billion, so it took 20 years to go up 1.2 billion but from 2010 we were at 6.9 billion and went to 7.7 billion in just 9 years an increase of .8 billion. That is quite scary and no amount of cutting anything is going to help.  People aren't going to freeze to death, they'll burn anything they can get their hands on causing even more carbon to be released even if you cut everything.Climate Change: Effect of housing or really growth in roof structures"

Nanoparticles enter the body from breathing the air, or from eating food and water where they enter directly into the bloodstream, and also by passage through the skin. They also have the potential to penetrate the blood–brain barrier due to their small size. Nanoparticles can interact with proteins and enzymes, alter gene expression, and thus affect the biological behavior at the organ, tissue, cellular, sub-cellular, and protein levels.

Nanoparticles affect fish and move up the food chain. Scientists think that nanoparticles cling to certain types of proteins the fish need to transport fats through their bloodstream. They found clear indications of a decrease in the burning of fats in the fish, which supports this hypothesis. As seen with environmental toxins such as DDT, heavy metals and hormone suppressants, it’s long been known that toxins can be carried up the food chain and accumulate in animals atop the pyramid. This is the first study showing nanoparticles passing up links in the food chain in the same way.

After crossing the blood brain barrier, nanoparticles have a tendency to accumulate in specific brain regions, where they can access the neural cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.

The neurotoxicity of nanoparticles is usually caused by the extensive production of reactive oxygen species that lead to oxidative stress. Subsequently, the release of cytokines causes neuroinflammation, and finally, through apoptotic mechanisms, neuronal death. Many of the commonly used nanoparticles, including titanium dioxide nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and carbon-based nanoparticles, have been reported as potentially neurotoxic materials.

Iron oxide nanoparticles reach the brain by crossing the blood brain barrier, or through the olfactory nerve, which affects synaptic transmissions and nerve conduction, causing neural inflammation, apoptosis, induced neural antioxidant responses, and immune cell infiltration.

Gold nanoparticles reach the brain through the olfactory nerves and by crossing the blood brain barrier. In the latter case, gold nanoparticles might cause three types of severe neurological pathologies: astrogliosis, also known as reactive astrocytosis, characterized by an increased number of astrocytes that is caused by the death of adjacent neurons, which leads to scar formation and the inhibition of axon regeneration, increased seizure activity, defined as any change in the electrical activity of the brain, and cognition defects, such as attention, memory, and judgement impairments.

Silica nanoparticles can reach the brain intranasally and leads to cognitive dysfunction and impairment, but also to pathologies that are similar to neurodegeneration and synaptic changes. 

Carbon nanoparticle inhalation leads to accumulation in the olfactory bulb, inducing an inflammatory response by activating the microglial cells.

Does anyone know why we should listen to Greta Thunberg?  I am uneducated on this subject, so I want to know what gives her the validity to have an audience?  Does she have any formal education on environmental science?  I know a formal education isn’t necessary, especially on a subject simply concerned with the well-being of our planet, but I think it is a question that should be asked: does she know what she is talking about?  I feel like most people have the answer to this because she has quite an audience, but I just have not found any answers where I have searched, so I would appreciate any information.
Thanks!Why listen to Greta Thunberg?"
0,"Since the widespread engagement of social media there has occurred a shift in how the anthropogenic climate change issue has been pitched to the general public. I think that isn't unique to this issue, but rather indicative of a more broad conceptual shift in civil discourse. A constant barrage of emotional triggers during our daily consumption of social media has resulted in moral conviction that I would argue was not as extreme in 1990s and early 2000s western society. Popular narratives are now given as absolutes. In my opinion, the assumptions we hold bout certain issues shape the outcomes of the solutions to those issues. It frames how we view solutions.

The climate change debate is interesting to me because the popular narrative has been highly politicized and highly propagandized. How the issue has been penned in modern discourse tends to espouse one, or all, of the following assumptions:

\- Antagonist: Fossil fuel companies who value profit over life.

\- Antagonist: Political figures who allow emissions to increase.

\- Antagonist: Rich people

\- Protagonist: Poor people

\- Protagonist: Environment

\- Protagonist: YOU - if you can help.

I think that this popular conceptualization of the issue is very smart, because it really encourages people to at least nominally support the narrative as an act of moral virtue. By framing this in terms of protagonist/antagonist - and by providing a face to the antagonist - peoples' voting behaviour in particular can be really influenced.

However, I think this is a fundamentally wrong way to think about the issue. Fossil fuel consumption is a reality in our world due to our current technology. Fossil fueled powered technologies have ushered in literally the most prosperous epoch in the entire history of humanity. In the last 15 years, global abject poverty has effectively halved. Global GDP growth in poorer nations are at full speed and inertia - agricultural output is up - starvation is at record lows.

Those fossil fuel companies exist to provide that cheap and available source of energy to people who want to buy them. Those political figures generally are very reluctant to put hard caps on emissions - or taxes high enough to encourage that - because of the inevitably enormous fall out from lowering the overall welfare of their populace. Poor people disproportionately benefit from fossil fuels - especially in the developing world where fossil fuel power is lifting them out of poverty. Therefore, emissions likely will not diminish to any meaningful degree so long as fossil fuels are the cheapest and most reliable option.

This opens up some legitimately important topics of discussion. Such as - what would be the perfect mix of a pigovian tax on carbon, and tax write offs for renewables industries, to provoke that change without lowering GDP? What are ways we can utilize market forces to encourage the change most expeditiously? 

I think that the popular espousing of a class warfare worldview, or an antagonist/protagonist narration, has politicized this issue to the point where it has become conflated with partisan politics. It has prevented people from working together politically to create a solution to the problem - which will almost certainly have to involve major corporations in conjunction with global governments. Far more would be accomplished if we focused on lowering the price point of renewables, than if we simply continued down the path of partisan politics concerning climate change, based on faulty assumptions. This goes for the left and the right.Are we framing climate change the right way?"

0,"Hi r/environment

I'd like to share something with you, and encourage you to share it. I'm an astrophysicist, studying the dynamics of bodies moving under gravity.

I may have a plausible ""solution"" for climate change - a way to stop global temperature rise, within the current economic culture.

It's not a perfect solution, it may not even be feasible - but it seems worth exploring, and as a single actor I don't have the voice or the power alone to develop it.

I invite you to have a read of the below thread - I'm happy to answer any questions - and I really appreciate anyone who shares it or can advise me on how best to communicate it to those with the power, knowledge and interest to pursue it.

A little back story - I have been going basically beef free for a few years now, but didn't really 'come out' until earlier this year. So I have gotten a ton of the ""ya well you are wrong"" types coming out of the wood work. I'm used to it in general, but it is frustrating after a while as it seems to come up every time...

I believe it's an ecosystem based arguement. (shocker, when I ask for specifics ""it was in an article I saw, google that article"") I'm guessing the thought is 100 acres of cows grazing is better then 100 acres of corn fields.Can anyone debunk 'grass fed beef is better for the environment then going vegetarian'?"

How I started explaining how fast things are changing in the last 200 years which differs from these natural cycle changes over millennium or more.

We argued for a bit and it was civil, but I would like a well written and thought out source which describes what is happening all laid out in front of you.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been having discussions with my dad about climate change, and his main issue with climate change is ""I've been through the doomsday preaching before, and nothing happened by the dates they said it would happen so why should I believe it now?"". We've been through how there is overwhelming evidence that climate change is occurring and how academic peer-reviewed research is a much more substantial source of evidence than editorialized articles from non scientific dissenters (like those who say it's a campaign to undermine the government or that people are crying wolf), but I'm wondering how you all would guide that conversation? 

&amp;#x200B;

ThanksQuestion regarding defense of climate change"
0," 

Having a Degree in Geography and Archeology i studied climatology, environment and archeozoology many times here is what we learnt that you may perhaps not know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm no climatoskeptic however many people just don't understand realities and the political and economical issues behind this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all most of the medias and organisations say that global warming is a consequence of our anthropic activities which is not totally true just partially.

&amp;#x200B;

Earth exists since 4,53 billion years and during its existence it always had cycles. One of them is the Glaciation and interglacial cycle which repeats itself approximatively each 100'000 years. Each time earth cools istelf during glaciation and it allows the renewal of ice and glaciers.

&amp;#x200B;

After the period of glaciation, happens an interglacial period. During those periods earth warms itself temperatures get higher and levels of CO2 too.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cg7k5nveatn31.jpg

So this hapenned many times in the past however scripture was not invented yet because mankind was still primitive. Because we have no records of it we don't know what really happened during those times and how the climate change will affect us. We know that populations were forced to migrate and we saw in archeozoology that many species like the wolly Rhinoceros or the european lion disappeared because of climate change : here you can see that wiki evoques climate change for its extinction [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly\_rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_rhinoceros)

&amp;#x200B;

Want it or not global warming is a natural phenomenum and we will never be able to stop it because it's a natural mecanism which allows earth to proceed the renewal of its ice stock. During those cycles many species disappear and go exctinct and many new species appear. Mankind survived because of its intelligence it allowed our specie to adapt faster to the climate changes and to survive despite many losses in population numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

So why are many people in the scientific community freaking out about the phenomenum ? well we know that we are actually in an interglacial period. More specifically we are at the end of an interglacial period. Worse even the period of glaciation which should follow is 100 years late according to some people in the scientific community.

&amp;#x200B;

We know that temperatures always followed levels of CO2 :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bmcmm3ukatn31.jpg

First of all you can see that the levels of CO2 have already been high during the past and this was supposedely due to volcanism (we still don't really know what happened it's still very hypothetical).

&amp;#x200B;

However you can see that the actual levels of CO2 are extremely high compared to the past. The scientific community which is really studying this subject is worried about it because we don't know how it will affect the interglacial glaciation transition.

&amp;#x200B;

The transition should be slower than what is actually happening. In fact the levels of CO2 just **accelerate and strenghten** a natural phenomenum which is global warming. Its acceleration means that events will be stronger and faster instead of evolving at ""acceptable"" levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we didn't produced 0 amount of CO2 countries and cities would anyways be under water and fires would occur more frequently. Temperature would rise too. Even if we didn't produced CO2 many species will die because of this earth's cycle. I know that many of us fear for our environment and we all love many animals. But its nature and nature isn't always kind. Over times many species like the cave bear, the wooly rhinoceros, the european lion and many many others disappeared because of climate change. Most of the fauna of the past periods are mostly exctinct. Those who survived were the ones which were able to migrate and to adapt.

&amp;#x200B;

So why if all of this is true why are the medias and some members of governments going hard on global warming ?

&amp;#x200B;

the answer is quite complex, we actually have 2 big geopolitical issues :

&amp;#x200B;

\- Our population is growing exponentially

\- Fossil fuels are disappearing quickly

&amp;#x200B;

Which means that because our populations is growing quickly we will have more energetical needs. However we can't continue to use fossil fuels because they are not eternal. So governments and many institutions are trying to use global warming as a scapegoat to perform energetic transition to renewable energies. The main goal is to use population to make pressure on the energetic lobbies. As our population grows exponentially, we have to quicky find solutions to substitute those fuels. If we do not there will be future wars over the remaining fossil fuels. Because people are more sensitive about nature than about their own specie survival we have to use climate change as a scapegoat. That's a way to make the energetic transition happen =&gt; going from fossil fuels to renewable fuels. Add to this that if we enter a glaciation period without renewable energies most of mankind would be wiped off because we will be not be able to resupply our energetic needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the people supporting the fight against climate change often support renewable energies. However the production of solar pannels, wind turbines, geothermical installations, most of those renewable technologies generate an equal amount of pollution and of CO2. Solar pannels require rare earth which are found mainly in china. those have to be exported then many chemical process have to be done to transform matter. After that you have the baterry issues which pollute a lot. That's a hint that the main issue isn't nature but mostly energetical subsistance.

When europe announced the diesel ban many people went crazy about the changes. So yes energetic transition is going to be difficult and if we don't use the nature and global warming argument no one will move to adapt for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Pollution is another issue. It can be related to climate change but there are forms of pollution which are not linked to climate change like throwing plastics into the ocean. That's more an educational issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Global warming is a natural phenomenum which allows earth to recycle its ice stock. We accelerate it with CO2 however there is nothing we can do to stop it entirely because it's mother nature's cycle, however we can perhaps slow it. Global warming is used by institutions and many members inside green parties to help perform energetic transition.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes its a good thing to continue to make pressure on oil and gas lobbies and on some governments but that will never solve the global warming issue. However you will help the energetical transition and help assure energetical subsistance for mankind in the future.The big missconceptions about Climate Change and Global warming"

0,"We need a common reference point from which to launch debate &amp; climate action. Much impetus is lost in the discord of information that emits from the complex &amp; controversial topic of climate change. Nefarious agendas exploit this discord, governments renege on their commitments, individuals are overwhelmed &amp; disenfranchised.

We need a central resource from which we can unanimously: (1) define &amp; understand the problem, (2) refer to sets of stacked &amp; ranked solutions specific to a domain (country, individual, industry, etc.), (3) reference up-to-date data for debate &amp; climate action, (4) be part of the climate change debate &amp; take action.

We have the data, technology &amp; willpower to drive a marked change in addressing climate change. What we lack is coordination on all of these things. There can be many possible solutions, some more probable than others. Take this fictional story as inspiration:

&gt;*‘ACTION’* was a key initiative created to address climate change. Its goal was to serve as a central authority from which to tackle the issue. It manifested as a 2-page document on the Internet addressed to *‘The People of the Earth’*, but it was more than that. It was a well-designed &amp; well-run initiative that provided a blueprint which became the common reference point for tackling climate change.  
&gt;  
&gt;To achieve such a concise document that was globally accepted as the blueprint for action was a significant undertaking. Its initiation involved the collaboration of scientists &amp; representatives from countries around the world to assimilate &amp; structure all the data, working in close collaboration with data visualisation experts. Its first draft &amp; underlying structure (that remained fairly consistent throughout) consisted of a Problem section &amp; Solution section. Each section provided a concise visual breakdown of the information. In one glance a lay-person could get a comprehensive overview of each section &amp; drill down as necessary.  
&gt;  
&gt;The document was designed to be dynamic. Data (with its associated degree of certainty) driving the visual information was updated as new information came in. The initiative took advantage of crowd-sourcing that allowed for some of the best minds to contribute via online discussion channels. This allowed relevant insights from individuals &amp; groups to bubble up to the surface &amp; update the document accordingly.  
&gt;  
&gt;What was transformative about *'ACTION'* was that it became the go-to reference document from which to launch discussion &amp; action. Its inception was supported by governments but its operation was independent of them. It empowered everyone with data. From providing solutions for improving efficiencies on an individual level to pressuring governments &amp; companies on higher levels, the actions made towards addressing climate change gained significant *momentum*. In addition, everyone could see almost in *real-time* how their efforts were making a difference.

We have all the ingredients for such a document:

* A place to put it (the Internet)
* Enough data to describe the problem &amp; array of solutions
* The ability to create rich data visualisations (Egs. stock portfolios on a time axis, sophisticated types of data visualisations)
* A prototype, various wonderful web platforms such as Wikipedia
* Various international bodies behind climate change that could spearhead its creation
* A person that can drive it’s acceptance, namely Greta Thunberg, brandishing it as: **“Here is the action plan, you no longer have any excuses!”**
* A world of people wanting to make a difference

What this document would need to be successful in its objective (to be the go-to blueprint for the climate change effort):

* Accessible to everyone
* Quick &amp; easy to understand, navigate &amp; reference
* Exhaustive in containing all (or most of) the data but concise in only presenting data that’s significant (Eg. graphically representing the ‘Top 10’ with an option to drill down further)
* Accurate, legitimate &amp; up-to-date (this includes the sets of ranked solutions)
* Drawn up by eligible respected scientists, possibly in a crowd-sourced manner allowing a global resource of the best minds to contribute

A form of coordination is needed to lock down the climate change debate &amp; mobilise action. We have the data that proves there’s a problem &amp; can *illuminate* the issue further by highlighting where big parts of the problem lie. We have proposed solutions with their associated aspects like cost &amp; impact that change over time. We have burgeoning technologies that can evolve to potentially solve the problem. We have the technology to coordinate people. All we need now is a sanctioned common framework that can drive **coordination**.Coordination - the catalyst to drive climate action"

0,"Hi there!

I feel rather lost and trying to get differnet opinions to make the best decision.

I got accepted to a Master in International Nature Conservation recently. It seemed like a great opportunity to advance my career and reach my goal to protect our planet and the life it inhabits. However, since this Masters is international, it requires me to travel from Germany to New Zealand for a Semester. First, I thought: ""What a unique opportunity"" and ""I'll always wanted to go to New Zealand."". Now I am in doubt, however.

I am living vegan, use public transport and bike rather than car, buy board-games (one of my hobbies) mostly second hand, stick to sustainable brands, share a flat rather than living on my own, join protests and much more. After calculating the amount of CO2 I would emit, when flying to New Zealand, I was in shock. How could it be that one return flight emits more CO2 than one average person in Germany?

I decided to not fly for leisure or short distance anymore, a while ago. But now I am also starting to think: can I really do this trip to New Zealand? Isn't that hypocritic of me? Or does the long term benefit of my travel maybe outweigh the short-term cost? After all international experience is important in the conservation sector, it is my dream to protect our planet and wildlife, and I know what I do is important. I will also definetly get involved in conservation projects in New Zealand. I even tried to find an alternative way by land and sea to get to New Zealand. The costs are huge and there aren't many options. That I only have 7 days between my semester in Germany ends and the one in New Zealand starts, does not make it any better.

I know there are other Masters out there too. I spend the whole last year trying to figure out which one to do, and this one was the best option (back then I didn't think about the CO2 I would emit by travling to New Zealand). Not taking this Master would mean that I would spend another year delaying my education.

I am just so lost at the moment, and tearing up because of the pressure which comes from ever side. Being environmental, living my life, my career . I just don't know what the right decision is anymore. I know noone can decide for me. But having others opinion might help.

Thanks in advance guys!Should I drop my Master because I have to fly?"

0,"In a reality where there is a huge communicational challenge to convince people of the severity of the climate crisis, why are all media, IPCC, and all other (governmental) bodies communicating average temperatures in global warming, instead of land surface warming?

We should not say: “The Paris goal is to forestall warming of 2°C”. We should say “The Paris goal is to forestall warming of 4°C”. Both are true. The former is average sea surface warming. The latter the average land warming which will do most direct damage to us and all biomes relevant for our survival.

Land temperature changes are 50% greater in the U.S. than ocean temperature changes; two to three times greater in Eurasia and three to four times greater in the (Ant)Arctic.

Of course, this is not saying IPCC numbers are wrong or that they are intentionally downplaying global warming. I am just saying that – the scientists they are? - from a communications perspective, they are doing a very bad job.Media and IPCC are communicating numbers too low: Land warming is most relevant and what we usually are talking about, and it is double the average warming.

0,"It’s great that school kids are doing protests but well it’s a shame the adults are letting them do all of it alone. I believe a lot of adults do want to do more but can’t because most people can’t take time off work to protest.

What if we picked a day for everyone around the world to protest by turning off their computer and mobile phone for two hours around 10am in their own country. If possible don’t drive either for 2 hours. You could still stay in work and do other things but just doing that by shutting off, it would have a huge impact alone. People at home could do it too, possibly even have the radio and T.V off too.

Maybe some people will be allowed to go outside and do a real protest for a couple of hours but for those who can’t, they can still make their voices heard. It is kind of like Earth hour but in the middle of the work day specifically for the purpose of protesting.

I'm talking about a World Wide protest that everyone would be able to join into and would be a huge disruption. Two hours stoppage of browsing facebook, Amazon, Instagram, texting on Whatsapp, Reddit, Youtube all at once. Two hours not doing computer work. Two hours not showing up at the gas station or shops. Two hours no radio play or T.V's. The impact on advertisers would be massive. There is no bigger protest than hitting the people in charge where it hurts most, right in their pockets. Everyone joining in together it could be a really cool event, even if it was only one hour. Everyone at once damn that would be huge. People could really tell them how they feel but not have to leave work if that is out of the question for them.Protesting for Climate Change"

We stayed in a research camp run by the Borneo Nature Foundation, a caring group of researchers and locals committed to protecting the peatland forest, its many endangered species and carrying out vital research on this vital ecosystem and the creatures that call it home. A heavy dry season and possibly slash and burn practices to clear space for oil palm have left fires raging through some of the most pristine habitat left in Borneo. The area at risk is home to almost 6000 endangered wild Orangutans and countless other vital species. But another issue lies in the fact that Sabangau lies on dense peatland, meaning that the Co2 levels released by the fires are significantly higher than other forest fires. As a human aspect, the local City of Palangkaraya is blanketed in smoke, causing horrible respiratory problems for locals who often struggle to afford healthcare. The local firefighters over there are incredibly friendly guys with a deep love for the forest and a solid commitment to protect it. But they are significantly under-resourced and lacking in manpower. A donation of just £25 could buy them respiratory protective gear, £100 could buy longer and more modern firehoses while larger amounts could buy fire patrol boats and other vital equipment. Every donation of even £2-5 could help greatly, i will include a link where you can donate and see what your donations could help to buy. Even spreading this message however you can would be a great help. The Amazon fires are horrible, but here in a smaller area donations could have a real impact and actually have a chance to stop this fire dead in its tracks. Thank you for listening and for any help you can give. Lets kick the shit out of this fire and save us some cute ass Orangutans and Loris.

0,"Cmon guys there is more than 10,000 of us on this app so let’s all make a change. We need to stop littering because the more we litter the more we lose, e.g littering into the ocean, sea life die = murky water,which = if we have a drought and we have to take all of the salt out of the water we wouldn’t be able to because there will be Dead Sea life on the surface. We need to protect our environment so that the next generation can have something to enjoy. Cmon guys make a change.Protect our Environment"
0,"**Introduction**

Climate change, despite still being denied by many, is a well established theory with overwhelming evidence to support it. Climate scientists have been warning governments around the world for decades to take necessary steps to reduce global carbon emissions to avoid climate catastrophe, but so far not enough has been done to combat this major problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Effects of climate change**

The destabilisation of the climate negatively impacts just about every area of life. Below are three areas of life that are being impacted due to climate change:

**1) Ecosystems**

* **Erosion of the coral reef** \- “experts project that 90% of the world’s reefs will be gone by 2050. Coral reefs are among the earth’s most precious natural resources. They harbor a million species and provide food for 500 million people around the world. But warming waters, pollution and overfishing have badly damaged these precious ecosystems; roughly 50 percent of the world’s corals have been lost in just the last 30 years. [http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/](http://www.activist360.co/tag/dr-ruth-gates/)
* **Species extinction** \- “Human-caused climate change appears to have driven the Great Barrier Reef’s only endemic mammal species into the history books, with the Bramble Cay melomys, a small rodent that lives on a tiny island in the eastern Torres Strait, being completely wiped-out from its only known location. It is also the first recorded extinction of a mammal anywhere in the world thought to be primarily due to human-caused climate change.” [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/14/first-case-emerges-of-mammal-species-wiped-out-by-human-induced-climate-change)
* **Toxic red tide** \- ""Florida is having a 10-month streak of toxic red tide. This so-called red tide has killed hordes of marine animals and is entering its 10th month of existence—making it one of the longest-lasting cases documented to date...According to Glibert, there are two key factors contributing to this worldwide shift: increasing nutrient run-off from farms, lawns, and other land-based sources, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns occurring as a result of climate change. [https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/florida-is-having-a-10-month-streak-of-toxic-red-tide-64632)

**2) Social**

* **Water** **shortages**: ""Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought in many parts of the United States and the world in the decades ahead."" [https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/](https://www.c2es.org/content/drought-and-climate-change/)
* **Increased** **nutrient** **deficiency**: “**Climate** **change** will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient. Crops grown in a high CO2 atmosphere are less nutritious, containing less protein, zinc and iron” [https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient)
* **Increased** **risk** **of** **diseases**: “After West Nile virus kills 22 people in heatwave, experts warn of more mosquito and tick-borne diseases due to climate change...“ [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/23/tropical-disease-outbreaks-are-growing-threat-in-europe-as-temperatures-rise)

**3) Energy**

* **Wind** **turbines** \- “Heatwave knocks wind out of onshore turbines” [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heatwave-knocks-wind-out-of-onshore-turbines-szshw0dvp)
* **Hydropower** **dams** \- ""African nations could face devastating blackouts as rising temperatures dry up their hydropower dams. Based on recent years in which extremely dry conditions saw electricity drop off in large areas, a new report by climate scientists has warned that the trend for dam construction may be misguided.” [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/africa-hydropower-dams-climate-change-drought-renewable-energy-rivers-a8513331.html)
* **Nuclear** **power** \- ""Europe’s heatwave, however, hasn’t just increased air temperatures but also water temperatures. Regulations protecting wildlife mean that the usual water sources drawn on by nuclear plants cannot always be used for cooling, leading to shutdowns. It’s not the first time this has happened: Heatwaves forced nuclear shutdowns or curtailments across Europe in 2003, 2006, and 2015. Worse still, scientists warn that thermal power interruptions will worsen because of climate change—not just because of heatwaves but also droughts. It’s ironic that human-induced climate change is threatening a climate-friendly source of electricity. [https://qz.com/1348969/europes-heatwave-is-forcing-nuclear-power-plants-to-shut-down/](https://qz.com/1348969/europes-heatwave-is-forcing-nuclear-power-plants-to-shut-down/)

&amp;#x200B;

**How can veganism help**

There are many things an individual can do to reduce their carbon footprint, including: have fewer or no children, recycle more, walk, cycle and use public transport more, use automobiles and planes less, use less electricity, and educate others.  
One of the best ways, that is often not talked about, is to go vegan and switch to a plant-based diet.

&gt;“Which diet is best for the environment? **According to the most comprehensive analysis of farming’s impact on the planet, plant-based food is most effective at combatting climate change**. Oxford University researcher Joseph Poore, who led the study, said adopting a vegan diet is “the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth..."" [https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/](https://livekindly.co/eating-vegan-is-the-most-effective-way-to-combat-climate-change-says-largest-ever-food-production-analysis/)

**1) Less water use**

[https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable](https://mercyforanimals.org/animal-agriculture-wastes-one-third-of-drinkable)

* About one-third of the world’s water consumption is for producing animal products.
* According to data from the Pacific Institute and National Geographic, a single egg takes 53 gallons of water to produce, a pound of chicken 468 gallons, a gallon of cow’s milk 880 gallons, and a pound of beef 1,800 gallons.
* Growing crops to feed animals killed for food consumes 56 percent of water in the U.S.
* Animal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world.
* Because animals are so densely packed on today's industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water.
* Tyson, America’s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical.
* Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S.
* One hamburger requires 660 gallons of water to produce—the equivalent of two months’ worth of showers.
* A pound of chicken requires 71 percent more water to produce than a pound of soy.

**2) Less pollution**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones around the world in our oceans. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of ocean dead zones…water pollution. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**3) Less environmental destruction**

* Animal agriculture is responsible for up to 91% of Amazon destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* The meat industry is the cause of 85% of all soil erosion. [https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/faq/how-does-eating-meat-harm-the-environment/)

**4) Less species extinction**

* Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction…and habitat destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)
* Up to 137 plant, animal and insect species are lost every day due to rainforest destruction. [www.cowspiracy.com/facts](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

**5) Less energy waste**

* “In general, each trophic level relates to the one below it by absorbing some of the energy it consumes, and in this way can be regarded as resting on, or supported by, the next lower trophic level. Food chains can be diagrammed to illustrate the amount of energy that moves from one feeding level to the next in a food chain. This is called an energy pyramid. The energy transferred between levels can also be thought of as approximating to a transfer in biomass, so energy pyramids can also be viewed as biomass pyramids, picturing the amount of biomass that results at higher levels from biomass consumed at lower levels. However, when primary producers grow rapidly and are consumed rapidly, the biomass at any one moment may be low; for example, phytoplankton (producer) biomass can be low compared to the zooplankton (consumer) biomass in the same area of ocean” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic\_level#Biomass\_transfer\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_level#Biomass_transfer_efficiency)
* “Th**e ten percent law** of transfer of energy from one trophic level to the next can be attributed to Raymond Lindeman (1942), although Lindeman did not call it a ""law"" and cited ecological efficiencies ranging from 0.1% to 37.5%. According to this law, during the transfer of organic food energy from one trophic level to the next higher level, only about ten percent of the transferred energy is stored as flesh. The remaining is lost during transfer, broken down in respiration, or lost to incomplete digestion by higher trophic level.” - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological\_efficiency#Ten\_percent\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_efficiency#Ten_percent_law)

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**

Climate change is real, human activity has been proven to be a major cause, and there are several things you can do to reduce its impact:

1. Have fewer or no children
2. Recycle more
3. Walk, cycle and use public transport more, and use automobiles and planes less
4. Switch to a plant-based diet
5. Use less electricity
6. Educate others

For many years I designed and built xeriscaped landscapes for residential and small business. 
With all these highly motivated and dedicated environmentalists planting trees these days I just wanted to give some suggestions for success.
#1- Plant native trees! Native trees require little to no irrigation. 
#2- Plant trees away from the foundation of structures and water/sewer lines.
#3- Trees need space! Make sure the type of tree you get, you can maintain. Some trees get really tall and you have to hire people to trim them or they become hazards. 
#4- If you can make sure rain runoff will collect at the base of the tree or the treeline, for better results in arid climates. 

There are many more, so do your research!Tree planting guide for beginners!"
0,"I’m not here to say you can’t eat meat, i personally have a limited diet and can’t eliminate meat from mine.

But I also care about the environment and I think reducing meat consumption is helpful. So here is a pro tip on how to compromise

You can still order you bacon cheeseburger. But instead of getting a double burger with 6 strips of bacon and a small fry, maybe get a single burger with 2 strips and a large fry. Congratulations, you have exchanged meat for plants without changing much. 

There you made a difference without making a change! Now go enjoy you mealsReducing meat in your diet doesn’t have to mean no more bacon cheeseburgers"

I'm all for nuclear, wind, solar, co2 capturing technology, and so forth. I know most environmentalists don't want nuclear due to possible Chernobyl crisis, which is valid, but it rare that it happens. Other than nuclear warheads why not invest in nuclear power plants to be able to lean ourselfs from coal and other fossil fuel? Then invest in electric car technology that it becomes more affordable. The only major hitter is tesla. I'm a nuclear guy but we can't put all our eggs in one basket thus is why I mention wind and co2 capturingMy opinion which most probably disagree"

What I am currently doing is:

-	Vermicomposting
-	Buying used clothes and electronics (used clothes are coming from a local store that supports domestic violence victims)
-	Eating more vegan meat (cutting most of my actual meat consumption to 1 day a week (not counting eggs), only eating chicken)
-	Buying anything I can locally, organically (I live in BC, Canada so this is fairly easy)
-	Recycling (my own recycling plus anything I can take from my job that’s recyclable (with managers permission)
-	I don’t drive, I walk or take public transit if I have to (don’t have a full license) 
-	BC gets 95% of energy from hydroelectricity
-	Impose my own carbon tax on myself when buying from Amazon or eBay (with carbon emissions)
-	I do not have AC in my house (I use fans) 
-	Using dish soap, laundry soap, and body wash that isn’t made with harsh chemicals)

And is extended to all the Chaco region, killing a lot animals and destroying everything in its path.

The scenario is hopeless, because the people most of them volunteer that are in the Chaco helping are not receiving any help from the government.

0,"A couple days ago Yemen's Houthis launched an attack on Saudi Arabia's biggest oil facility, potentially shutting down large parts of its capacity.  Trump's administration is now threatening war with Iran by citing this attack on our favorite tyranny's oil wealth.  However this specific episode plays out, Trump &amp; co's candor about the purpose of US involvement in the middle east should be illustrative of a much larger trend: for the past 3-4 decades, basically as long as climate change has been debated publicly, US foreign policy has been dedicated to protecting oil flows.  The Tanker War of the 80s and Desert Storm in the 90s were explicitly sold to the American people as being about oil; the post-9/11 wars, by contrast, did a good job of stigmatizing any mention of their oil connections.  Say what you will about Trump, but here he isn't bothering with the facade any more, and its long past time the environmental movement articulated the ecological costs of waging permanent wars to defend  emissions.Pay Attention to the Saudi-Yemen War"
0,"This is the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme which operates in Sumatra as Yayasan Ekosistem Lestari, and which is a subsidiary of Paneco, a Swiss charity.

SOCP until recently opposed the construction of a hydropower dam in Batang Toru, the home of the newly identified Batang Toru/Tapanuli orangutan (this species is geographically separate from the Sumatran orangutan). There are around 900 Tapanuli orangutans in the wild, and none in captivity. The threat posed by the dam is assessed here. https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.33

The dam is a large project and in May the opposition of the SOCP started getting attention.

This article is in Indonesian (try Google translate or something): https://waspadaaceh.com/2019/05/06/langgar-mou-aktifitas-paneco-bisa-dibekukan-dan-staf-wna-dideportasi/

and essentially says that nationalist rhetoric was employed against the foreign staff, describing them as conducting a 'black campaign' and threatening them with deportation.

In August they went to the Dutch and British embassies in Jakarta to complain. http://inilampung.com/2019/08/tokoh-adat-tapsel-menolak-intervensi-lsm-asing (Indonesian language again)

They specifically requested that the British national who has lived in Medan, Sumatra for about 20 years as head of the SOCP, and who has an Indonesian wife &amp; children be deported. 

Very shortly after this PanEco/SOCP deleted all criticism of the dam, and said they now support it.

* https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/dam-threatens-world-s-rarest-ape-why-are-some-conservationists-suddenly-board (English)

Points to note:

* the almost entirely Indonesian-run charity, Orangutan Information Centre, attracted no such nationalistic rhetoric, despite also opposing the dam
* as mentioned above, the British manager of the SOCP, Ian Singleton, is a legal resident of Indonesia through his marriage. He would be able to nationalise as Indonesian, but may not wish to give up his British citizenship.
* the named Dutch staff member has weaker ties to Indonesia and has left the country
* Paneco/SOCP has some projects in Sumatra, namely the Ecolodge hotel in Bukit Lawang (http://ecolodges.id/en/), the Orangutan Haven zoo project (under construction - https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/our-work/creating-new-wild-populations/orangutanhaven/) as well as the Jantho orangutan release site (https://www.sumatranorangutan.org/our-work/creating-new-wild-populations/reintroduction/jantho/) among others

It shows the difficulty of foreign charities working in foreign countries and the desirability of supporting high-quality locally-managed ones.Sumatran orangutan charity comes out in support of dam they previously opposed, following threats of deportation etc. of foreign staff"

0,"My wife has been buying soap online and it has got me wondering, what is the environmental impact difference between an online purchase and one in-store. I was thinking the inputs here are in regards to how the product gets from the manufacterer to the end user. Here is what I see is the difference:

In-Store requires drive/public transit/bike/walk to the store to acquire the item.

Online purchases require a carrier to deliver the item to your door. 

However, what I don't know is the difference between the two as it relates to the rest of the supply chain. For instance, how does a bar of soap get to a store vs. how it gets to an Amazon warehouse. Are there extra steps in the supply chain in one or the other? If so, this increases the environmental impact of that single bar of soap.

Anyone with insights or resources on this?Environmental impact difference between in-store purchase and online purchase"
0,"Styrofoam is rarely recycled. Not only is it one of the most difficult substances to recycle (US code 6) , but it also often contaminated by food matter. Although I it only takes up .01 percent of municipal landfills by weight, it's a whopping 30% by volume. Yes in an ideal world it would be great if there were no Styrofoam, but let's get practical. I'm thinking you charge people who throw away more Styrofoam. If it fills up the landfill more they should pay more. Weight is an easy measurement, but if the waste is compacted volume is trickier. How do you do this when paying a human to count the Styrofoam is costs too much? How do you measure the volume/weight ratio when the ratio is distorted? Styrofoam according to the EPA has the lowest volume/weight ratio (32 lbs/1 cubic yard or 18.98 kilograms per cubic meter). Any solutions?Styrofoam - How to detect if it's in a load of garbage"

0,"Environmental movement is not just about human environment, it is also the environment of nature.  I think reducing our carbon usage and increasing clean technology is essential for the next century.   This means decreasing human population and not urbanizing rural areas.   There is a trend for environmentalism to be narrow in policy resolutions, but the need is a broad approach.  B. Owens author of half earth made a road map of how we need to reserve half of all the earth and especially key biological regions/areas as natural reserves.  Nature can not protect itself from the wants in desires of people.   Somethings I think should be obvious if this is going to be successfully implemented.  

1. Regions with low population density should not be urbanized, but protected.
2. Critical habits need to be scientifically analyzed and protected.
3. Pollution needs to be reduced.
4. Carbon usage needs to be reduced.
5. That we need to restore forests that were destroyed years ago.
6. Food production should be local and adapted to what is available of region.
7. Harvesting from nature should only be allowed after reserves are formed and a sustainable plan is developed.
8. Production needs to be local.

Looking at these issues, I have concluded some solutions may not be politically acceptable on different spectrum of ideologies.  

A. Reducing Carbon Usage is not supported by those who don't recognize our impact on Climate. 

1. Carbon reduction requires change in technology.
2. Reduction in consumption.
3. Increasing Energy Efficiency

B. Stopping Immigration to countries and regions with lower density populations.

1. Southwest United States has a severe overpopulation and water crisis.  This crisis is partly caused by immigration and migration to this region from other parts of the country.  This needs to be stopped in order to protect ecosystems and natural environment.  There are people fleeing countries because of violence.  A systemic approach of reducing poverty and crime where they currently live is a better approach then relocation.  Many species are endangered of going extinct, we need to look at protecting these species as a priority.

Reducing Foreign Trade and producing locally is not something that is generally planned for in United States.  

2. Currently the import of trade into United States is staggering, the American culture requires a definite adjustment to live a simpler for of living - using technology as a tool for our and natures environment - not a tool for over consumption.

One thing that saddens me in the current political climate is that people can not seem to talk both about the positive and negative aspects of an approach, there seems to be less flexibility in thinking and understanding.  My long range vision is having a healthy environment with half the earth dedicated to nature.  I think this only can be accomplished if people are willing to sacrifice and pay a cost in how they live - plus energetically solve problems.  Feel free to comment.  I would like for people to state 1) Long range goal for the environment, people, nature.  2). Ideas on how to get there. 3) Positives and negatives of those ideas.Environmental movement needs to be objective and scientific, less partisan and more solution oriented"

[https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang\_en/chris-d.-peyerk](https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/chris-d.-peyerk)

(This isn't the first time the Peyerk name has been in the news, his mother had to return a *Diana Award for ethics in hunting* for having lied about falsifying documents pertaining to an illegal kill in the past. I wish permits for such brutal killings as black rhinos would be revoked for people whose direct families break animal conservation laws.)

There are *multiple* reasons to be upset, but one point I want to discuss is the park's reasoning for the selection:

*""According to Namibia’s Ministry of Environment and Tourism, the 29 year old bull was deterring other younger bulls from breeding and harming population growth.""*

I don't understand why the bull couldn't have been separated instead of put up as a trophy under this permit system. I understand that any one of the rhinos would have had to be killed and there was a certain allotment of permits that allows the horrible act to be put in place in the name of 'diplomacy' or 'conservation', but it just seems like a terrible practice to kill a 29 year old bull on one of the grounds of it harming its own population growth.American Chris Peyek pays $400,000 to shoot and kill a black rhino bull in Namibia."

So a couple questions: why do you guys think environmental news is not always on the front page and talked about?

Do you ever feel there is not much that you yourself can do to make an impact on the planet? Do you think that there is not enough easily combined accessible information on small actions you can take every day to help our environment? Have you ever been inclined to donate to an environmental charity that is making an impact but you don't know if they are trustworthy or you were not sure which charity you should donate too?

Out of all the plastic waste, single use plastic bottles have wreaked a havoc on the planet. Only 20% of single use plastic bottles get recycled while the rest end up in ocean beds or landfills, where these bottles slowly degrade into microplastics. These small particles can enter the human food chain when we eat seafood or drink water contaminated with microplastics. Research is underway examining the impact of microplastics on human health.

If strict measures are not taken right now, the whole planet would be become a wasteland, and it will impact every living organism. Recycling needs to be promoted on a large scale.

• The world-wide production of plastic is currently at 35 kilograms per year per person. On average, it is increasing by 3% per year.

• Most of the plastic is used for packaging (35%), followed by the construction sector and vehicle construction.

• About 40% of the produced plastic is being disposed within 1 year (primarily packaging material).

• The average lifetime of plastic is 12 years. The main reason is the relatively long lifetime in the construction sector.

• Recycling of plastic saves on average about 2.5 kg CO2 per kg of plastic. Thus recycled plastic produces about 3.5 kg CO2 compared to 6 kg of CO2 for new plastic (production and incineration).

tonnes of plastic, a figure that is growing by 4% annually.
40% of the plastic we make is used just once. 

• By 2050, the expected production of plastic will have reached
1124 million tonnes. 8–10 million tonnes enter the oceans
annually—by 2050, the total mass of ocean plastic will
exceed that of fish. 

• In 1976, on average, each person used
2 kg of plastic annually. 

• By 2017, that figure had risen to
43 kg. 

• Every minute, human beings use 2 million plastic
bags and 1 million plastic bottles

• But of the total quantifiable marine plastic pollution, only 1% is floating on the sea surface and 5% is washed up on beaches.
The remaining 94% sits on the sea floor.

I'm curious if there are organizations out there working to help hospitals and other healthcare companies reduce this type of waste, or working to develop biodegradable alternatives to standard rubber gloves.

I live in Southwest Ohio and our summers have been about normal, hot and humid, but lately winters have seemed wetter and warmer.  The suburb I live in was built mostly between 1870-1920 and we have a lot of very large old trees, especially Poplar, Oak, Maple, Elm, and Ash.  We haven't had any particularly close infestations of Emerald Ash Borers that I know of.

But we have lost part or all of at least 6 very large mature trees in the 8 blocks around my house over the past year.  They are coming down in chunks.  A 40 foot long branch fell off of our neighbor's huge old Oak tree a few weeks ago.  It looked and still looks perfectly healthy, just with a gaping scar halfway up. A house by my kids' school had a large tree, not sure of the species, that partially fell into the power lines and the road and had to be taken down.  A 100 plus year old celebrity tree on the local golf course just completely fell apart, like it just collapsed.  Every windy storm will leave branches everywhere, some as think as my arm.  Our own front yard poplar tree had its leaves go brown and fall off mid July, but apparently this is a known issue with hot summers after wet springs.

&amp;#x200B;

How has climate change personally affected you negatively? Do you think Alex Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist for ""preaching doom and gloom?""

&amp;#x200B;

Why don't you care about other natural disasters such as solar flares? Did you know that in 2012 we missed a massive solar storm by about NINE DAYS? If that would have hit the earth we would have experienced trillions in damage and blackouts that would have lasted months or even years and tens of millions of people would have died. Why is that never mentioned by democrats that pretend to care about how the environment can negatively affect humans?

&amp;#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_storm\_of\_2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012)

\&gt;The solar storm of 2012 was an unusually large and strong coronal mass ejection (CME) event that occurred on July 23 that year. It missed the Earth with a margin of approximately nine days

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Had the CME hit the Earth, it is likely that it would have inflicted serious damage to electronic systems on a global scale.\[2\] A 2013 study estimated that the economic cost to the United States would have been between $0.6 and US$2.6 trillion.\[3\] Ying D. Liu, professor at China's State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, estimated that the recovery time from such a disaster would have been about four to ten years

&amp;#x200B;

How come liberals/socialists only propose giving government more power and making energy more expensive as a solution to these problems? Why aren't space based solutions ever proposed that could also defend us from solar storms?

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us know someone who has been a victim of the war on drugs or the war on terror (my friend had his family killed in Iraq for example) yet you claim that climate change is the thing we should be more afraid of than government authoritarian violence? You are more likely to be imprisoned for a nonviolent offense or falsely imprisoned than you are to be a victim of murder or rape (about 1 in 150 vs 1 in 300 respectively.) So it's reasonable to be more afraid of increasing government power than climate change.

&amp;#x200B;

How will increasing the price of energy negatively affect the ability of coastal residents to relocate their homes because climate is going to get warmer whether we slow down or not?Why don't liberals/socialists mention care about other natural disasters such as solar flares?

[Fly Ash](https://i.redd.it/l3ps1enb1bm31.jpg)

We all know that the fly ash is a by-product of coal combustion in electric generation power plants, which poses a wide range of environmental challenges. Since industrialization is at its pace all across the region, fly ash is becoming unavoidable. That is why it is more than important to reduce fly ash in order to minimize its impact on environment as well as human well-being. In other words, efficient and sustainable efforts are needed to reduce the overall pollution.

&amp;#x200B;

***Fact –***

***According to latest Central Electricity Authority (CEA) data available for 2016-17, almost 169 million tonnes (mt) of fly ash was generated by thermal power plants (TPPs) in India.***

&amp;#x200B;

However, one of the most interesting things is that fly ash can be used as key material in many types of cement-based products, including poured concrete, concrete block, and brick.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Types of Fly Ash -**   

&amp;#x200B;

|  **Class F fly ash**|  **Class C fly ash**|
|:-|:-|
|The burning of harder, older anthracite and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. |It is produced from the burning of younger lignite or sub-bituminous coal.|

 

So, the question is how to reduce carbon footprint and make prudent use of fly ash? The answer is proper utilization of advanced technology, government and private sector initiatives. Also there is a need of newer guidelines, marketing campaigns, workshops, awareness campaigns, conferences as well as focused initiatives. Besides that, it is also important to promote ash utilization, spread awareness and product (products produced from fly ash) promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Utilization**

According to a report, cement and brick industry can use fly ash in multiple ways to develop its products. In other words, they can use the fly ash to produce concrete slabs, bricks and poured concrete. Beyond that there are many industries that can use fly ash.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Properties of Fly ash**

Since it is tough, efficient, durable, and robust, it can also be used in road construction, structural fills, railway sleepers, and much more. In other words, it has become a reliable source for end-use industries.  

A wide range of studies and researches are also underway to discover new opportunities and avenues for the proper utilization of fly ash. In essence, it is possible to reduce carbon footprint by the systematic utilization of fly ash. All we need is to take appropriate steps to achieve our goals.Proper Utilization of Fly Ash Can Save our Environment"

It turns out that only five countries generate more than 90% of their electricity from non-fossil sources: Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and France. I thought it would be interesting to know how they do it. It turns out that all of them use significant amounts of hydropower. Three out of the five also use significant amounts of nuclear power. The exceptions are Iceland, which instead uses a lot of geothermal energy, and Norway, which relies almost completely on hydropower.

Unfortunately in the source data some countries are grouped together as a region. Crucially this is the case for ""Other South America"" which as a region generates 88% of its electricity from non-fossil sources. This region includes countries such as Paraguay which, if counted separately, would also make the top list of countries that generate more than 90% of their electricity from non-fossil fuels.

**2019** \- While this past August / September has not been like 2017 nor 2018...it has been different.

Replacing forest fire smoke was more cloudiness and rain in late June / July, and August has been different too - more early clouds - lingering the whole day in August on some days, though not as much as July. Not everyone notices - due to working indoors, not paying attention, short term memory, etc...

Mid-July news report - [https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/july-has-been-cloudier-and-rainier-than-average-but-summer-sun-is-on-the-way/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/july-has-been-cloudier-and-rainier-than-average-but-summer-sun-is-on-the-way/)

What has been different this July versus the last  5 years in July? One of the big differences is the amount cloud cover.  Here is the average sunrise to sunset cloud cover in Seattle for the  last 6 years in July.

2019 **79% - abnormal. 20% increase over 2016 high! That's huge! But not everyone notices!**   
2018 36% - ""anomaly""  
2017 36% - ""anomaly""  
2016 59% - more normal  
2015 46% - more normal  
2014 44% - more normal

Going back to earlier **2019 - January:**  

[https://mynorthwest.com/1250517/seattle-warmest-january-2019/](https://mynorthwest.com/1250517/seattle-warmest-january-2019/)

Yes, was noticeable warmer...followed by

**February 2019: snow record**

[http://www.seattleweatherblog.com/snow-stats/](http://www.seattleweatherblog.com/snow-stats/) \- can see overall trend. Note this is annualized, not by month.

Not snowy relative to Mid-West, but for Seattle it was notable.

**The future - 15 years:**

**-** Bark beetle will make major in-roads to PNW forests. The system is already becoming imbalanced...though not anywhere as bad as California.

2018 - [https://q13fox.com/2018/08/08/bark-beetles-attacking-drought-stressed-douglas-fir-trees-across-washington/](https://q13fox.com/2018/08/08/bark-beetles-attacking-drought-stressed-douglas-fir-trees-across-washington/)

Nice **Forest Service Story map** \- can see bark beetle affecting interior California heavily. There are dedicated pages for that...lots of articles / websites for dead trees in California.  Looks like Eastern Oregon and Eastern Washington (Hotter and drier) are getting affected more...but haven't found an article / video for those places - nor have I visited.

[https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE\_DOCUMENTS/fseprd573081.html](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd573081.html)

This will cause more forest fires - hence, more forest smoke in Seattle area (Western Washington)

\- **#1 issue will be food shortage.** As drought / floods / cold snaps / wild weather affects places where Seattle-area food comes from.

These charts (crudely) show how reliant US States are for imports from other states.

[http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2017/11/1/how-much-does-your-state-rely-on-other-states-for-food](http://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2017/11/1/how-much-does-your-state-rely-on-other-states-for-food)

In the grocery stores here are imported foods from other areas of the world. Rice from Thailand and California. Beef and cheese from middle America and New Zealand. Of course, vegetables from California. Just what comes off the top of my head. And since interior California will get much warmer, and with groundwater running lower.... Also, all the products made from corn (junk food / soda) - and those corn producing states are having issues. Whether it be flood / drought / cold snaps. Olive oil is imported from Spain / Italy - those folks are having problems. Seattle is a coffee capital...those areas are having issues...

Canned vegetable shortage already at Walmart / Kroger / etc... in the news. What's next?

[https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/europe/italy-extreme-weather-olive-oil-harvest-scli-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/05/europe/italy-extreme-weather-olive-oil-harvest-scli-intl/index.html)

Australia - usually a wheat exporter - is now wheat importer...last year anyway.

**#2 issue (could be #1, probably #1) will be a killer flu. Worse than Spanish Flu of 1918?  -** granted  this doesn't appear to be climate related, but it is. But that's another story I don't want to expand on at this moment. But if you pay attention to the rise of various diseases thought squashed (measles being just one), Bird Flu - which is going on big time, but just doesn't get reported well, and now Swine Fever....100 million dead pigs in China alone...that's just the official # - in 1 year - you might realize something else is going on....

[https://time.com/5610878/2018-2019-flu-season/](https://time.com/5610878/2018-2019-flu-season/) \- Longest. 2018-2019, still high year, relatively speaking, but lower than 2017-2018

[https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17910318/flu-deaths-2018-epidemic-outbreak-shot](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/27/17910318/flu-deaths-2018-epidemic-outbreak-shot) \- 80,000 dead in USA 2017-2018

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 issue - possibly water restrictions / (seasonal) water shortage.** Don't have exact figures for Seattle water supplies (Cedar / Tolt) at the moment - but I do have a link to reservoirs of a place I went camping recently...and noticed seriously low water levels. Lake Cle Elum. Less snow pack, lower water levels.

[https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hydromet/yakima/yaktea.html](https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hydromet/yakima/yaktea.html)

**#4 issue - possibly more landslides / sinkholes**

While this occurred in 2014...landslides / sinkholes are happening / opening up all over the world. (See resources link in the beginning). Whether they will start happening more in the Seattle-area...that remains to be seen. (See Earthquakes below) 

[https://www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/](https://www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/www.seattletimes.com/category/oso-landslide/)

**#5 issue - Meteor / fireballs** \- a la Chelyabinsk....shock waves causing damage. Go to American Meteor Society to learn more.

**#6 issue - Earthquakes**

You think, what does Earthquakes have to do with climate change. You might want to read a book called - WAKING THE GIANT by Bill McGuire.  Also other reasons...but I've typed enough already.

Recent off-shore Oregon quakes 6.x

**#7 - Beach closures**

Ok..I couldn't resist. Noticed more beach closures due to e.coli, algae, or what not. 

2019 - just a couple that come to mind.

**#8 - Other factors** includes economic related ones, but that is outside the scope of this analysis. But if a killer flu comes to pass for example....that would obviously affect the region.How do you think global warming / climate change / earth changes / whatever will impact YOU / your area?

0,"Did you know: \~40% of our country's energy is consumed by buildings/homes? It takes a TON of energy to heat, cool, and power the spaces we inhabit. We NEED to reduce this statistic if we are to have a sustainable future, and it must begin with a radical revamping of modern construction practices.

 Luckily, there are things we can do to reduce this statistic AND improve our quality of life--all at a competitive price.

When you decide to build, consider sustainable strategies such as Net Zero design, Passive design, The Living Building Challenge, LEED, and more. These strategies focus on increasing a building's efficiency and reducing the need for electricity. The result--less energy consumption. 

What's more, sustainable design ALWAYS promotes healthy living practices. Building occupants are forced to participate in operating the building, learning about sustainable practices that will spill over into other aspects of life. People are more likely to bike to work, take the stairs, or get outside and develop a sense of community. Simply put, building green creates the opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle.

 So let us live our best life. Let us inspire our children with the places we inhabit. Let us move toward a better future, a more sustainable future.

40% is far too high.

So firstly I need to collect plastic. I will run a collection point one hour every Monday and collect all plastic available. Then people and companies with large amounts of waste will be collected from free of charge within my local community. On Tuesday I will shred the plastic using 2 100 KG  per hour shredders. They are rated for 100 KG an hour but I am shredding plastic, not paper, so I hope to do 50 KG per hour per shredder. On Wednesday to Friday I will extruded the plastc into a long 1.75mm line. This will be wound in spools and can be put in to 3D printer. Once the 1.75mm filament is wound on to spools, they will be sold for only £3 a kilo on Saturday (to my community, no deliver available). Any leftovers will be sold online for £5 a kilo. 

So first I need to buy the equipment. I need to shredders. I can get these from screwfix for £100 each, so I will get 2 of those.

0,"I generally support environmental efforts, especially in emissions control and low/no emission energy generation. However, a a friend of mine staunchly defend veganism and mentioned that it is greener than eating red meat. Cows produce methane and CO2. To eat red meat we need to maintain a stock level and transport it to be processed and sold. Here is what I was thinking as a devils advocate supposing we did suddenly stop eating red.

If we ate just plants to meet our nutritional needs, would we like current vegans fart more?

Wouldn’t the now safe unslaughtered cows still produce the same amount of methane?

Wouldn’t the agricultural process for plants require lots of fertilizer (organic or not) which would either produce methane and CO2 as it decomposes?

And as far as everyones poo... Wouldn’t the undigested fiber of everyones high plant diet have to be pooed out, ferment in a bio reactor at a water plant only to be sent to compost and drying beds also producing green house gas?

What about the highly nitrogenous waste discharge water? Wouldn’t that find it’s way to water ways causing toxic algae blooms in an already stressed and overfished warming ocean?

Those were all my concerns. This is something that I would want to see a peer reviewed study on. The problem is I have not found any put together this way. I have found truth to all of those questions, but nothing that compares sum total emissions. This seems to be a common problem, like calculating the carbon emissions to build a nuclear powerplant, solar panel, or wind turbine. luckily these energy sources do pan out in the long run now that studies asked those questions. Eating vegan, I do it out of enjoyment from time to time (not as a full time diet), I have nothing against it, but, just some things I have not yet seen anyone ask. When I googled it I see evidence for, but have not found any considering the drawbacks.Is being began really that green?"

Today I made a very important video for me. Recently scientist have said that we have less than 12 years before the effects of global warming are no longer reversable. This means that we have to get information out on how people can help or contribute to save the planet.

I know that it can be hard to implement new things into an everyday life, that could potentially change the way you do things. For example eating less meat is very important to not lose the stability in earth's animal life. But at the same time, you eat what you are used to eating. This is why it is so hard to implement thjings like this in your everyday life.

Luckily in this video I provide you with ways you can help save the planet that don't take long time and you do help massively. This is why it is important to spread this type of information, so if 100 people do these things, the world will completely change.

I hope you now see why this is important for me. As one of the newer generations, I would like to live on a healthy and stable planet. I would rather travel 40 years to the next best planet then live in the literal hell that would be earth.

A vote for a bad candidate eats up 4 years of out 10 year deadline at best and 8 at worst. Even if that candidate does only last a term it’s likely a republican will get elected who doesn’t care about climate. That leaves us best case 2 years left and worst case -2 years left.

Vegan who lives in New England USA. I'm looking to minimize the impact of my food on the environment, i.e. looking to get food that even if not produced locally will be produced closer than alternatives. A few questions I have specifically:  
Protein:  
\- Where is seitan produced? Since it's gluten and water (to the best of my knowledge) I assume it could be made more or less anywhere in the US, but is there a place where it is typically produced?  
\- Where are beans typically grown?

\- Where is soy typically produced?

\-Because of its highly processed nature, are fake meats such as ""beyond beef"" and etc fundementally worse for the environment than the previously listed alternatives?

\-Are there other good sources of protein?

&amp;#x200B;

Carbs:

\- Where is rice typically grown?

\- Where is pasta typically produced? How much processing does the store-bought pasta go through?

&amp;#x200B;

Spices:

\- I like using spices like Paprika, Chili Powder, Cinnamon, Salt (we'll call it a spice for this thread/post/etc); are any of these spices likely to come from nearby? In general, are there any spices that would likely come from the New England area?

  
Additional Notes:  
I'm asking so I can weigh the transportation and labor costs in with any packaging as well as price just so that I can have an idea of the impact I'm having through my diet. I understand there have been similar questions in the past, I hope this is distinct enough to merit it's own thread/post/etc. Thanks.How to minimize my diets impact on the environment?"

0,"One rich American, CEO Stephen Schwarzman, is a top donor to President Trump and Mitch McConnell, and he's the CEO of Blackstone, a huge U.S. investment firm.

Blackstone have helped facilitate a boom in agribusiness in the Amazon. They’re doing this by financing a transit port and a commercial highway that runs deep into the rainforest. Those projects make it much easier and more profitable for farming and mining companies to export goods from the area. The resulting agribusiness surge is driving the destruction of the Amazon, as more rainforest is being burned to make room for growing grain or soybeans. 

The Amazon needs to be preserved in order to stave off a climate apocalypse, and developing the region with ports and highways undermines that. And it’s not even profitable in the longterm. The farms created by destroying the Amazon can only grow crops for about 10-15 years before they turn into equatorial desert, and new land needs to be cleared. But it’s all about short-term profits. Stephen Schwarzman is one of the world's richest men. In 2018, he was paid at least $568 million dollars, which was actually a drop from the $786 million he made the year before. He’s given over $10 million to Mitch McConnell’s super PAC since 2016, and he hosted a 100,000-dollar-a-plate fundraiser for Trump, who’s a close friend.

Meanwhile, his company Blackstone now has more than $500 billion in assets under management and it’s been able to grow to that size thanks to policy choices that the U.S. has made, largely with its tax code, to encourage the rapid accumulation of capital, and to privilege investment funds like Blackstone.

0,"So ever since studying hydrocarbon combustion^(1) in school, something has been gnawing at me about the right side of the equation. I finally ran the numbers this morning to determine whether or not New Water is a major contributing factor to Sea Level rise or not.

In a perfect burn, the reaction produces carbon dioxide and water. (Imperfect burns can produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas.)

To be clear, this water is effectively New Water. The hydrogen component has been locked up in a hydrocarbon chain deep under the surface of the Earth for eons. This water is produced as vapor and enters the water cycle, eventually making its way to the ocean.

So, doing a little research and a little math:

|869,000,000|Gallons of gas consumed worldwide per day^(2)|
|:-|:-|
|317,402,250,000|Gallons of gasoline consumed per year^(3)|
|1.52|Gallons of New Water produced per gallon of gas consumed^(4)|
|482,451,420,000|Gallons of New Water produced through worldwide gasoline consumption per year|

So how much could all this New Water contribute to sea level rise?

|95,797,000,000,000|Gallons of water required to raise the sea level by 1mm^(5)|
|:-|:-|
|0.005036|Potential sea level rise (in mm) contributable to New Water due to gasoline consumption annually|

&amp;#x200B;

So is the water produced from hydrocarbon consumption contributing to Sea Level Rise? Yes, but this water is a ""drop in the bucket"".

Note that these numbers focus solely on automobile gasoline, not jet fuel, butane, propane, natural gas, kerosene, etc. These are all hydrocarbons also producing New Water when burned.

Gasoline is only roughly 45% of a barrel of crude oil^(6). If someone wants to take this further to calculate all of the water produced by consuming a the rest of these petroleum products from a barrel of oil, that would be fantastic, but I don't expect much difference in the overall outcome.

When I originally began this research this morning, I wasn't expecting this outcome; the oceans are so mind-bogglingly massive it doesn't have as large of an impact as I was expecting. I hope that posting this here will help others who are asking themselves the same question.

0,"I have a slight scientific background. I am in school for engineering, I have taken low level environmental classes and I have read and watched lectures from people on the topic. Recently I have encountered some very persuasive lectures that convincingly counter the CO2 hypothesis. I am hoping someone can correct me because I do not want to be a conspiracy person or someone who has wrongly become a climate hoax believer. Here are some of the data they present that is difficult to account for. 

1) the most extensive ice core study humans have done shows that temperature rise precedes CO2 increases. 

2) if you look at temperature variation from 10k years and before that you will see fluctuations in temperature of 18 degrees F. This is FAR beyond what we are to being told is catastrophic. 

3) CO2 levels are on low side in terms of Earths history. The graphs Ive seen show that CO2 used to be closer to 1000ppm. we are currently in the 400ppm level. 

4) Solar cycles or cloud formation could completely change our hypothesis but do not have accurate models of these phenomena. 

5) we don't have anywhere near a complete understanding of climate. Climate is EXTREMELY complicated and our best nerds at MIT cant even model clouds let alone global climate changes. yet we are supposed to believe they are certain CO2 is the cause of warming 

6) the ""97% of scientist agree humans are cause global warming"" claim was done with some tricky statistics. they looked at roughly 12,000 journal article abstracts. of those abstracts  \~30% wrote about human causes of global warming. of that 30%, 97% claimed human caused global warming. that means 60% of those articles did not mention anything. its a fairly political statistic that misleads most people.(why the need to mislead?)

I genuinely hope to be set straight and I hope to god people have answers and I have been listening to quacks. I don't want to be a hoaxer. I don't want to believe I am being lied to. someone set me straight.I think human driven climate change might be a fraud. please set me straight."

He kind of makes a point here, everybody's eyes are turned to the Amazon forest burning, the reason for that is that it is the only big forest left, we should focus on the origin of the problem that is how the Amazon forest is the only big forest in our vast planet there is left ? 

If there is one thing I've learnt about architectures of software systems, it is to never rely on a one single central entity, a single point of failure that weakens the whole system. If it is brought down the whole system is brought down. Our single point of failure here is the Amazon forest.

So if you are a wealthy person, that has some land just consider planting trees, lots of them, instead of building huge houses with pools or whatever ...   the change will never come from governments, ""... we the people have the power..."" -- Charlie Chaplin.Why is it so alarming that the Amazon forest is burning ?"

And if you looked at even just this years events, it’s crazy to think we got this far without making a proper impact to benefit this earth that we’re living in. And frankly, most of us can’t bother because they think they won’t live long enough to experience these future catastrophic environmental changes, and in this situation, that’s not the case as these changes and indications of climate change are coming at us faster than we can ever cope and deal with. Out of all the things in this world right now, the most important thing we would have had to prioritize is this place, earth, our only true home. There’s no point in hoping to have a breakthrough in space exploration because if we don’t do enough to help save earth, we’ll be gone before it happens. Not enough influential people such as our leaders are even on board with any of the negative changes that is happening to our world as too many of them, including us are too fixated in economy, rivalry, and everything else apart from the sole environment we stand on. The fastest rates of environmental change recorded is in our current stage. We as a human race, the smartest living beings on earth were the only hope in restoring our home, yet we are the ones that caused the destruction of it. Because of our greed, and selfishness. Now again, I don’t think we can reverse most of what we’ve done to revive this planet, if so, it’s very slim. And if this is how we die as a society, we have to live with it.

There are a few trees, other than that about 1/2 is well kept grass, about an 1/8th is slightly swamped and the rest  is very very dense grass(as in you need a freaking tractor to cut it down). Both sides have an incline of about 5-10 degrees.

I'd like to make the forest look natural, not perfectly lined up. This will take decades, since everything seems to grow slower there. 

Does anyone have any tips about reforestation, websites that can help? I've participated in some reforestation events and they used to plant some bushes next to the actual seedling, so that the bush creates a shadow and stimulates the seedling to grow faster.

0,"Hothouse Earth + Ocean Acidification + Mass Extinction = 3 Runaway Tipping Points 

A tipping point is where a process cannot be stopped or reversed once initiated, like the the squeezing of the trigger of a gun. We face a nexus of 3 major tipping points.

1. Runaway Hothouse Earth

2. Runaway Ocean Acidification

3. Runaway Mass Extinction

Once any of these 3 tipping points are triggered, then that event becomes unstoppable and irreversible, and then proceeds to trigger the other two. We are already deep into mass extinction, and there's nothing we can do to stop it, period. The very best we can even hope to do is to slow it down.

Did you ever see a scientist go out of a limb? Of course not, if he did, there would be 3 other scientists cutting that limb to take him out.  Scientists are trained to be reticent about alarmism, and are no different than media personalities -- if they don't tow the line, their ass is grass. But being alarmist is essential now. The time for cowardice is gone.

The only thing that can destroy this planet faster than us is an asteroid about the size of Greenland, or multiple hydrogen bombs. Did you know cement use tripled in the last 20 years, and it's set to double again by 2050? Did you know 4 billion flights are had each year, and we expect 8 billion flights per year by 2050? Did you know that we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid runaway hothouse climate chaos? 

Drought, starvation, war, famine and mass poisoning are spearheading these 3 major tipping points, and each are bad enough, in of themselves. They act like the thin edge of the wedge that forms the sharp point that pricks the balloon of life on earth. The recovery of phyto- and zoo- planktons will takes several millions of years.

0,"I recently watched the following video posted by WWF and thought its important to share it with everyone.

[Our Planet: Our Business.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdWQJq2OkJs)

  Some hard-hitting facts from the video:

* Right now, we are in the midst of the Earth's sixth mass extinction. One every bit as profound and far-reaching as that which wiped out the dinosaurs.
* In the last fifty years, the number of people on Earth has more than doubled.
* Just over the past fifty years, we have embarked on an exponential rise of unsustainable exploitation of resources, unsustainable pressures on the planet, which has now reached such magnitude that science concludes that we have become our own geological epoch.
* Welcome to the Anthropocene - The Age of Humans. We are now the dominant force of change on the planet. Three quarters of the land surface and two thirds of the ocean are impacted by our activities.
* Our poles are losing their ice. In the summer, there is forty percent less Arctic sea ice cover than there was in 1980.
* Many of the world's great rivers and lakes are drying up. Lake Chad, fifty years ago, it was twenty-five thousand kilometres square of water. And now, 90% of the water has just evaporated.
* Almost half of our planet's forests have been felled for their timber, and to make space for ourselves and our livestock. About 60% of global deforestation of the tropical forests of the planet is to produce beef. About 30% is to produce crops.
* Mangroves, full of colour and life, are being cleared to make way for shrimp farms and beach resorts.
* At sea, our extensive over-fishing is leading to the collapse of key fish stocks. We have already lost ninety percent of large oceanic predators, like tuna, sharks and swordfish.
* We have replaced the wild with the domestic. We and the animals we raise to eat make up ninety-six percent of the weight of mammals on Earth. Just four percent is made up of wildlife.
* Half of the fertile land on the planet is now farm land.
* Our takeover of the natural world has been so successful, that in the last fifty years, populations of wild animals have declined on average by sixty percent.
* As the planet warms, weather systems are becoming less predictable. Deadly storms, fires and floods are all becoming more frequent and more severe.
* Over ninety percent of people on the planet breathe dangerously polluted air.
* The services that biodiversity provides for us are estimated to be worth twice as much as the entire globe's GDP. The destruction of our natural world is already costing us trillions of dollars every year. Suddenly, the costs of the Age of Humans are outweighing the benefits.
* We are at risk of entering a danger zone where we could trigger irreversible and self-amplifying change which could push the whole planet ultimately away from the desired equilibrium.
* If we continue with Business As Usual, scientists predict that a baby born today could barely be in her twenties by the time the soils of the frozen north thaw, releasing their locked methane, and any chance of controlling the climate is lost. She could be in her thirties when the last of the coral reefs collapse as a result of ocean acidification and warming. By the time she is sixty, overuse of fertilisers and pesticides could have killed off soil microorganisms and pollinating insects. There would be no more fertile soil. The weather becomes increasingly unpredictable, leading to a global food crisis. Supply chains in multiple sectors may have broken down. As she reaches her eighties, our planet could be four degrees warmer. She may have lived through the extinction of countless species. Large parts of the Earth may be uninhabitable. And global peace, an impossibility. The cost of dealing with this future, if even possible, is estimated to be over five hundred and fifty trillion dollars. Almost double the entire wealth in the world today.
* The Anthropocene has both a negative and a positive side. Thanks to the fact that we are now so clever and so dominant, we can use our own intelligence and our technologies to become positive Anthropocene engineers, Anthropocene stewards. So it's up to us.

Old, but still very relevant. In 2015 the International Monetary Fund published a report on subsidies too fossil fuels. They estimated that fossil fuels receive 5.3 trillion dollars in subsidies, or 6.5 % of world GDP.  

How is this even possible? “Only” 490 billion dollars are direct subsidies, the rest are so called externalities. For those unfamiliar with externalities, here is an example:

You can’t have a music festival in your backyard. Even if you, the musicians and the attendees agree on a price. Why? Because your neighbours are not getting compensated or even agree to the noise and other damages.  
 The same applies to fossil fuels. When you burn coal (or natural gas, petroleum etc.) there are a lot of pollutants that have a wide number of effects, for example health damages and damages due to global warming.  IMF tried to estimate the price of these effects, but be aware, these numbers are uncertain. 

So, what are these externalities

*  Global warming - 1,268 Bn
* Local pollution – 2,734 Bn
* Congestion – 359 Bn 
* Accidents – 271 Bn
* Road damage – 24 Bn

Coal is the king here, receiving 3.14 Trillion of the 5.30 trillion dollars. This is mostly because it is extremely damaging to local air quality, causing diseases and early death.

Sure, some of these externalities seam a bit strange like congestion, because this would happen with electric cars to. 

So, we have an economic system where you don’t have to pay for the damages of fossil fuels. We have made coal, petroleum and gas artificially cheap. The least we can expect is that we must pay the REAL price for the energy we use. 

If someone tries to say that renewable energies only work when subsidized, well this is true for fossil to. Especially some of the more extreme forms like tar sand.  

A 2010 study by Global Subsidies Initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources. Results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 US cents per kWh of energy they produce (the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-OECD countries), nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents / kWh, renewable energy (excluding hydroelectricity) receives 5.0 cents / kWh and bio-fuels receive 5.1 cents / kWh in subsidies. But 0.8 US cents are only a tiny part of the real subsides. If we assume that this is only 10 % of the real subsidies then fossil fuels are up to 8.0 US cents per kWh, which is more than renewable! Take this conclusion with a bucket of salt, I have not found any similar studies for externalities for renewable. But these forms of energy pollute much less, so one would assume that the externalities are way less than fossil. These two studies are also 5 years apart, and thigs can change a lot.

TL;dr fossil fuels are heavy subsidies because they do not pay for the negative effects on local and global environment. We should have a broader understanding of what subsidies are to encompasse damages to health and the enviromente.IMF estimated in 2015 that Fossil Fuel Energy is subsidized with 5.3 trillion USD"

The best thing is (by going vegan) by doing so you are saving 20 pounds of CO2, 1,100 gal of water, 45 pounds of grain per day. With of course the added benefits of saving indigenous land, endangered species, and 1 animal a day from the slaughterhouse.

0,"Dear Everyone Who Wants to Save the World;

We all want to save the planet, but our methods are tired and never worked in the first place. Lets stop with the symbolic protests and fix the problems directly, effectively, and immediately. Our leaders are inadequate to the task, but we can solve things directly, without them.   

I believe the answer is to pursue solutions, not to stand around with signs demanding other people solve our problems. Here is how we can save the  world for nearly no money, using existing tech and proven methods. Anyone with a few tens of millions of dollars could pursue one or more of these solutions, and become a multi-billionaire in the process.  

**The lowest hanging fruit** in the present day is cleaning/fertilizing the oceans in order to restore them to the state they existed in prior to industrialization. This can be accomplished by way of filtering the garbage patches, and adding rice hulls soaked in wood paste and iron oxide. These rice hulls serve as time-release, fully biodegradable fertilizer, supplying iron and silica to the de-nutriated deep oceans. The second part of this will be immensely profitable and save commerical fishing, by reversing 400 years of taking more from the seas than we give back.  

Obvious partners: Florida bauxite mines have the iron oxide, wood pulp mills have the wood paste, rice farmers have the hulls. All are currently waste products, and can be acquired cheaply ($150/ton, will fall with economy of scale.)  Commercial fishing companies are going under worldwide, and the larger players would likely partner with us to save their livelihoods.  

Obstacles:  UN law of the sea prohibits deliberate dumping of fertilizer in international waters. For this we need fishing companies as partners. The profit motive will serve us to get fertilization going, and cleanup can be tied into the granting of fertilization/fishing rights.  

Estimated costs: a few tens of millions of dollars annually would cover the costs of fertilizing the oceans, and this would be recuperated annually in  the form of greatly increased fish haul. Unknown lobbying fees to pass laws allowing UN (or someone) to grant fishing exclusivity in exchange for fertilization and cleaning responsibilities.  

Likely outcome: immediate(under 180 day)  40-50% reduction in oceanic albedo in treated areas, rising as the plankton community grows around the time-release fertilizing rice hulls. Estimated carbon offset, after fertilizing all nutrient-depleted oceanic waters, and both polar oceans, of 50-75% annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Massive production of oceanic plankton, shrimp, fish, at observed rates of upwards of 10+ tonnes CO2 sequestered for every 1 tonne of fertilizer added.  

Additional beneficial effect of plankton exhaling DMS (dimethyl sulfate), a cooling chemical which promotes marine cloud formation, leading to additional localized cooling and further reducing albedo. Difficult to  calculate, the increase in cloud production is a common feature of all  algal blooms worldwide.  

*By my (admittedly incomplete) calculations, this is the cheapest, fastest, most easily deployed method of climate healing available to us today.*  

**Second  Solution:** Widespread microbial treatment of oceans, river outlets, to treat nitrogen and phosphate overload from agricultural runoff.  

You can't add nutrients to most of the shallow ocean, and especially not around river outlets, because the issue there is over-nutriation, and oxygen is the limiting factor.

So, in a two part solution, we need to add microbes that metabolize  phosphates and nitrogen, and we need more biologically available oxygen. The microbes are easy, they can be grown in agar and applied via a  spray system (boat, buoy, barge, or terrestrial) to river outflows as they meet the sea. The harder part is increasing the biologically available oxygen.  

For this we can use tethered aerators on buoys, which can convert wave action into finely dissolved oceanic oxygen by way of a simple one-way valve which allows oxygen into the top of the buoy, and then forces it out of the bottom of the buoy through a fine sieve as the buoys descend from each wave crest. By letting the waves do the work, we cut costs precipitously, and the machinery becomes much lower maintenance/cost.  

Combined, the microbes and increased oxygen break down the abundant phosphates and nitrogen into biologically available nutrients, which other species can utilize. Because the buoys keep the water from going hypoxic, life flocks to the now-available nutrients. By balancing the available nutrients with sufficient oxygen and innoculating the river outflows with species which can process agricultural runoff, we keep our shallow oceans alive, and prevent the massive die-off of coastal waters. We additionally sequester substantial (though yet unknown) carbon into the bodies of living creatures.  

Stabilizing the oceanic life web is of utmost importance. The seas are most of the surface of our planet, and without them functioning as they have been for millions of years, we will soon perish. They produce most of our oxygen, and sequester most of our greenhouse emissions. We must rebalance the seas, and part of that is management of our wastes.  

I don't know enough about this particular solution to estimate costs, but objections will be from anyone who has to foot the bill, especially agriculture. Coastal environmental group opposition is guaranteed.  

Desired results: remediation and elimination of river outlet dead zones, closing the cycle on human waste of fertility causing oceanic hypoxia. Revitalization of coastal oceanic waters, massive carbon sequestration.  Because I haven't worked on precisely this sort of project in the past, I will need to do more research into the numbers before I am comfortable providing specific estimates of the carbon sequestration and overall effects on the seas. The result will be a massive reduction in worldwide oceanic dead zones, and a concurrent bloom of all living things, each sequestering carbon in the process of living.

**Third solution:** reversal of oceanic acidification through usage of Olivine mineral degradation through tidal action.  

I love the simplicity of this one. We need to make the oceans more alkaline, quickly and cheaply, before the changing pH kills all the corals and the rest of us  too. The best solution available right now is to take an abundant mining waste product, the mineral Olivine, crush it up, and distribute it in into the tide zones of the ocean. By putting crushed Olivine on the beaches, we allow the natural wave action to slowly degrade this alkaline mineral into the coastal waters. This will return  the oceans to their pre-industrial pH balance, and save us all from the nasty fate of being suffocated by the seas belching out methane and carbon.  

Possible allies: mining companies would love to sell Olivine, and this is a good way to bring them into the climate fight on the side of life. Anyone interested in saving the oceans. Coastal fishing companies, also anyone who wishes to save the corals. This is a good candidate for carbon offset programs as well.  

Objections: it's geoengineering, so environmentalists  and beach protection groups, first and foremost. There are no international legal problems with a nation doing this inside of its own economic exclusion zone, but in the USA, state, federal, and local environmental regulations will have to be modified.  

Estimated costs: I don't have current numbers, but Olivine is sitting in massive heaps worldwide. The costs of transport, crushing, dispersal will all measure in tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, spread across a decade or more. Re-application may be necessary with time, depending on other climate actions taken/the rate of drawdown of GHG emissions.  

*The biggest obstacle* is that this is not monetarily profitable, and will have to be paid by  governments/society. Economic benefits are hard to define due to the nature of measuring the effect of pH on ocean life. Ultimately, this is cost that must be paid to save the seas, not a business, and thus unlikely to be implemented before more profitable solutions.  

Desired results: a decadal reversal of ocean if acidification benefits all oceanic life aside jellyfish and acidophilic species. All fish, whales, plankton, corals, kelp, sea grasses, most oceanic life benefits. Humans benefit immensely, when we don't die with the seas belching greenhouse gasses into the air. Saving the seas from going acidic is among the most crucial projects of the near term future. We save it and live, or else fail to do so and die suffocating in our own wastes.  

**Fourth solution:** widespread terrestrial revitalization through balancing of the soil biome. We can correct the imbalanced soil microbiome, revitalize exhausted land, reverse desertification and remove nearly any soil pollution simply by adding microorganisms which consume the waste products, and which excrete biologically available nutrients.  

This is not new tech, but an acceleration of existing natural cycles. Members of my family, myself among them, have worked in this industry since the early 1990s, and we have been successfully cleaning up sludge ponds, wastewater treatment plants, mining and agricultural runoff, and fuel oil spills for nearly 30 years, for pennies on the dollar as compared to other methods.  

Microbes  breed so quickly that (if properly motivated) they can remove decades of damage in a matter of months. Once you have inundated the soil, you simply must keep them wet for 90-180 days, and they will balance the soil for you, before dying out and becoming food for the next generation of soil microbes.  

In but one example, we have quietly restored several hundred square miles of desert to grasslands in the southwestern USA, and as long as the soil stays wet, the grassland keeps expanding. The total cost was $850 before water and labor. Anyone can do what we do. It's bone simple and the only reason it isn't done everywhere is there's no profit in fixing people's problems virtually for free, or in giving them the means to do it themselves. As such, you've likely never heard of it, and these methods are rarely emphasized in microbiology, remediation, or environmental science. Nonetheless, they exist and work better, cheaper, faster, than any other method we've discovered.

Obstacles:  Halliburton, Monsanto, Denali, large fertilizer and chemical companies.  We put them out of business by doing their job better, cheaper, and faster. Environmental regulations and pressure groups. Sadly, environmentalists are one of the biggest obstacles to widespread  microbial soil remediation.  

Costs: next to nothing for the microbes, but lots of water is necessary to keep them alive and happy. Because untreated/minimally treated groundwater or wastewater can be used, water costs can be minimized and human drinking water preserved to the greatest possible extent. Most projects will see results within weeks, and be fully completed within 6 months. For perhaps 100 million dollars across ten years, we could turn every desert and all the marginal land on Earth (roughly 11% of Earth's surface) into vibrant, growing grasslands, rich with life and sequestering carbon more efficiently than any other landscape.  

Desired results: by revitalizing the land, we would sequester more CO2,  methane, and GHGs than any other method except for solution 1, which is  to do the same thing to the seas. Estimated offset of performing this more than 50% of annual anthropogenic emissions, as an annual offset. Additionally, the creation of multiple inches of topsoil annually multiplies the carbon sequestration of this method, but in order to improve our measuring techniques, we will likely have to implement this method and perform careful field observations.

**In conclusion**, these solutions, totalling well less than a billion dollars over a decade, would have the result of sequestering more carbon than we emit as a species. They will give us the time to implement new forms of power generation,  transportation, and infrastructure, and save us from climate apocalypse.  

*If  we could find the funds, I have the contacts for everyone we would need  to make these projects happen, and further, have access to all of the  relevant tech. We could start this immediately.*  My entire career, and my father's career, and our entire company's history has been an effort to discover the means of arresting anthropogenic global warming, and to that end, we now have the methods by which we can save the world.

We lack the financial means, and political connections, to make more than a tiny dent in the problems faced by mankind. But by sharing the knowledge we have gathered with the millions of willing and able people who wish to save our Earth, I know that we can solve this problem. Not mitigate it. Solve it dead, and live the rest of our lives on a living world. It's worth untold billions of lives. Surely, it is worth trying, is it not?  

I've  been bashing my head against the wall for years trying to catch the ear of someone with money or power, and meanwhile making a tidy living doing at small scale what I'm suggesting we do globally. But I cannot stand by any longer, watching mankind commit suicide when the means to save ourselves are within our grasp.  

It  will work. It will cost shockingly little. We will save the world in a decade, and most of what I'm proposing is profitable. We just need to get this message to the right people. So, who knows some billionaires/millionaires/enough concerned citizens to fund this? We  have the solutions. Let's make the conversation one of implementing  proven solutions, not one of demanding action from corrupt elites.

We can fix this. So let's do it, instead of begging others to!

Until our dining service has enough staff, they will continue to use plastic (which is understandable and we are trying to encourage people to work at the dining halls).

0,"It's typical to hear about the seriousness of environmental problems. Disturbing statistics about everything form the destruction of the Amazon to climate change to the mass slaughter of sharks have existed for decades. And existed. And existed. And that's that. 

Is there any good news? Any reason to have hope? Any positive change happening? You never really hear stats about things getting better in the environmental movement. It feels like it's spreading awareness and encouraging lifestyle changes (which IMO just slow the sinking of the ship) and activism and so on and nothing actually changes or gets better. 

We have projections about what we will lose or are losing, but nothing about what we won't. Easiest example; What amount of rainforest, if any, do we know is protected? Has that increased at all? Is there anything we've actually insured is safe? 

It's like no matter what happens, everything you hear about the environment remains the same, or gets worse. 

I'd say other than climate change, loss of the rainforest, sharks and coral reefs bother me most. I could say species extinction, but most of that is happening in the Amazon. On this metaphorical sinking ship, it seems like very little has been pulled out of the water and put in a lifeboat.In the last 20 years, is anything as good as saved? What's the most substantive good news we have?"

It’s incredibly inexpensive and easy to grow with minimal sunlight and water and it grows super fast. Instead of using plastics forks, knives, straws, cups we use bamboo versions. Or alternatively just use chop sticks. At first it would probably cost more but as it becomes more standardized it would become cheaper and cheaper. No only that bamboo that’s thrown out can just be turned into mulch. On top of that it would be more satisfying to eat off of smooth wood than fake plastic. Let me know what you think.Suitable replacement for single use plastics. Perhaps bamboo?"

Now that's a wonderful opportunity for everyone even the bank-less people in less fortunate countries.
Instead of writing a white paper and go fundraising or do an ICO they decided to build the app and reward the community for their contribution to network growth and security. So not investors, banks or other wealthy parties have a voice in the direction to go but the whole community has.
On march 14 this year the beta version of the app went live for iOS and Android and over 250.000 active users from over 175 countries have joined so far.
There is a multilingual chat in the app where people from all over the world are discussing the project and bring up ideas for future improvements. Developers also answer many questions there.
Somewhere near the end of the year the peer-to-peer marketplace will open it's doors on testnet and people are able to use their collected Pi for the first time. Very exciting to be part of this from such an early stage.
If you're also interested you can read more on www minepi com

Also considering some of their other plastic filled packaging (e.g. fish sticks individually wrapped in plastic, white fish fillets individually packaged in the freezer) is probably much worse for the environment, are they just doing this to draw attention away from those products?

0,"first of all let me be pblunt and short.

1)climate change isnt going to stop suddenly.

2) why not target air pollution, water pollution etc this sounds much better and everyone can agree on it.

3)people fear that in order to save climate we have to pay additional taxes hence the consipracies. which is plausible considering western countries wont be affected much.

4)why no activism in eastern countries which are going to affected the most. 

5)if people are blaming outsourcing for poor country pollution. what would happen if it is reversed. isnt india already polluting environment without being much of western countries 'slave worker'?

6) how does raising taxes help the environment? also i read many reports and in books that co2 isnt contributor to  global warming other toxic gases are so whats the big problem with it if everything is getting efficienter.

7)if raising living standard increases carbon footprint then china and india are going to severly mess up the environment.

Imo climate activism is overblown and highly exaggerated atleast in western countries because tgings run efficiently there. If climate change has to be prevente please consider activism in china and other countries for norms and regulations.

i live in india. here heavy vehicles are old there is too much pollution, life standad is increasing so everyone is buying new vehicles,there is increase in water consumption, increase in factory production, increase in chemical release in water. there is no official guideline to check and prevent even if there are people are easily bribed. there are no of  regions   causing cancer to people. 
western style of living has made mass consumers which in turn has ill effects both on society and environment.  i am not saying its bad but there are no strict rules and even if there were most people here are uneducated and to whatever they want. 

peaceif climate change is such a big deal why dont activists target 'x pollution'?"
0,"This may fall on deaf ears but I feel as though I need to say this. At the end of the day we are, and always have been, creatures of habit. When something comes down the pipeline we love we see it and have to take part in it because it releases chemicals in the brain we enjoy. Many of you have fixed lifestyles where you live balanced lives, and you think, well why not them? Why don't they eat vegan, or drive eco friendly cars, or go without plastics? What assholes!

Here in lies the problem with our thinking in how it stops at this point. 

Have any of you every had the displeasure of dealing with a drug addict as a friend or even in your family? Addicts are predictable once they fall deep into the world. They care about little more then the next high. That's what endless materialism does to people in this society. It teaches them to marginalize themselves and spend endless ours pursuing a fleeting feeling even at the cost of the world. And I don't expect them to overcome it, just like we don't just expect addicts will as well -- We take them to rehab.

See, the problem isn't these people you can't empathize with and want to hold accountable for the destruction of so much. But we all seem to forget that the dealers pulled them in and kept them coming for more. The dealers do much out of the call to more materialism, and their own addictions, but at a more conscious effort and greater lengths. When the Brazilian government burns down the forest for farm land much of you said, ""We need to stop buying meats!"" That's how we stop this market. But why shouldn't we just stop the people burning down the forest? These people go to every length to design something you get hooked on, and make you think it is morally justifiable, and when we find out they make minor adjustments and wait for the next thing to suck dry so they can get a little more materialism. And they'll keep doing it regardless of how woke and level headed you are. And they will continue to not need to even slither for people who are even less in tune with the world.

The  responsibility needs to be at the source. These people need to be fought. If they aren't they get power. And at the end of the day the only thing that can stop a horrendous philanthropist is people demanding they won't choke in factories, and that the system and that people who take advantage are outed. 

We need to build something they can't take advantage of and retain a fair amount of our freedom. That is is the only way forward. But it's not getting mad at simple people who fell victim to something they had no control over and that was DESIGNED to ensure they can't stop it from influencing them.To all of you mad at people hurting the environment by purchase -- I implore you to rethink your mindset."

I am fairly frugal. I try to take public transport and ride my bike. I live with my mother to reduce the construction of new property. I don't travel much. I will never have children.

As such, I save quite a bit and invest it in just about everything eg stocks, property, gold, bonds, and crypto. Mostly now I simply invest in ethical ETFs.

Something I do like though are the finer and more elegant things, eg nice clothes, a nice bike, nice food, and it is not just the functional aspects I like eg the aerodynamics of a bike or how healthy or organic food is, but also the aesthetics. I like to buy nice, expensive clothes with organic vegan fibres. In every purchasing decision, there are aesthetic, functional, and social and environmental considerations considerations.

However, whenever I indulge in these aesthetics or luxury, I feel cautious because I understand consumerism drives environmental degradation. 

My question is is such a lifestyle hyoocritical? Furthermore, if there is an environmentally friendly luxurious lifestyle, what does it look like? I imagine I'd rent in the city in a high-density apartment where I can walk everywhere and have a bike to get me places further away if they are on or near bike trails. Maybe I'll have a Tesla Model S somewhere in case I need to get somewhere inaccessible by bike or public transport, although there is always Uber.

0,"This graph from EMBRAPA (""EMpresa BRAsileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria"" or Brazilian Agricultural Research Agency) shows in this video (which I suggest you to set english tranlation) that along time the amount of cattle increased from 150 million to 190 million heads (red), while pastures fell from 215 to 167 million hectares (blue). 

That means in 1990 every cow consumed 1,43 hectares, while in 2018 every cow consumed 0,87 hectares, or 60% less pasture per capita, thanks to technology.

video also shows that 50% Brazilian territory is protected by regulatory laws in such a way rain-forest is untouchable for any purposes, being it agricultural, mineral extraction, roads, railroads or whatever things, and that Brazil uses only 7% of territory to agricultural production, compared to more than 10% in most of industrial countries. 

These protections are because national parks, indigenous lands and many other reasons detailed by EMBRAPA, and so protected land is bigger than entire Europe (Ukraine included). That is, an entire Europe of untouchable forests.

0,"# Sustainability labelling for food packaging

The food we eat not only has an impact on our health, but also the health of our planet. Climate change, water shortages and plastic pollution are just some of the global problems food production contributes to. But when we buy our food, we aren’t given any information about whether a product is bad for the environment or not. [Food packaging in the UK has nutritional information](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-read-food-labels/) printed on it to help consumers make healthier choices. Why not also have sustainability information, so it’s easier to make eco-friendly choices too?

There are many factors that affect how sustainable a food product is, meaning there are a variety of ways you could present this information to consumers. From only focusing on one element; such as a product’s carbon footprint, to a detailed breakdown of every way the environment is affected during a product’s life cycle. To give an idea of how food sustainability labelling might work, here are 3 different designs that could be implemented.

**Please note, the statistics and figures displayed in each design have not been rigorously researched, so should not be considered accurate. They are purely for illustrative purposes.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Product's carbon footprint label

Here are 3 variations of the carbon footprint label and an explanation of the information they contain:

[Product's carbon footprint label variations](https://i.redd.it/2j36tppjwyi31.jpg)

This design would only provide information about a product’s carbon footprint. As climate change is the most pressing concern we collectively face, increasing awareness of how much carbon dioxide emissions are caused by different food products is paramount and should be our main priority when considering sustainability labelling.

**Carbon footprint:** The CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of the product.

**Colour:** A traffic light system is used so consumers can quickly identify if a product’s carbon footprint is low (green), medium (amber), or high (red).

**CO² in kilos:** The total carbon emissions caused by the product are displayed in kilogrammes. This would include emissions created during the farming, processing and shipping of a food product.

**Percentage of daily emissions limit:** Each person should have a daily carbon footprint target, or allowance. Much like the daily reference intakes displayed on food nutrition labelling in the UK, making it easier to work out if your diet has an acceptable carbon footprint or not. The target would be calculated based on a level of CO² emissions deemed acceptable for each person.

&amp;#x200B;

# Product's overall sustainability label

Here are 3 variations of the overall sustainability label and an explanation of the information they contain:

[Product's overall sustainability label variations](https://i.redd.it/7zsbqdccxyi31.jpg)

This design would combine a variety of different food sustainability factors and condense them into a very simple explanation of whether a product is sustainable or not. Helping consumers make a more informed purchase, without bombarding them with lots of information. This could include elements such as:

* CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of a product
* Land required to produce a product
* Water required to produce a product
* Single use/non recyclable packaging used for a product
* Chemical waste created during the production of a product

**Categorisation:** An obvious classification of whether a product is sustainable or not.

**Colour:** A traffic light system is used so consumers can quickly identify if a product is sustainable (green), unsustainable (amber) or extremely unsustainable (red).

**Explanation:** A simple explanation of how much the food product impacts the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

# Product's sustainability breakdown label

Here is an example of the product's sustainability breakdown label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label](https://i.redd.it/cdotgrssxyi31.jpg)

This design would identify all of the major elements of a food product’s life cycle and their individual impact on the environment. It would also provide an overall indication of whether the product is sustainable or not. It closely mimics [the standardised nutrition labelling format already used in the UK](https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/fop-guidance_0.pdf), making it easier for people to adapt to this labelling system. While it is a lot of information for consumers to digest, it would allow consumers to make well informed choices about what food they eat.

**Sustainable daily consumption quota:** this is a guideline limit to how much one person can sustainably consume on a daily basis. Each resource shown (carbon footprint, water usage, etc) would have an independent percentage, relative to what our planet can sustain. 

**Resources:** 5 different aspects of food production would be scrutinised:

* **Carbon footprint:** the CO² emitted during farming, processing and transportation of a product
* **Water usage:** the total amount of water required to produce a product
* **Land usage:** the total amount of land required to produce a product
* **Single use packaging:** the amount of non-recyclable packaging used for a product
* **Chemical waste:** the amount of chemical waste created during the production of a product

 **Carbon footprint**

Here are 3 variations of the carbon footprint portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: carbon footprint variations](https://i.redd.it/ovouqxx9zyi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if a product’s carbon footprint is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **CO² in kilos:** The total carbon emissions, displayed in kilogrammes, created during the farming, processing and shipping of a food product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily CO² emissions limit is used by the product.

**Water usage**

Here are 3 variations of the water usage portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: water usage variations](https://i.redd.it/3nvl92bvzyi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of water required to produce a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Water in litres:** The total amount of water required to produce a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily water consumption limit is used by the product.

**Land usage**

Here are 3 variations of the land usage portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: land usage variations](https://i.redd.it/lmb6p1530zi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of land required to produce a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Land in metre squared:** The total amount of land required to produce a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily land consumption limit is used by the product.

**Single use packaging**

Here are 3 variations of the single use packaging portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

&amp;#x200B;

[Product's sustainability breakdown label: single use packaging variations](https://i.redd.it/8l5tstag0zi31.jpg)

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of non-recyclable packaging used for a product is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Percentage of single use packaging:** The total amount of single use packaging used by a product.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily single use packaging limit is used by the product.

**Chemical waste**

Here are 3 variations of the chemical waste portion of the label and an explanation of the information it contains:

https://i.redd.it/s7fo90yr0zi31.jpg

* **Colour:** consumers can quickly identify if the amount of chemical waste generated by a product’s production is low (green), medium (amber) or high (red).
* **Chemical waste in grammes:** The total amount of chemical waste generated by a product’s production.
* **Percentage of quota:** How much of 1 person’s daily chemical waste limit is used by the product.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

It is clear that implementing any kind of sustainability labelling system would be a complex endeavour. Not only would the life cycle of a product need to be rigorously researched, but the proven sustainability of a product would have to be heavily policed. An independent body would be required to refine and govern such a scheme, as it is unlikely that food manufacturers could be trusted to do it themselves. 

Some may say that sustainability labelling is too complex and laborious to introduce. But the fact is, [there are numerous independent studies](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987.full) that detail how sustainable different types of food are. The information is available, which means that sustainability labelling is possible. If consumers are being expected to make more environmentally conscious food choices, it is only fair that we are given clear information on food packaging that helps us do this.

Without government oversight and participation, sustainability labelling is unlikely to be implemented, so pressure from voters is needed to get governments to act. If you agree that the introduction of a sustainability labelling system would be a benefit to consumers, show your support by signing one of the petitions I have created. There is a UK petition and an EU petition. If neither is applicable to your country of residence, create your own petition to your government!Sustainability labelling for food packaging"

**Why renewables can’t save the planet** | Michael Shellenberger | TEDxDanubia 17 min Jan 2019

- This video is surprisingly good. If Germany had spent all the money they spent on renewables on nuclear instead, they would already be a zero emissions. I never understood why they would use solar panels to build diesel cars anyhow.

We have to reduce emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid runaway hothouse climate chaos.

We also have to set aside 50% of the whole planet to avoid runaway mass extinction. (See today's other post)

Runaway Mass Extinction = Inevitable + Inexorable
---
According to the University of Michigan, the U.S. cut 90% of its forests since 1600. See link:

http://resilience.earth.lsa.umich.edu/units/deforestation/image006.jpg

The U.S. wiped out anywhere from 50-100 million buffalo in a matter of decades in the 1800s.

There used to be so many passenger pigeons in the US, that their annual migration would block out the noon day sun, turning daylight into dark.

There used to be so many cod off Cape Cod that early explorers were afraid they would lift the ship up out of the water and capsize them, and the noise of their bodies scraping against the outside of the hull terrified the sailors.

There used to be so many sea turtles in the Caribbean that the weight of all their bodies totalled more than the weight of all the buffaloes that once roamed the great plains.

There used to be so many insects, people had to wash them off their vehicles every few hundred miles during road trips.

Nowadays, humans and livestock consume 40% of the green stuff that grows on all earth's land each year.

Humans and livestock are 97% of the weight of all the land vertebrates on earth.

Our crops are so poisonous that nothing else can grow or live for miles around. Even the germs in our soil can't stand it. The fish, frogs, birds, insects and mammals can't survive anywhere near our croplands. Our farms are lifeless green deserts. The only thing that can withstand all this poison are modified crops.

Neonic seeds are so poisonous you have to wear gloves to handle them, pets are warned away from them, and just 3 neonic seeds will kill a bird.

Our oceans are set to wipe out most all the plankton on earth, as ocean acidification primes itself to go supernova. While explosive ocean acidification die off events have happened before, they have **never** happened at today's breakneck speed. Even the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs didn't have so explosive and complete effect on the oceans as we are having now.

We are fundamentally unable to grasp how hopeless things have become. We keep thinking we can prevent this. We keep thinking we can ""do"" something about it. 

The upcoming mass extinction is inexorable and inevitable. It cannot be stopped or reversed. This guarantee is 100X stronger than any guarantee Elon Musk and Bernie Sanders promise you.

This Wednesday I plan to talk about reducing or eliminating our beef intake and why it’s beneficial for both the environment and our health. 

The catch? Many of my followers are from agricultural areas and are extremely skeptical of any information that goes against their lifestyle (which is understandable).  Thankfully, I have a reputation of being very well researched and I keep notes with resources to share with people who question the information I share. 

Which is why I’m here today! I’m a dietitian with a passion for the environment, but not the educational background.

As far as i can, i often try to raise awareness about the problem, donate money to no-profit associations, do separate collection, move by bicycle, recycle/reuse things (e.g. electronics) and so on... but.. is this actually enough?

I'm a computer science graduate (MD) and i wish i could do something for the cause using my skills and my knowledge, but i can't find any practical application in the environmental/ecology domain that can actually be considered effective for the purpose. I can leave my job tomorrow if needed.

0,I'm just here to vent on how we as a society are done for.  I do think that the only reason the environment has ended up like this is because we as humans are selfish. We could have stopped this damage to our environment but we are so selfish that we can't even bother and now some people further down the line will never fully be able to enjoy thier life. We are suppose to be the intelligent life form on this planet but goddamn we decided to live our lives out like a bunch of morons. Now it's too late to fully fix what we have done and we'll have to live our lives knowing that no matter what we do we  on a scale unknown are fully fucked.We're already dead
0,"A century ago, economies debated the benefits and disadvantages of  Capitalism versus Socialism. Their conclusion was, Capitalism acted as a motivator to progress with the promised monetary reward and Socialism inhibited the human need to produce since he was cushioned and guarenteed basic services. So, a Monkey does tricks, it will get a banana versus it does or does not, a box of bananas will always be there.

Though we are not monkeys, and people do evolve even if we still have primal genetics. The world today, sure made its remarkable advances but at what cost? 

The blindly persue of capital is destroying our humanity and our only home. Wars, disease, pollution, dictators, ignorant politicians. All in the persuit of the same thing. Money. 

Without that monetary gain, we will lose access to health, education, shelter, clean food and water, clothing, etc.. In this time of ours, the fight to guarentee these essentials is becoming more competitive and aggressive. We humans are compromised of many characters, one of which is greed. But to each character, exists a balance. Too much of anything is an imbalance and results in a specific pathology. Greed has become a wide spread cancer, pushing people to do what it takes to guarentee any of those basic essentials.

The fires of the Amazon; The waste in our water; the chemicals in our food; All have a route cause. The fight to gain capital to buy essentials of survival and also pleasure.

I would like to believe that we are evolving to take pride in our work and our advancement. But let us think for a minute, how can we abolish the monetary system or what would it take to control our pathology that is massacering our humanity and our only home. What would it take for us to create a world similar to the federation of Star Trek. 

Elimination of poverty; Essentials are guarenteed; The recouperation of our environment; Our pride and reward results from our advancement and progress of our specialized work or studies; Elimination of wars; A new system of governance based on all of the above.

How can we drastically alter the current inadequate global system ?Treating the root cause, not the symptom."

&amp;#x200B;

* be an organizer, organize locally, even a small occupation of an airport for only a little while sends a big message.
* Airports, shipyards, highways, retail stores and factories occupied.  We need to stop all global trade and transit for them to listen.  You must be willing to get arrested or beat or killed.   This is hardly a scary thought considering what will happen if we do nothing.
* if you have $500 to spare, go buy a junk car and on Sep 20, park it on the highway and cut the wires.  Make a blockade.  DO NOT SET IT ON FIRE.
* Don't go to work.  You work for your kids or for your own future, we don't have one, your kids don't have one, work is pointless now, get in the streets.
* If you're in a union, talk to your union representatives and get the union to join in, we need them.
* have a clear and concise message: Listen to the scientists, follow the suggestions of the IPCC report and de-carbonize the world in less than 11 years, otherwise, we will collapse the global economy.
* If you live in a place like China or The UK, cut down the surveillance towers.
* Do not wear masks, be proud of rebelling for the earth.
* Do not vandalize small businesses.
* Do not physically attack anyone.
* If this seems to much for you, but you still want to participate on the week of Sep 20.  Join Extinction Rebellions peaceful movement, or dedicate the week to an environmental cause or effort, planting trees, commuting with your bicycle etc etc.

Be ready to do this Sep 20, and be ready to continue to do this for years to come, we have the biggest battle of our lives coming up and no one is going to fight for us, no one is going to send us help, we have to fight climate apartheid with our bodies.

The leaders we have took us hostage and are driving us off a cliff, I'm talking the billionaire class, the CEO's and executive boards and the politicians, the consultant class, the war profiteers and slavers and almost the entire upper 3%, and they are showing absolutely no signs of slowing this train down, they are profiting more off the destruction of the environment than ever.  Instead of being proactive to address the carbon output problem, they are being reactionary, they are looking out for themselves personally,  [The government of Indonesia has a solution](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/indonesia-move-capital-jakarta-borneo-1.5259686)!  Move away from the ocean and say goodbye to all those who can't afford or aren't aware to move from Jakarta.     
 I suspect many governments will follow suit, they will abandon all the coastal cities and leave the people there to fend for themselves.   The American and British rust belts and Small towns were the ""sacrifice zones"" when global capital left the US for cheaper labour markets, now the coasts will be the ""sacrifice zones"".

&amp;#x200B;

In public the billionaires and the corporations and governments express skepticism about climate change, and therefor don't put any money into solutions to stop it, in private however, they all know the truth, Exxon knew about climate change since 1982, they published an internal document that predicted we would break 415ppm of carbon in the atmosphere by 2019 with warming of 0.9 degrees, we achieved both of these wonderful goals this year and in 2017 respectively, that same report predicts we will hit 3 degrees of warming by 2080, yet, Exxon and the rest of the oil companies still pumped billions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere.  The billionaire class aren't stupid, they aren't like your average science denier, these people got rich off science and data, they know the truth, which is why they are [building bunkers](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/doomsday-luxury-bunkers/index.html) to escape ""The Event"".

""The Event"" is the moment when climate catastrophe truly strikes us and there is no stabilizing of the rational order; the oceans have risen enough to push most or every coastal city into absolute chaos, worldwide trade breaks down(after all, how do you trade when all the ports are underwater?), billions of people migrating away from the coasts, droughts, floods and melted glaciers will lead to food and water shortages, this in turn could cause internecine civil wars, hundreds of millions of people are at risk of being starved to death or murdered, governments will commit genocide and set up concentration camps to figure out who gets fed and who doesn't, and the people that will suffer this tragic fate will be the global poor.  Oh, I shouldn't forget, possibly nuclear war over water and borders, lets hope Pakistan and India and China have rational leaders in 30-50 years.

* They are using our pension funds to burn down the amazon to put up pastureland.
* they applaud the melting of the Arctic zones as a ""new frontier for minerals and gas exploration"".
* they are committing a grand ecocide in the ocean, through toxic farm and animal waste, dumping plastic and fishing nets and overfishing to the point that there could be literally no fish left by 2040.
* Pollinator populations are dropping rapidly, this in turn will greatly reduce food outputs and natural flora growth, which in turn will wipe out hundreds of species of plant eating animals, the ecosystems of entire continents are being destabilized, for money.

they are doing absolutely everything in their power to ruin our chances for survival on this planet.  Their gift to you and me and our children is global eco-apocalypse.  

The world faces it's greatest danger and THEY STILL REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING, they have their G7s and G20s and quarterly board room meetings and trade talks and after party trade talks and their military interventions and their black operations and their corporate subsidies and they are all willing to wheel and deal when money is to be made, but they never talk about, fund, subsidize or have any military intervention when it comes to saving human being from a collapsing planet.  They drove this human experiment off the cliff on purpose for money and power and they destroyed every opportunity we had to stop this train so that they could eek out a few more dollars, they did this knowing it could lead to the deaths of billions of people and possibly destroy all life on earth and now they feel entitled to hide away in their bunkers and use their money to fund mars colonies and space arks while telling the rest of us to die in the streets.  Fuck them, they can't get away with this.  before we are finished fixing this mess, we need to imprison every person that has a hand in disinformation campaign about climate change, the billionaires and millionaires who profited off climate change and all the politicians who let them skate and probably took payments for doing so.  These people don't deserve their freedom after what they've done, it's quite possible that a future world will regard Oil and Gas companies as the worst mass murderers in human history (given that they've used the US military and mercenary armies to prosecute genocides to ""open up oil and gas markets"" I already give them that designation).   To be clear, the average Joe working in coal or in O&amp;G doesn't deserve any punishment, they are just average people trying to feed their families.

My viewpoint is ""hes not a good leader. We should replace him"" that's about it. This isnt meant to be a trump discussion, but for transparency, I figured I'd put it out there.

What do we have to do to save the planet for future generations? As an American, I feel that we have a responsibility to, at the very least, play an important role in this. Not because i have an American flag tattoo on my ass, or that I have a pet bald eagle, but because this is a global issue...and globally, we have quite a bit of influence in how this planet is run. We also have quite a few people that want to take a crack at this ""save the planet"" perspective...like Bernie Sanders. Even if we were theoretically to go with a plan like Bernie's (and disregard how this might negatively impact the average US citizen; as someone who lives  in a low income area of the US, (yes....depending on the region, we can be very uneducated) best case scenario, the US goes green. It doesnt stop any country like China or India from continuing their massively  environmentally destructive way of life.

I guess my whole opinion is that (shocklingly) the welfare of our planet...involves all humans...regardless of borders, race, gender, or financial wellbeing. And at the current state the planet is in, we are letting short term success dictate the future of an entire species.

The Amazon not only provides oxygen for a planet that currently deforests at an alarming rate. (Yes I know there are movements to reforest, and I think they're amazing humanitarian efforts. However, those trees will take decades to grow to maturity. So without them being fully mature, how does that impact our current environment?  (genuinely asking)

So at what point do we (in theory) pitch the idea of a global council. Every country that cares about the future of the human race, decides to participate. If you dont, then you are assumed to be an enemy of the planet. I realize this sounds quite radical, but try telling this to a generation of children that dont exist because our environmental negligence prevented them from being born in the first place 

I'm sure this post will be looked over. I dont claim to be the first person to say this. I'm certainly not a scientist. I certainly dont have the answers. And that's my point. How long do we wait for BS like the amazon completely burning down before we, as a planet, decide to care not only about the state of our country's borders, and instead the state of our entire species?What do we do?"

This article informs readers of the negative impact the electronic supply chain is having on our planet and how you can improve it.

According to www.thebalancesmb.com only 15-20 percent of e-waste is recycled which is extremely low. Over the past decade there has been an increase in environmental concern worldwide. This concern has grown due to regular environmental protests, social media trends such as ‘trash tag’ where people collect as much rubbish as they can, environmental activists obstructing day to day activities and video campaigns showing the damage that pollution has done to our planet.

&gt; ""***A job****, employment, work or occupation,* ***is a person's role in society***.""  - Wikipedia

Your occupation is not only what you do, but also what the company you work for does. What I am trying to say here is that your current job is determining your role in society. 

Pretty important, right?

Many of us are aware of the climate and environmental crisis we are going through, and we know that the economical system as it is now, is not sustainable and it is destroying our planet, our home. This is why many of us eco-conscious people are trying hard to keep an eco-friendly lifestyle by changing the way we consume. The idea behind this is that by changing the demand we will change the supply. Not bad, however, this it is not enough. The next thing we are also doing is supporting ecological projects around us or even going into digital or physical activism. 

Conscious consumers and activists are great and necessary, but I think we are still forgetting something.

Before I  carry on, I would like to ask you employees or contractors a few questions: 

1. Who do you work for? What does your company do? What is their mission and what are their emissions?
2. Have you ever considered changing jobs and spend your working day helping to build a more sustainable world?
3. If you have tried to do that, how hard did you find it? If you have not, do you believe the process will be long winded and hard work?

As I was trying to say, leading the change by example is key, but it is not enough if we do it only as end consumers. As workers we are also producers, and with our time and talent, we are contributing to our employers success. If these companies are big polluters, then we are serving the enemy, not fighting them. 

I will give you a few examples:

1. *PersonA* embraces a ZeroWaste lifestyle. This person works as an accountant for a disposable cups manufacturer. They are producing, on a large scale, what they are trying to stop on a smaller scale.
2. *PersonB* is concerned about the plastic in the ocean. They work as a waiter in a beach bar where they serve everything in single use plastics and make use of straws. Smoking is also permitted but there are not enough ashtrays.
3. *PersonC* is conscious about carbon emissions and tries to use public transport to commute to work. Everyday they  share articles on social media about environmental issues and car pollution. This person is a flight attendant.

Employees are one of the biggest assets of a company. Without employees, a company cannot grow, nor succeed.

Everyday I imagine a world where we conscious consumers stop buying from big polluters AND we workers also stop working for them. 

That thought hit me a couple of years ago, right after I started hitting rock bottom due to an existential crisis and something I like to call EcoAnxiety. I promised myself that, although I didn't know what to do, I would only work for an ecological purpose. I knew my role in society was going to be helping ecology win the battle for the good of humanity and Earth. I knew what companies I did not want to work for, and I knew that if I failed in my decision, I would feel miserable.

I then started my hunt for a job within my skill set which agreed with my environmental values. It ended up being impossible. I found sustainability job sites, but most of them were only offering jobs for environmental scientists or engineers. Job offerings on these kind of sites were very focused within the water and energy industries. 

I kept trying, and I kept learning. I read a lot about our current economical system (which is my field), I discovered Circular economy, Green economy, Blue economy, Ecological economy and many alternative ways to thrive in life without putting our planet on risk. 

&gt;*""The* ***green economy*** *is defined as* ***economy***  *that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities,  and that aims for sustainable development without degrading the  environment.""* \- Wikipedia

This economy is a transversal area within all industries, and there it offers a big variety of jobs for all kinds of companies participating in the green transition. I recently started researching and discovering projects and organisations that are really making a change and I'd like to encourage all you eco-conscious people to have a look as well.

Following my dream of a sustainable world, where people would consciously choose what to consume and who to work for, I started this new project called **EmploGreen**. It's a job board which aims to help companies and professionals find each other in the complex world of green economy and sustainability.

 

    P.S.: If you find EmploGreen interesting, subscribe for updates.

First of all, I created this throwaway handle to avoid people using my history as an excuse to not contribute.

Here, I am asking people for contribution towards Cauvery Calling campaign which is aiming to shift at least 30% of farmers in Cauvery river basin towards agro-forestry which will help farmers, soil health, and ground water level.

Entire project will be managed by eminent citizens such as retired Supreme Court Judge, ISRO chairman and such. Details can be found [here](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/board-members) .

I would request this community to contribute to this cause. It takes just 42 Indian Rupees to plant one tree (which include s taking care of sapling and planting it in farmer's field). Go through this small 3-minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kHwdveBGQk) to find out how this money will be utilized. This campaign has backing of many countries and [UNITED NATIONS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I77yHcKA1eo).

Though you can donate directly, but I would like some of you to donate through this [LINK](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-1429?action=2) . It will help this one particular volunteer reach the pledged goal of 1000 trees. Volunteers or fund raisers **DO NOT** get anything from it, money goes directly to Campaign's account handled by above mentioned committee and audit report will be published. Donating through this [link](https://www.ishaoutreach.org/en/cauvery-calling/campaigns/cauvery-calling-action-now-1429?action=2) may just help a volunteer reach their personal goal.  

India's firs female IPS officer and current Governor of Puducherry [Kiran Bedi](https://twitter.com/thekiranbedi/status/1163812509712695297?s=19) also supports this campaign.

Donors will get **receipt** in their mail and are eligible to claim **tax exemption under 80-G of Income Tax Act**.

0,"Recently I saw a video in which while talking about global warming and climate change they claimed that the war against this environmental issues could somehow be related with what we know as class struggle, and I believe it would be interesting to see what people think about this. 

They gave a series of explanations to support this idea:

\-Those who will suffer the consequences of living in a warm and polluted planet more drastically are the same people who at this moment live in the most underdeveloped regions of the world (Africa, South America... etc) both because of the fact that here the effects will be more visible and because of the lack of resources to deal with this. At the same time, in other countries where the economy is more prosperous, those who live in precarious conditions (lower classes) will find it harder to adapt to living in a warmer environment where food could get more expensive, having an air conditioner could become a must, and working outdoors while suffering this extremely warm weather would be a new obstacle for people like farmers or laborers to overcome. Meanwhile those with more money and a ´´comfortable´´ job (higher classes) won´t suffer as much.

\-Both governments and owners of the means of productions have in their hands the chance of taking decissions that could make great changes in this situation. It is mainly because of their actions in the past that we are now living this plight, and their actions in the present and future will be crucial to get out of it. Therefore citizens and consumers should cooperate and fight to alter the choices governments and owners take in order to survive in the future. Sadly, this means that we might be comming to the point where ´´fighting the power´´ could be a neccesary step if fighting for survival.

\-Last but not least I would like to highlight the fact that people who lead a lifestyle of unnecessary consumption and excesses and are thereupon more guilty of this things happening will not suffer the consequences of their own actions as much as those who probably did not have anything to do with the global warming. 

**Thoughts?**

&gt;As most of you know, the amazon has been on fire for the last 3 weeks. The impact on the environment is enormous. We NEED trees to remove c02 from the air and to create oxygen. In fact, scientists have very recently stated that more trees would slow down climate change.    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately there isn’t much we can do for the Amazon right now. But there is something we can do to offset the damage – plant trees. If you’re like me and do not own land, what you can do instead is write your local representatives, colleges, businesses, and push them to prioritize reforestation (government) or to even plant trees.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If we can get this movement viral and trending, we absolutely can make a positive difference. Every tree counts, who knows how else this can evolve?  We have to try. we as a generation NEED to take action and do something. forget the corporate elitists who don't give a shit about the environment, they won't do anything for us.

The government has radically reduced environmental enforcement, made speeches justifying deforestation, and recently blamed NGOs, which were allegedly setting fire to the forest to tarnish the image of the president - frivolous indictment without any evidence.

Bees are dying at much higher levels than usual due to very strong pesticides (banned in the EU) now authorized by the Brazilian government.

Half of the people are blinded by anger against communism (which never existed in Brazil) and corruption (which has always existed and continues to exist). The people are also giving up labor and social security rights with the promise of an improvement in the economy.

It also means that local products will become cheaper, and therefore buying local will be a more attractive option for consumers.

Brazil's Amazon rainforest has seen a record number of forest fires but the one that is currently blazing acres of land is said to be the biggest forest fire on the planet. The damage done by this fire is so massive that the smoke can be seen from space! **Nasa** recently released images of the fire and its impact from space. The Amazon rainforest is the biggest rainforest on this planet and it is responsible for producing large quantities of oxygen. As the wildfire spreads, it will drastically increase the global temperature of the planet over time. There has been a tremendous loss of flora and fauna in the Amazon rainforest and a number of species of flora and fauna are endangered by this blaze.

I cant sleep, if I happen to read about it or I start to cry or I get SOOO angry that I only want to cry (I always cry). So I need some advice on what should I be feeling, actions that could help amazon (we, brazilians, r very connected to nature and I feel our nature, what mother earth gave us, os going away n never to return). 

Then I remember, that it'll never grow back, bc the same location in Africa, burned (they also had a rainforest there) and never returned.

I hve no 1 to talk to, my only option is my mom: she'll think that I'm overreacting or that only bc she loves the rainforest ""more"" than me, that means that I don't love the rainforest.

And the worst part is that the Forest gives us oxygen!!!

So my question is: is there any way to make the ppl n our super shitty president know that this should be stopped? Or any meditation or something like that to help me live while our most important rainforest is one fire? Or maybe try to talk to my mom (shes having her on breakdown right now)?

So, while writing this post, I hve a solution for half of my problems (pls respond all my questions above) when school starts again, I'll talk to my science teacher or English teacher (I'm in a country that speaks english) about it, and I'll se if I can do projects to present to the school regarding it.

Here was my response because I don’t want to write everything again:

Sorry, that’s just absolute bs. China sure. India? They don’t even create half the carbon emissions of the US, and they have 4x the population.

The EU emits significantly more carbon than India with less than half the population.

Who is next? Russia Japan Germany South Korea Iran Saudi Arabia Canada Indonesia

I could go on, the only country in Africa even close to the top of the list is South Africa, and I get the sneaking suspicion that its demography precludes them from the countries you were thinking of but I would be more than happy if I were wrong.

“But per capita...”

1.	⁠The climate doesn’t care about per capita emissions. All that matters is net emissions, and per capita emissions are only relevant for assigning responsibility geopolitically, or in your case, trying to abandon responsibility.
2.	⁠Also, you would just be wrong again were you to make this argument. China is below New Zealand in per capita emissions, and I am not going to count 40+ countries down the list to find exactly how far down they are.
3.	⁠African countries? None in the top thirty. The highest in per capita emissions in Africa is South Africa, and I really don’t think that was a country you were referring to.
4.	⁠India is nowhere to be seen in terms of per capita pollution.
5.	⁠High income countries lead per capita emissions by a strong margin.

Carbon emissions are not all that matter of course. Methane and other pollutants are also relevant. You can guess how the American agricultural/chemical industry affects our numbers on those fronts.

Individual Americans and Europeans aren’t to blame. I agree, with exception for the political structures that we vote for which enable industrial environmental carelessness and exploitation.

It’s not about who is ‘technically marginally more responsible for climate impact’ even if that were the case, which it isn’t, it is about what we have power to change, and as the second most co2 emitting country, that is a lot to be changed.

From dismissing entirely evidence provided by members of his own cabinet, to blaming NGOs with no evidence of their current problems, as well as giving the green light for the destruction of large parts of the forest, it seems that there is no way to correct this man.

0,"Hello all,

Since hybrids are more fuel-efficient, it is largely agreed that they are a better environmental choice than traditional gasoline. However, since hybrids create more emissions during production, and gasoline vehicles are becoming more fuel-efficient, it raises some questions. For example, a 2019 Rav gets about 30mpg combined and a rav4 hybrid gets about 40mpg combined, does this 25% difference in efficiency makes up for the more intensive manufacturing process? Is there any way to know for sure? I would love to hear your thoughts.

How can we - we being the rest of the world that needs the Amazon to be protected - pool together and purchase the Amazon on behalf of a world environmental trust?  We could hand management back to the indigenous tribes but put an international group together to oversee and monitor it. 

What would it be worth to Brazil's economy?  Surely someone can work that out, obviously it's worth something to those farmers that are slash/burn clearing it.

Firstly, I am not incredibly informed about these forest fires currently going on. This may also be a stupid question but I have been wondering this since it has been on the news. 

I live in Canada, and during the summer months it seems we are constantly dealing with forest fires. Sometimes these are controlled burns, other times they are not. While they are concerning, the general public seems to care more about this current forest fire in Brazil. Could anyone explain why this seems to be more alarming then the “regular” forest fires we seem to get in Canada?Question about Amazonian forest fires?"
0,"Norway has stopped all future payments to the Amazon fund ($1.2B fund in total - its majority has been contributed by Norway). Germany has also suspended its payments to the fund (payments will be on 'pause' until Bolsonaro changes his policy towards the Amazon's deforestation). 

The fund was primarily used as an incentive to preserve the Amazon and to reward Brazil for responsible behavior. However, since Bolsonaro has taken an aggressive step in the opposite direction, Norway and Germany have halted future contributions (for now) to the fund. 

More countries, *especially* those privy to the Paris Agreement, need to speak up and shift future economic investment away from Brazil because MONEY TALKS. 

Norway and Germany are ahead of the curve, and are leading by example.

The more economic pressure put on Bolsonaro, the more likely that he will **not** be re-elected in 2023 (he can be renewed for one more 4-year term). This is the goal.

**Please voice your opinion**, and focus to keep this news ALIVE - the more people that google, like, comment, and share posts related to the Amazon and its deforestation the more profitable it will be for the media to pick it up. The more that this stays in the media, the more attention it will receive worldwide which increases the likelihood of countries intervening economically.Norway stops Amazon fund contribution in dispute with Brazil - More countries need to follow their lead!!!"

Since the 1960s, plastic production has increased by approximately 8.7% annually, evolving into a $600 billion global industry. Approximately eight million metric tons of plastics enter the oceans annually. In a few million years the only evidence that humans ever existed will be a thin film of nano-plastics.

The millions of tons of plastic in oceans gets a lot of media attention recently. But plastic pollution poses a bigger threat to land plants and animals – including humans. Micro- and nanoplastic is even in the air you breathe. It's in everything you eat drink and breathe.

Plastics don't chemically breakdown, they just get physically smaller and smaller. When they shrink to a certain size, they become toxic sponges, absorbing a wide variety of toxic materials. Each week humans eat enough plastic to make up a credit card. There are 52 weeks to a year. It's like eating 52 credit cards each year on your birthday. There's nothing you can do about, so sit back and enjoy the cake. 

Eventually the plastic is broken down to nanoparticles, which may be an even more potent threat since plastic nanoparticles are able to pass through biological barriers, penetrate tissues and accumulate in organs and affect behaviour and metabolism of organisms. 

The uptake of nanoplastic particles by algae, and their transport up the food chain, affects the brain physiology and behaviour of top consumer fish. Humans are a top consumer.

Scientists ignore the precautionary principle because of money. That's why no educated idiot could prove cigarettes kill you in a court or hearing room, even though us uneducated idiots knows they do. The first plastic was bakelite, it was a heavy, strong, brittle material that made early 20th century phones. The Talented Mr. Ripley is a movie about the corruption of wealth and greed, based on the heirs to the bakelite fortune.

Frogs and toads differ and tend to be [amphibians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian), meaning they’re able to live in and from water. They both vertebrates and fit in with the class which includes salamanders. But while salamanders look a lot more like lizards with long bodies and tails, both frogs and toads are short-bodied and tail-less, hence their Greek name “anura.”

They also develop just like, from being mostly born as eggs, living under water as larvae or tadpoles, then living on both water and land as adults. They both have vocal cords too and will even make sounds under water. Plus, both must breed and lay their eggs in water.

But this is where the similarities end. The most obvious way frogs and toads differ is by using their skin. Frogs have smooth, wet, and velvety (or slimy) skin because they usually stay quite near the water. The toad is much more adventurous and travels from the water, leading to dry, warty skin.

Frogs tend to lay their eggs in bodies of water without fish. These eggs form a rounded shape. Toad eggs taste nasty and may come in inhabited bodies of water. They usually undertake an extended chain-like shape.

Sir Isaac Newton is that a name who singlehandedly changed the definition of science. He was a mathematician, an astronomer, an author, a historian, a theologian as well as a philosopher at the same time! Today he is considered one among those greatest scientists the world has ever seen so far. And here we are going to unveil 20 facts about him, which people hardly heard of before! 

 **1.** We know the story of the discovery of Gravity. But scholars think the story to be tale made famous by the French writer Voltaire. However, a group of scholars think the story to be partly true.

**2.** There was Newton’s sketch in the first-ever logo of the Apple company. The sketch was about the moment when Newton sat under an apple tree and an apple was about to fall down on him and he was going to have ideas of gravity.

**3.** In the year 1665, the plague was spread out in the various parts of England. Newton was then studying in the Trinty College in Cambridge. The college authority sent him home along with his mates. Fortunately, the period turned out to be very productive for Newton. He discovered Calculus and some laws of physics which we call Newtonian Physics today.

**4.** In the early years of discoveries, Newton was somewhat introvert about his works. He used to hide his inventions lest people thought him wrong and things went adverse.

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: Infoqwiki.com](https://i.redd.it/oytjq8t5h4h31.png)

**5.** Despite being a scientist he was a religious person. And it is proved where he himself wrote, “Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.”

**6.** Though he was theist he never believed in the existence of satan, ghost or spirit.

**7.** Newton was seriously fascinated by the Bible. He immensely went through the Bible. However, he wrote about religion and history much more than science!

**8.** After reading the Bible, Newton predicted that Jesus had been crucified exactly on 3 April 33 AD.

**9.** He firmly believed that the universe will not destroy before 2060.

**10.** It’s said that Newtone foretold that the Jews would again regain their land. And it has proven true!

**11.** His interest in the Bible made him learn the Hebrew language so that he could realize the profound meaning of the religion! Surprisingly, he spent almost half of his working life on deciphering religion!

**12.** Sir Isaac Newton was born in the year when Galileo Galilei passed away!

**13.** Newton was born prematurely. His size and weight were so less that he could be placed in a mug! Chances of his survival were very uncertain at that time.

**14.** The father’s name of Sir Isaac Newton was also Isaac Newton.

**15.** Newton’s father died 3 months before his birth.

**16.** Newton remained unmarried in his entire life.

**17.** Newton was born to a farmer’s family. His mother wanted him to be a farmer. But Newton did not like farming at all!

**18.** Newton was the first among those scientists who told the earth is not round but Elliptical.

**19.** The descendant of the apple tree in which the idea of gravity came from is reserved in present England. However, the original tree was ruined between 1815 and 1820.

**20.** A piece of wood of the apple tree along with Sir Isaac Newton’s photograph has been sent to space as a message to the aliens!20 Facts about Sir Isaac Newton What Leave You a Flabbergasted! 😲"

So we're college students and we go for outings almost every weekend. I was thinking of planting trees/plants in the barren and deserted lands that we often find in our way to places. I know that the probability of them growing well is less but if they do, in some of the places i planted them, then wouldn't it be a great success and an amazing contribution!?!?     

I know I would have to keep a lot of things in mind and I dont even know if its a good idea or not. Please help me by pointing out some factors that I should take care of and how can I make this plan better. 
TIA.Can this idea of growing trees work?"

0,"Hello.  So I'm a first time poster, and had a question in regards to this.  

I've done very well for myself financially speaking, and have come into ownership of a large sum of money.  Recently I thought of the possibility, of buying a plot of land, and growing plants in it.  Similar to a small park or something.  I want to make my life style carbon negative, or at least carbon neutral.

However, unfortunately I have not studied this field very much.  

I was wondering just how realistic of a goal is this?  How much land would I need?  Are there other considerations I'll need to consider?

Also what plants should I try to grow?  I have read that bamboo is the best option for this kind of goal, due to how quickly it grows (absorbing more carbon).  But I live in the United States, and I do not believe bamboo can grow in most of the country.

Admittedly a part of me feels a bit naive about all of this, but I'm curious what others had to say.

Editorial:

The Wealth Dividend
---

Big tech is trying to greenwash society. It's the ultimate mind control. Monsanto makes GMO seeds which destroys both soil and intestinal life. The microscopic life in the soil feeds the microscopic life in your guts. GMOs destroy both of them. They do this so they can spray bug and plant poison on them that destroys insects, birds, fish and weeds. The only thing that lives in a green field is the plant modified to survive extreme poison. Monsanto paid Google to derank those poisons. For every story they smother, there's another story they promote, for more money. They're like information brokers, they get paid win or lose, even if it's lose-lose for us.

Germany and northern Europe are the green energy white collar mafia. They burn plastic and paper and call it recycled energy. Their cap and trade carbon credits are a racketeering fraud for fossil fuel corporations and banks. Solar and wind power are 100% fraud. Germany is calling Greta's treehouse gal pal a terrorist. Germany uses solar wind power to build diesel cars that burn palm oil. Germany is razing its own villages and old forests to burn dirty brown coal, to run their solar and wind power. They get 50% of their renewable electricity burning forests imported from around the world. We give them trees, they give us cars. Germany's Bayer bought Monsanto and Deutsche Bank is a $50 trillion dollar time bomb. Northern Europe is the green energy equivalent of Peter Pan with a Hitler moustache.

If we continue with 10 more years of this fraud the earth will die. It won't be better off without us, unless we're subterranean bacteria. There's a 3% chance this won't happen, at most. They tell us we have a 60% chance, but they're ignorant liars. This is because we allow the wealthy to make up the rules that enslave us for their greed. IMO, only a 100% private wealth dividend will prevent total civil chaos. If I were a credentialed expert in civil chaos, I would get paid to calm you down and de-escalate the situation. This is what Google gets paid to do. Google news is the same size as the 5 media outfits that own 90% of our news.

Greed is motivating us to use money to outsmart ourselves. It's another denial projection. It's like when a woman pounds on the protagonist's breast in rage before she kisses him -- like in old movies. It's the outrageous rage of denial wrapped up in the sanctity of race and class. I recommend a strong does of 100% private wealth dividends, with a 100% universal basic income worldwide -- before civil chaos strikes the land of machine guns. Both sides are greedy and power mad, and victory is never without total and absolute consequence. Just sayin.

The top greenwashed product in the world is your mind, what we used to call our soul.

0,"I’m a vegan myself, but sometimes I ask myself this question. I also thought it was better suited for this sub because I do think it requires more knowledge of the environment and what impacts it.

I often see statistics and statements like “the meat and dairy industry have a much higher environmental impact than other non-animal reliant industries.” While this is absolutely true, this is also probably because there are way more people in the world who consume these products than there are people who do not. So if we did completely cut out this industries somehow, wouldn’t that just place more stress on soy/bean/substitute sources? Maybe even enough to completely replace the impact?

Secondly, I see many other vegans arguing that although the soy industry is detrimental to South America, only a small amount of it is actually going to soy products, while the rest is being used to feed animals to be slaughtered. Ok, true. However, as I previously stated, there are many less vegans than non-vegans in the world. If we stopped consuming animals/raising soy for animals, our consumption of soy might rise high enough to completely replace the impact. 

Is there any merit to these ideas? Or am I wrong? Trust me, I’d like to be wrong, but I’m just not sure.People say that vegan is is better for the environment, but is that really true?"

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act allows local authorities (e.g. state governments) the ability to certify (or fail to certify) that their water quality will not be impacted by a federal permitted project. This rule is aimed particularly at states and Native American tribes that have delayed or blocked gas pipelines using this Section, using indirect arguments that fracking causes added risk of groundwater contamination, the use of natural gas leads to worsened climate change and subsequently harm to water resources, erosion during the construction phase leads to sedimentation and pollution of water bodies, and several others. The new rule will allow only direct “point source” pollution from the pipelines to be considered, effectively stripping the power from entities like New York or various tribes that have blocked pipelines, and preventing consideration of some very real water quality threats posed by pipeline construction. 

Additionally, it will only allow a one-year period to issue a water quality certification, meaning there will now be less time to conduct a proper study of water quality impacts by a proposed project, among other problems.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is supposed to regulate pipelines for the effects of climate change per NEPA, but that commission is currently dominated by Trump appointees. Section 401 of the CWA was a measure that allowed local authorities some measure of voice in protecting their water quality.EPA Proposes new Rule to Streamline Section 401 of Clean Water Act, Fast-Tracking Natural gas Pipelines and Limiting State Power"

0,"I'm honestly terrified by those, since it means that the warming will accelerate to points where any effort to lower or mitigate it will be impossible and that there is no hope anymore.

Even the cloud loss scares me, if it's as bad as people say it is.

This has led by to give in and accept that all of us are going to look forward to a future similar to ""The Road"" in or lifetime and we will experience it. I mean many of us have a lifespan that goes as far as the 2080's.

Though then again someone here said that those lops were debunked and disproven. 


/u/ClimateNurse had this to say about them:


- Not exactly. Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.


For the methane hydrates/methane bomb shebang...In Svalbard, where there is a particularly notable clathrate eruption and bubbling, was discovered to be happening for at least 8000 years, and erupted likely due to water depth changes, as it is on a continental slope.


More than likely this is one of the few events where this can occur, as methane hydrates must be under high pressure at high depths, where warning from the sea floor, which is dramatically colder than the air, must reach it to destabilize it. On top of that, even in shallow areas, fluctuations in temperature have not destabilized them. Even should they be destabilized (which would take a long, long while), Shakova et al., the team where the methane bomb theory originated, found that much of it went directly into the water and dissolved. Given this, methane releases would be small, given it is [quite soluble already in water, and research by Shakova &amp; more backs this up.] (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RvGeo..55..126R) The methane bomb theory was aided by the team extrapolating how much methane release was there due to it dissolving, therefore spawning an inaccurate number of how much methane is actually venting from there. (Plus, it's hard to concentrate and find out how much)


A 15 Gt burst (1% of permafrost in nothing but methane. This... Isn't plausible one bit) (the 50 Gt burst is described in Edit 2) would give us a heating of 1C for a short duration, 0.4C in long-term. Various scientists such as Gavin Schmidt, cast doubt on this quite frequently, saying it is incredibly unlikely. For actual permafrost, we can likely expect some variation. .5C under high emissions scenarios (closer to RCP 8.5), with some saying a bit lower, or around .3-.4C at the same time. The same study just linked also says under low emissions scenarios we'd expect .15C but due to various melt collapses (thermokarsts), this is up for debate. But thermokarst studies predicts less by 2100, under high emission scenarios, yet others predict (only for low emission scenarios) double the warming, making it closer to .3C.


Due to arctic sea ice loss already, we've been facing .11C extra of heating, or .2 W/m^-2.


If we lose summer arctic sea ice, we can face an estimated .16C, or .3 W/m^-2.


If it is furthered in extent (year round), we are expected to get .35C total (counting the .11C we are already facing). This is where things get...Tricky.


So, cloud albedo plays a role in negating warming- but how much, we don't know. Sea ice loss increases cloud cover by 81% over these areas consistently, potentially reducing the feedback (and being 2-3x better than sea ice).It may also provide negligible reduction, or be a positive feedback. There's a lot of variability here, but it isn't going to be a big mass heating in an instant. It'd be gradual as the ice goes away more and more, particularly as we get closer to an ice-free arctic.


For it to happen -this- year, well...We'd have to see a graph like this. Which is very, very, very unlikely. We'll probably track closer to 2012 this year, and for the next...Who knows? There is a -lot- of variabiliy with it.


- The aerosol masking effect is a big cluster of a...Mess, really.


Some predict .4C, but the most common one I see thrown around on Reddit is 1C, but people never seem to note that it is by 2100, and under a specific RCP scenario, rather than what is currently masked. A majority of models indicate lower levels, or around .5C. Various comments from climate scientists also say this.


However, aerosols aren't just black and white like most people say they are- and they're not all from fossil fuel emissions. Some are from agriculture, others from fires, others from fossil fuels (not counting the natural ones). Some also heat the world, rather than cool it, but the variety of places that they come from make it unlikely that we'll see them vanish rapidly.


- Not a good thing, for certain. But it wouldn't be an instant one either, as a reminder.


Dieback (which would happen at ~+3-5°C anyway), would happen over decades (if not longer), but this isn't accounting for deforestation in addition to this. It's important to realize it wouldn't just explode out a lot of carbon!


Forest dieback is defined as trees losing health, and is the decline of a forest after a point has been reached. A lot can go into it, such as pests, disease, etc., but it's nonetheless a progressive or premature loss of trees. They can be in specific areas, elevations, perimeters, etc.


Likely, it would eventually become a net source rather than sink over time, as weve seen with other dying forests, then start to fade away into a Savannah, as predicted. CO2 release due to this would be gradual, rather than instant.


...But the capacity of it isn't nice.


Edit: I'm going to do some more research as OPs links say that it could produce 140 years of human emissions (sounds off to me, even if is from the rainforest trust. But there's a lot of factors at play so im gonna check what others say! I could be wrong.) Also, edited my figures.


PREPARE FOR MATH.


It turns out the Hothouse Earth paper covered this a little, too! (from 2018) So, this paper estimates by 2100 that the Amazon rainforest dieback will add .05°C, under 2C of warming. It has a range of .03-.11°C, BUT is based on extrapolations of observed changes in diebacks and model projections. The total CO2 estimate released by 2100 is also around 15-55 GtC.


2014 articles from Journal of Ecology (posting on mobile, reading on desktop, will post articles here eventually) and the sources used for the Hothouse Earth paper line up with this. So, this seems to support the idea that it will be VERY drawn out. The worst case scenarios run with 24-40% biomass shrinkage by 2100. (15-25 GtC).


I ran some conversions on the claims by rainforest trust as well, w/ 140 billion tons being 127 Gt. I'm...Confused but also bad at math, so someone correct me if I'm wrong here. For reference, humanity releases ~42 GtC per year. Their math lines up with the Hothouse Earth paper w/ how much carbon is stored (they estimated 150-200 GtC).


A rough calculation of GtC to ppm is about (from the IPCC)


1ppm CO2 = 2.12 GtC = 7.76 GtCO2.
So: 1GtCO2 = .127ppm CO2
1GtC = .47 ppm CO2.
1ppm = 0.0046875C.


We see about a 3ppm rise per year, but this also is on a delay. So even the warming released from this would be delayed for a LONG while. It'd add in the end about ~90+-5 ppm, so it'd be in the current roughly 31 years of human emissions by ppm per year, but a bit over 3 by our total emissions per year. (a lot of our emissions are absorbed by the ocean primarily!) This warming would be delayed by a good bit and vary in the end, as we also have a delay in our emissions (.2°C/decade), so this is a lot of complexity, and this also presumes it'd be instant release -and- all released.


So, if the Amazon were to poof and release all of its CO2, it'd end up warming us by around .45C! (used 95 ppm as a reference).


However, this assumes all of it would be in the atmosphere and not in the oceans/vegetation/etc. Humans still will release far more, nonetheless!


Nonetheless, the dieback would likely be due to the fact that the rainforest is a self sustaining system, and after a certain point it would probably start to struggle. Combine that with a changing climate and you've got this. It'd be over a long period, but be irreversible.

Okay, having to rewrite this as I closed the page clicking to a paper to link. Whoops.

To quickly summarize (by 2100)
Permafrost + Methane = .15-.5C (.5C being RCP 8.5, methane hydrates ignored because they're not quite a threat)
Forest fires (boreal forest) = .02-.10C
Amazon dieback realistically = .03-.11C
Land sink change = .13-.27C


https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/suppl/2018/07/31/1810141115.DCSupplemental/pnas.1810141115.sapp.pdf


Carbon sinks also vary greatly depending on where they're at, what they are, how they'll be affected, what warming we'll hit, etc. So that is also too tricky to put into a singular post. The ocean is also one of our biggest carbon sinks, and absorbs a -lot-. Most of our emissions go into it, rather than vegetation.


I can't cover the carbon cycle much (if at all), as that's a bit out of my depth. I'll bug a climate scientist for sure, but I imagine it'd be similar to other feedbacks- over time, relatively small compared to human emissions.


- Methane is (typically) overplayed a lot, and is in relation to short-term effects.

-  I've had the 1.6C claim thrown at me recently, so I was curious if it was from the same source. (It was from the temperature anomaly + estimated aerosol masking from the current date, though I've also had other baselines used, vs. what is commonly used- 1850-1900). The IPCC has gotten ice sheet melt wrong by a good measure, but observed warming has been incredibly accurate to date (with minor deviations above average). There's always going to be some deviation in predicted warming, which could also have added to this (they estimated .8C to 1.2C, with an average of 1C warming in the AR5 report.)


For temperatures to rise that high, we'd have to be far beyond...Well, any understandings of the climate, and forgo our observations to date (as our observations are very in-line with CMIP5 modeling), and presume that the climate ECS is far higher than what it is observed to be, or could be- even with the new model estimates.


For presuming averages, we have to take into account land &amp; sea changes, and for the IPCC/Paris Agreement '1.5C', it must be an average of 1.5C over a certain period of time, rather than the average hitting this. (There's a lot of factors that go into consideration of the average, will dig it up when I can!) The average on some years -has- breached 1C repeatedly (the average from observations in 2017 was 1.2C!), but this was expected due to anomalies.



- A: GMOs can and will bridge the gap eventually.

​

B: Current biodiversity decline is largely due to horrible management of agriculture and pesticides. Those 2 stop we will see significant drops in species dying. Climate change is still an issue obviously but it's not the reasons species are rapidly dying. And just so you know *we are not in the 6th mass extinction*.


Not sure if i should feel better or event rust this at all. because me, like most people concerned about this believe we will see this on our lifetime, are depressed by it and feel hopeless about it. Thinking of the horrible deaths as well as the utter grief of seeing society collapse before our very eyes. Many of us are contemplating suicide even as they are unwilling to live long enough to see that happen.

Heck even much of us accepted and resigned that as the future as governments and corporations do nothing about it or oppose action against it in the face of activism and mounting public concern. Even the people guilty of inaction as they are unwilling to change their lifestyles or are unaware of the concern or even straight up deny  or dismiss it. either saying it wont affect them or having swallowed up the climate denial junk being generated by the right wing and the corporate propagandists. 

I dont know if if they are really as bad as what the articles, and people (including scientists) say but I feel that I will live to see the collapse of society and the extinction of Mankind within my lifetime or even earlier (either in the 2030s or even as early as the 2020s) thanks to the feedback loops. I'm even anticipating the Water Crisis (Nothing is being done to address the drying wells) as well as the collapse of the agricultural system and the famines it will produce thanks to bees going extinct and land becoming unusable as predicted in the IPCC report recently.


Given AR6 report is to be published this December 31st. I'm merely expecting more bad news or straight up ""The window has closed and any attempt now is impossible and the 2030 deadline has shortened"". Especially since this time around. Feedback loops will be taken into account. i can only imagine the disappointment these activists and all of us will have once its stated that it's either impossible at this point or it's too big to even handle anymore. The distraught and grief of them having to face a post apocalyptic world in their lifetime as there is nothing they can do anymore I hope we all accept what's coming and hope we at least die as swiftly, quietly, and as painlessly as possible. we al fear death dont we? And many of us fear a death from disease, starvation thirst and ehat stroke from this. or even getting killed by other survivors when society collapses. I'm even having nightmares of aimlessly wandering around a post apocalyptic world and then dying from hunger, thirs, and the intense heat from the  uncontrolled warming.

Those feedback loops don't make climate change like boiling a frog. It's more ike dying from a terminal sickness that rapidly gets faster.

It's hard if not impossible to have hope and make a difference when the thing you are fighting against increasingly accelerates faster than expected to the point where the deadline is going to hit you like a brick wall.Are the Feedback loops as bad as they say they are?"

Other say it's because they are scared of the future, they don't want to bring kids to a world a lot harder than theirs. I won't judge them cause I know that is a difficult decision. Having to go through peer pressure (from family, friends and society) is hard, and any instinct they may have that tells them to reproduce. But I want to talk about people that thibks we are going to solve this jusr by not having kids.

Whenever i browse other subs like worldnews and there is a catastrophic enviromental news (there has been a lot of those lately), some people comments that they won't have kids like that is supposed to solve everything. It's like a cop out. They think that by not having kids, they have the license to continue their lavish life styles.

Well, in terms of CO2 emissions, I bet a single american or european person accounts for an entire family living in a third world country. Sure, not having kids reduces your carbon footprint by **a lot**, but we are still consuming more resources than the planet is capable of.

Sadly, there is no silver bullet on solving this crisis. There is no single action we can do and call it a day.Discussion: Not having kids"

If you, like most on reddit do, live in a 1st world country and still don't think it's something to worry about, you've most likely not cared (which is stupid), you're willfully ignorant (also stupid), or you've fallen for propaganda (yes, also stupid).

So if you're (really) worried about climate change, congrats, you're one of the smart apes on this primitive dirtball inhabited by psychotic apes. It doesn't count for much as we don't really have any power and we're apparently in a minority.

I'm trying to reduce my carbon footprint and become more environmentally friendly and green etc. 

One thing I'm struggling with is flying. Obviously one should not fly at all if possible, but sometimes I don't have much choice.

I've been looking into carbon offsetting, and tried a few carbon calculators, however the results vary hugely.

For example, with one calculator it would cost almost 100 euro, but another it's around 20 and the next it's less than ten.

I checked with the airline official calculator and it was 4 euro or so. 

I'm just so confused. I don't want to pay any less than what I need to but I also don't want to spend hundreds if it's not necessary, I don't have unlimited amounts of money haha

So I'm not really sure what to do.

I was considering just averaging a few calculators and doing that amount? I don't know. Does anyone have any advice? (apart from not flying at all in the first place)

Thanks anyways!Question about carbon offsetting?"

0,"Hi Reddit, I have recently launched a competition and a website ([Athenum.io](https://athenum.io/) ) to understand how restaurants can be more sustainable for the environment and support local economies. And when I say restaurants it is in the broadest sense, including cafes and takeaways too.

As a company we want to evaluate businesses by how sustainable they are to the environment using data, and we are starting with restaurants as that includes complex supply chain that can be hard to see as a customer. I believe that simply changing the individual habits will not be enough to solve the pollution and climate change issues, but the businesses need to be accountable and do their part as well. Creating incentives for the businesses to adopt sustainable practices could help more than just shaming them. And I am sure that many people would care about having lower impact on climate and chose to purchase sustainable services and goods especially if that doesn't compromise the quality of experience.

I am interested to know what do you think about this and if you would like to hear more. Also would you use such information to decide where to go? If you are already running a sustainable restaurant, what are you currently doing to promote it?Would you be interested to know which restaurants around you are environmentally sustainable?"

0,"I work as a plastic pollution activist having worked for large public and private organizations internationally tackling the plastic pollution issue. Companies are freaking out about this problem due to consumer and media push back about all of the non recyclable plastics they are constantly pumping out and which we (for the most part) have no choice in participating in everyday resulting in a scary cost to our environment. 
Consumers have had it and have made it known that we want to see these corporations make changes. Ive worked with these companies and some of them do care and want to change most think the solution is to make bold claims that they are going to reduce plastics in their packaging or make their products 100% recyclable by 2025 or divert all their wast from landfill, etc. (you catch my drift) without understanding the implications of these statements. 
This is the thing, they don’t realize (I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt) that this is not possible at the moment in our current landscape. Recycling is about profit and currently there is no market for non recyclable materials and because the majority of products created today aren’t curbside recyclable and the ones that are have a high contamination rate, the amount of recyclable material for purchase is pretty small. Therefore, it can’t be scaled for use in 5 years like all of these large corporations like Unilever, Nestle, PepsiCo, P&amp;G, etc. are excitably claiming. 
SO what is going to happen is 2025 is going to come around and people are going to realize these companies have made no true progress and their commitments were all just a marketing ploy. 
My point in all of this is to say, to make REAL change companies have to commit to using less complex material components (I’m talking mono layered plastics) and there has to be a HUGE investment in recycling by our government and the private sector. Right now most plastics used are in flexible packaging that has ZERO value. The value of that material does not offset the cost of collecting and recycling it so the only way it can be recycled is by having a brand pay a premium for it to be recycled, So companies need to invest in simpler materials that can be curb side recyclable. 
Remember folks anything, and i mean ANYTHING, can be recycled, it just boils down to economics and what the value of that material is.PSA: Companies will not meet goals to go plastic free or use all recycled plastics by 2025"

If You Want ‘Renewable Energy,’ Get Ready to Dig
Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of plastic.
By Mark P. Mills
Democrats dream of powering society entirely with wind and solar farms combined with massive batteries. Realizing this dream would require the biggest expansion in mining the world has seen and would produce huge quantities of waste.“Renewable energy” is a misnomer. Wind and solar machines and batteries are built from nonrenewable materials. And they wear out. Old equipment must be decommissioned, generating millions of tons of waste. The International Renewable Energy Agency calculates that solar goals for 2050 consistent with the Paris Accords will result in old-panel disposal constituting more than double the tonnage of all today’s global plastic waste. Consider some other sobering numbers:A single electric-car battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Fabricating one requires digging up, moving and processing more than 500,000 pounds of raw materials somewhere on the planet. The alternative? Use gasoline and extract one- tenth as much total tonnage to deliver the same number of vehicle-miles over the battery’s seven-year life.
When electricity comes from wind or solar machines, every unit of energy produced, or mile traveled, requires far more materials and land than fossil fuels.

 every unit of energy produced, or mile traveled, requires far more materials and land than fossil fuels. That physical reality is literally visible: A wind or solar farm stretching to the horizon can be replaced by a handful of gas-fired turbines, each no bigger than a tractor-trailer.
Building one wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel, 2,500 tons of concrete and 45 tons of nonrecyclable plastic. Solar power requires even more cement, steel and glass—not to mention other metals. Global silver and indium mining will jump 250% and 1,200% respectively over the next couple of decades to provide the materials necessary to build the number of solar panels, the International Energy Agency forecasts. World demand for rare-earth elements—which aren’t rare but are rarely mined in America—will rise 300% to 1,000% by 2050 to meet the Paris green goals. If electric vehicles replace conventional cars, demand for cobalt and lithium, will rise more than 20-fold. That doesn’t count batteries to back up wind and solar grids.
Last year a Dutch government-sponsored study concluded that the Netherlands’ green ambitions alone would consume a major share of global minerals. “Exponential growth in [global] renewable energy production capacity is not possible with present-day technologies and annual metal production,” it concluded.
The demand for minerals likely won’t be met by mines in Europe or the U.S. Instead, much of the mining will take place in nations with oppressive labor practices. The Democratic Republic of the Congo produces 70% of the world’s raw cobalt, and China controls 90% of cobalt refining. The Sydney-based Institute for a Sustainable Future cautions that a global “gold” rush for minerals could take miners into “some remote wilderness areas [that] have maintained high biodiversity because they haven’t yet been disturbed.”
What’s more, mining and fabrication require the consumption of hydrocarbons. Building enough wind turbines to supply half the world’s electricity would require nearly two billion tons of coal to produce the concrete and steel, along with two billion barrels of oil to make the composite blades. More than 90% of the world’s solar panels are built in Asia on coal-heavy electric grids.
Engineers joke about discovering “unobtanium,” a magical energy-producing element that appears out of

 nowhere, requires no land, weighs nothing, and emits nothing. Absent the realization of that impossible dream, hydrocarbons remain a far better alternative than today’s green dreams.

---
Human-induced climate change is an existential risk to human civilisation: an adverse outcome that will either annihilate intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential, unless carbon emissions are rapidly reduced.

Special precautions that go well beyond conventional risk management practice are required if the increased likelihood of very large climate impacts — known as “fat tails” — are to be adequately dealt with. The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact, events would be devastating for human societies.

The bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks, and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach. 

Climate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend toward reticence and caution, erring on the side of “least drama”, and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes. Whilst this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower-probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely. 

This is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points — passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system — such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels), and permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge. 

However the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent, justify strong precautionary management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible,  contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change. 

If climate policymaking is to be soundly based, a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is now urgently required. This must be taken up not just in the work of the IPCC, but also in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge. 

**Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required.**

0,"So we have been trying to to decrease our carbon emissions and have made great steps. All of our electricity comes from renewables (NY is deregulated so we get to pick), I drive an EV (Tesla for the win!) and we work hard to keep our footprint down.

The issue is home heating. Right now we're standard heating oil. We have no NG avaliable (yes still fossil fuel but more efficient), we can't put in solar heating due to roof (cape with lots of dormers) trees and mountain, and it's all rock around us so geothermal is way too expensive (also we have baseboard hot water and no local geothermal company will work with that). I was looking I to biofuel for this coming winter but the new report from the UN still lists it as having pretty big impacts. Also I can't find anyone to deliver B20 in my area.

I want to get off of heating oil but can't seem to find an option that doesn't cost me 20 to 30k to do.

Academia is in shambles. It's not human knowledge that doubles every year, it's human fraud. Rich kids get the cheat notes and tutors, poor kids get free massive debt and few job prospects.

Many renowned scientists say the chemical industry was humanity's greatest mistake, and now life on earth pays the price. We've screwed up the biosphere so bad it's reached an ecosphere extinction tipping point, which is a technical term for everything we touch is poison.

Monsanto is like 100 years old. It probably started with mustard gas in WWI. It's a bunch of chemists making poison. You can see a history of the Rockefellers and education on the Corbett Report on YT. Corbett is terrible on climate, but good on history presentations.

&gt;Critics Say Monsanto's Spying and Intimidation Operation Show Why BioTech Giant 'Needs To Be Destroyed Now':New documents reveal Monsanto's 'fusion center' aimed at targeting and discrediting journalists and critics

https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/08/08/critics-say-monsantos-spying-and-intimidation-operation-show-why-biotech-giant-needs

100 years ago, after the oil banker barons took over public credit, they took over public education and healthcare and corrupted them completely. Nuclear power was corrupted at least 60 years ago. The Rockefellers and Carnegies were the robber barons who started it with eugenics research and public libraries way back when books were a thing. Academics don't like to discuss academic fraud, so they call it a conspiracy. How much more proof do you need that we are destined to collapse if we don't disabuse the pigs proles and plebes of greed.

Nuclear power could have saved earth from us, instead all we got are depleted uranium bullets everywhere. We don't have time for inclusive points of privilege. We gotta do something that's real. We gotta stop believing in trips to Mars, transhumanism, 5G etc or earth dies.

There are 10,000 studies that say wifi and cell radiation harm life, yet we are putting 5G stations every 300 feet in cities. It's harming birds and bees. You don't need to be a scientist to know this, but you'll be labelled a conspiracist. To all my knowledge, this stuff is true.

Academics and scientists hate what I'm about to present to you. Here's a list of scientific and academic fraud. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/

The reason for scientific and academic fraud is greed. The world is run by greedy pigs, plebes and proles. We have to tax the rich with a 100% private carbon tax that's paid 100% back to the lower 40% worldwide. James Hansen knows how to do this.

I like listening to Chomsky, he's smart and lulls me to sleep, but he's like 80 years old, and talking about ancient history. The revolution's been coming for 100 years.

“She spreads her wings and laughs at the horse”, penned over 4000 years ago regarding the ostrich running into open spaces faster than an equestrian. Sadly, the Arabian ostrich went extinct in 1973. What else occurred in that year pertaining to animals, and what possibly hindered many creatures? The U.S. under Nixon compiled a list and created the Endangered Species Act in 1973 (which excluded animals used for space exploration). Unfortunately for our environment the dollar dropped in value significantly, experiencing an inflation rate of 3.93%. A space station was launched and sadly dogs were killed, in addition to cats, mice, fruit flies, monkeys, turtles and rabbits. Has anyone researched the study of space exploration and the impact on the environment and its biodiversity? The Yom Kippur war was fought and this resulted in the rising gas prices especially in the U.S. What happened in 1973 was compacted by the declaration of peace in 1975. What happens when people feel peace is upon us? They become more complacent, relaxed, they let their hands rest at resolving major global issues like healing the environment. I am looking for a list of species added to the Endangered Species list in 1974 and there apparently are ZERO that were added that year. In conclusion, I am saddened, yet, not surprised that when there was a start to something wonderful it got thwarted the very next year. “‘There is peace! There is peace!’ when there is no peace.” Jeremiah wrote.  What are the odds that whenever we declare peace we have none? It appears that this verse is most true, in this, people, governments, and religious entities declare solutions to harmful conditions and we find ourselves smothered in failure and disappointment that can compress our bosom like a pulmonary embolism. The bright side is this, people continue to try despite these setbacks and disappointments and God does promise to bring about a global renovation soon.Peace, Be Still"

0,"So Katy Perry flew to Sicily to tackle climate change. I feel safer already. Leonardo Dicaprio, who was involved with the Malaysian oil corruption scandal, is going too. For a guy who sank on the Titanic, he sure likes his yachts.

These people are not virtuous because they're rich, in fact, it's quite the opposite. Adulation of them is exactly what's wrong with our society. How many homes, planes, yachts and cars does one person need?

Oil and gas are their primary sources of wealth. The latest gold rush is data, and this elite climate camp is sponsored by Google. Yet if IT were a country, they would be the 3rd largest emitter in the world. How many IOT devices do we actually need? Answer: none. Do we really need ""smart diapers""?

If Bernie Sanders became president and raised taxes on billionaires (which I doubt he'd actually do), how many of those same billionaires would be in line, with their hands out, trying to get rich ""fighting"" climate change? Answer: All of them. Do you remember Elon Musk's Solyndra solar panel fiasco? What good are falling solar panel prices if they won't actually solve anything?

The reason that ""progressive"" billionaires promote carbon taxes is because they can afford them, plus they'll be positioned to make even more money off of the tax handouts. Even the idea that billionaires promote socialism should give you reason to pause.

When president Marchon of France raised fuel taxes on everyone ( to fight climate change ), he cut taxes for billionaires at the same time. You can't fight climate change on the backs of the poor. That's how we got the Yellow Vest riots.

If you're a low-income earner ( the bottom 40% ) would you pay more taxes to fight climate change? If you said, yes, then you're more noble than 99% of us. But why not get paid to fight climate change? Especially if you're poor.

James Hansen proposed such a thing 10 years ago. If taxes on the rich were 100% private, and paid 100% back to the poor, we could slay 2 birds with 1 stone. A 100% private carbon wealth tax means that NGOs, corporations and governments would get 0%. 

Both socialists and capitalists hate this idea. When James Hansen first proposed this idea, Bernie Sanders sponsored a law that would allow the federal government to steal 40% of any such private tax, way back in 2011.

I am very aware of how unpopular this idea is. I do not understand it, but I'm very aware of it. It is this awareness that leads me to conclude that no one is serious about fighting climate change, which leads me to conclude we're totally doomed.

Am I claiming that 100% private carbon wealth taxes will save the world? No, I only promise it will stop profligate consumption and help the bottom 40%. I know in my heart of hearts it will never happen, but it's the little things that keep me alive, no matter how irrational.

""Some of us grew bored with mainstream media in college. We graduated to trade publications, academic journals and individual research.

Let me give you an example of what I am talking about. You put some jab out there about climate change. Do you know who I trust when it comes to climate change? I trust people who have hundreds of billions of dollars on the line in relation to climate change. I don't trust NGO partisans, environmental do-gooders, or scientists that work in a university lab. I trust people who have an enormous economic stake in the climate change game.

Insurance and reinsurance companies risk billions of dollars every year on climatic events. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year on the best scientists, meteorologists and technology, all in an effort to predict climate change. If they make mistakes, it costs the re/insurance companies, their executives and their shareholders billions of dollars.

These insurance people indicate that, according to their findings, there is no clear link yet between extreme weather patterns of late and climate change. They do not doubt that we are having an effect on the environment. That is indisputable. But people who risk billions of dollars every year are uncertain about the link between recent changes in weather patterns and climate change. The earth's climate has always changed - the conclusion that such changes are directly correlated to our society's activities are specious.

These people have no ax to grind, they have no dog in the fight. They are indifferent whether there is a link or not. They insure energy production and renewable energy production. They win either way. They are an excellent source of impartial information on this emotional topic which most people, such as yourself, simply follow like sheep, based on mainstream media.""

A hazardous waste recycling company proposed that they build their plant down wind of our city. Some of our city council thinks its a good idea because ""economic growth."" The plant would only provide 90 jobs at most.

I'm all for jobs coming to town but not at the cost of our health. This plant wouldn't be in the middle of nowhere its right next to where people live. The waste could easily be blown into the city of Muncie. Our hospital and Ball state university are only about 2.5 miles away from the proposed site.

Not a lot of people knew this was in the works in town. We are trying to get people to the next town meeting. I'm not sure how bad this could be in the next 10 years if this goes through.

One of the council said they are trusing the Indiana department of environmental management to make the right decision regarding the issue. However, the IDEM have the same strict rules like other states.

Our governments have largely failed to act because they are tied up financially and politically with these companies.

Here's some simple steps to get started (anything small helps!):

1. Boycott: look more deeply into the top 10 or 20 corporate polluters and stop buying their products.  This will take work -- it's hard to find out where they are invested and what smaller companies are their subsidaries, but this information is out there.  Googling the name of the company and then subsidiaries is a great start.
2. Divest: Campaign and protest to urge banks, municipalities, pension funds and universities to withdraw investments from the top polluters.  (this is by far the most effective way to get their attention)
3. Sanction: Campaign to pressure your government to regulate these corporations.  VOTE for candidates/parties that have a strong climate policy

We cannot wait any longer.It's time to start a boycott, divest, sanction movement for climate action. 100 companies produce more than 70% of global carbon emissions."

0,"Ok this is easily the longest thing I've ever written in my short time on Reddit. No edits, just a brain-dump of thoughts. Happy to reconsider / revise with constructive input.

Here in the US, at least, I feel like we've done a fairly good job in recent years with effectively shaming away socially unacceptable behavior: ""gay"" can no longer be used as a synonym for ""lame"" or ""uncool,"" while ""body shaming"" is actually recognized as a thing. Racial/sexual/etc prejudices, while decidedly still sadly commonplace, are at least called out and reprimanded with far greater frequency -- and amplitude! -- if only thanks to the reach of social media: people absolutely need to think twice before they talk or share material on their social accounts, or they literally risk losing their jobs, and a permanently tarnished reputation in the public eye.

So while we obviously still have a long way to go to a truly civil, equal society, these seem to be steps in the right direction. And so my suggestion is that we start to do the same thing with decidedly anti-science rhetoric, too. Simply put, when people/journalists/news outlets make anti-science claims about, say, climate change, they need to be vehemently called out on it and publicly shamed for the world to see. When people/journalists/news outlets perpetuate flat earth / moon landing / anti-vax garbage, they need to be mercilessly reprimanded in the public eye.

Simply put: If a simple comment can get somebody fired from their job because it's now deemed offensive/racist/sexist/etc, then somebody should be fired from their job for perpetuating false/fake/anti-science.

The purpose of this is two-fold:

(1) We have a civic duty to upholding the integrity of science inasmuch as we have a civic duty to upholding the integrity of society's well-being; and

(2) To ensure that non-scientists (i.e., laypersons) can have no further influence whatever on science-based law/policy/etc. (Stated rather differently, science must drive policy; not the other way around.)

If it sounds like I'm suggesting something a bit drastic, a bit draconian, yes, I am: I think that it should effectively be ILLEGAL -- or at least invalidated or socially unacceptable -- for non-scientists to have any direct influence on matters of law/policy that require, or are otherwise dependent upon, rigorous scientific study.

In simpler terms: Unless somebody is a scientist, then they should have no right to influence matters of science or policy dependent on science; meanwhile, those who interfere with, disparage, or otherwise impede science, or help to perpetuate the dissemination of anti-science rhetoric, should lose their jobs and risk potential legal action for interfering with a scientific matter as readily as they would for socially unacceptable conduct.

Crazy? Maybe... but then, nobody thought saying ""dude, that's so gay!"" was offensive even just 10-20 years ago (depending where you lived). It was a pretty common phrase even at my high school in the super-liberal SF Bay Area. But say that at your workplace today, and you will indeed likely lose your job. As you should.

The state of our environmental crisis to too severe to tolerate anything less than an absolute eradication of such complete and utter scientifically illiterate poppycock which at best will hinder the drastic measures needed for our world's survival, and at worst, condemn us to a world crumbling under the stresses of mass population displacements; climate catastrophes from biblical flooding to decades-long droughts and excessive heatwaves; species eradication; crop failure; crime; and, likely, an eventual military state where countries resort to martial law to keep what modicum of society can be maintained.

Just as wearing a seatbelt in a car was once ""uncool,"" today it's just plain brain-dead stupid not to wear seatbelt. Similarly, what was once the realm of ""tree hugging hippy"" mentality to ""save the earth, man,"" is now an indisputable, decidedly real thing already affecting us today, and it must be dealt with accordingly.

Thoughts?Hear me out: Anti-science rhetoric needs to be publicly shamed the way socially unacceptable behavior is now shamed"

I am watching in real time a widely-applauded expansion of the green-line light-rail, which I always believed would be a disaster, a money-pit, and would help no one.

0,"[https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/](https://observer.com/2019/07/climate-change-republicans-conservative-solution/)

It is imperative that we speak with conservative and independent voters about just how dangerous climate change is, because the evidence is becoming less and less deniable and the politicians attempting to deny it can no longer use the same arguments they did years ago. Their greedy motives are becoming increasingly obvious to the conservative voters that were once loyal to them. We need to take advantage of this!

What we need to realize is most republicans that didn't believe that climate change was real in the past 50 years held that belief because the media and politicians they listen to hid and still hide the truth for them. Now climate change is becoming increasingly undeniable with the overwhelming visual evidence. We need to approach conservative voters and give them the grim truth about climate change. Tell them their children's future is in danger if they keep voting for these climate change deniers. Tell them that the politicians know that climate change is real, they just pretend it's not a problem because they're just greedy old men. Climate change is an issue that has the power to break many conservatives loyalty in the politicians and media they once listened to. Even if you don\]t convince them to vote for someone who will take action, you may break their faith in politics enough that they don't vote at all, which still takes away a vote from conservatives.

More importantly think of it this way, if only 5% of the 64% of those republicans care enough to take action, that 5% could be very important in convincing the other 59% to take action.

For example think of a mostly republican neighborhood, it's sort of an echo chamber where the same opinions are held throughout the community. You're friends with one of those neighbors, you respectfully debate with them about climate change and you win him over by talking about his clild's future if we don't take action. Without ever entering this conservative neighborhood, your words created an advocate for climate change in a place where nobody cared about it. The man you talked to has the respect of the rest of the neighborhood, therefore they can spread the news about climate change in a neighborhood that once refused to even talk about the environment because they thought it was a ""liberal only"" issue. This neighborhood was once 100% conservative and didn't believe in climate change at all. Your friend managed to convince many of his neighbors that climate change was at least real. Before he talked to the neighborhood 90% of them were ready to go out and vote for trump and other climate denying politicians, but now only 50% are passionate, 25% are indifferent and 25% no longer have faith in them.

This example was simply a hypothetical. Obviously not every person we convince will be this effective at convincing others, but that being said there is also the chance you can convince somebody that climate change is important and that person becomes an extremely active advocate for the cause.

TLDR ;

This is a topic that I will continue to talk about to my fellow climate activists throughout the 2020 elections because I feel that many of us tend to ignore our conservative neighbors. When advocating for climate change action, it is imperative that we do not limit our discourse to just fellow progressives and environmentalists. Conservative voters are becoming increasingly aware that climate change isn't fake. We can use this fact to our advantage in taking down the climate denying politicians who are losing their influence due to the evidence of climate change!

Use Trump and other climate denying politician's policies against them when talking to republicans voters about climate change. Tell them that their clildren's futures are in peril due to the denial and inaction of the politicians they once were loyal to. Tell them that they never intended to make america great again, they just wanted to kill it and milk it for all it's worth. Trump doesn't care about you, he only cares about himself. Tell them that his charismatic rhetoric was only to win them over, and that it's not too late to reverse the damage he's done.

Together is how we should take Trump and other climate denying politicians down. Divided is how they win.Climate change denying politicians are losing power, lets pull their supporters away from them!"

[San Francisco International Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_International_Airport) is  going to ban the use of single use plastic bottles starting from August 20, 2019.  This is being considered an unprecedented move. 

This new rule will apply to airport restaurants, cafes and vending machines. Travelers would be expected to get their own bottles for drinking plain water or buy refillable aluminum or glass bottles from the airport.  
As a department of San Francisco’s municipal government, the airport is following an ordinance approved in 2014 banning the sale of plastic water bottles on city-owned property.

Airport Spokesman Doug Yakel is hoping vendors will adhere to the move and that penalty would not need to be levied on them. However, it is worth noting that approximately 4 million plastic water bottles are sold per year at the airport. 

Thank fully, SFO vendors have already been using compostable single-use foodware, including to-go containers, condiment packets, straws and utensils.

I don't mean the scientists of the world, or the big money makers; I mean the general public who have 9-5 jobs with families and children to take care of, or the students of the world who cannot afford much. Some people just cannot be bothered to research about climate change, not to say it is not important but because it's not directly effecting them just yet. 
I personally try and educate myself about climate change, but majority of the time all I keep hearing/ seeing is the effect of climate change on our planet and not a lot of, do this and do that if you want to help. There's a lot a finger pointing and not enough of ""I'll do my bit to help"". 
Above all of this, personally I would like to dig a little bit deeper and get involved. I want to demand more from companies but I don't know where to start. I know plastic is a big issue too alongside global warming, but using paper is not the most ideal situation either. How can we help and how can we demand more from bigger companies? 

We don't have enough time left in the world to convince everyone that global warming is a real issue, but at least if we can get as many people on board by taking action voluntarily/ involuntarily - I think it would be much better. 

I hope this all made sense and is the right forum to discuss. If anyone has any links that can also support your suggestions so I can read up on it a little more, I would greatly appreciate it!

Nuclear energy is a well understood(in the fission case at least) production level technology, capable of taking care of worldwide energy needs.   


Thorium reactors are ready to start testing and then scale. Which have numerous benefits, less toxic waste(with an order of magnitude shorter half life), far lower meltdown risk, and higher energy output per ton, to name a few.

To be clear, research should be accelerated in fusion should the government in the next budget, to the tune of at least NASA's budget(but raise that too). Fusion is the ultimate answer but it needs some time.   


Coal burning leaves many radioactive byproducts *unconfined* into the environment. Nuclear energy is far safer than oil.

**See The Power of Trees**

It has long been understood that trees and forests remain the best strategy humanity has for cleansing our atmosphere of the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, a key driver of global warming. Other technology like direct-air capture or CO2 separation have proven to be comparatively ineffective and far exceed the costs of just planting more trees.  


In their study titled *The Global Tree Restoration Potential*, Crowther Lab determined our planet could support 4.4 billion hectares of continuous tree coverage. With current global tree coverage sitting around 2.8 billion hectares, that means Earth could sustain 1.6 billion more hectares of forest. 

Of those 1.6 billion hectares, Crowther Lab discovered just under a billion hectares, excluding land occupied by agriculture and cities (about 1 trillion trees worth), inherently suitable for supporting reforestation efforts - that’s a land area almost the size of China.

Researchers [created a map](https://www.crowtherlab.com/maps-2/) that is the “first ever quantitative, spatially explicit map of the Earth’s tree carrying capacity.” They mapped global tree coverage (among many other metrics) and, most importantly, were able to pinpoint where planting trees would not only be feasible but the most beneficial to tackling “the problem of atmospheric carbon.”

&gt;The validity of the green growth discourse relies on the assumption of an absolute, permanent, global, large and fast enough decoupling of Gross Domestic Product from all critical environmental pressures. Problem is: there is no empirical evidence for such a decoupling having ever happened. This is the case for materials, energy, water, greenhouse gases, land, water pollutants, and biodiversity loss, for which decoupling is either only relative, and/or observed only temporarily, and/or only locally. In most cases, decoupling is relative. When absolute decoupling occurs, it is observed only during rather short periods of time, concerning only certain resources or forms of impacts, for specific locations, and with minuscule rates of mitigation.Seven reasons why ""Decoupling"" won’t happen"

Renewable energies are progressing quickly with falling costs

The share of renewable energy sources (RES, including hydropower) within the global power generation mix, which has been rising quickly since the end of the 2000’s, grew by nearly 1 percentage point in 2017, to almost 25%. Wind and solar generation has gained momentum, encouraged by ambitious climate policies in the European Union, the United States, China, India, Japan and Australia, and by the dramatic fall in solar and wind development costs over recent years, enabling developing countries to expand their renewable capacities. Solar was responsible of 20% of the additional power generation in 2017 and wind 30%. Renewables now cover 1/3 of the power mix in Europe, 1/4 in China and 1/6 in the United States, India and Japan.

In the European Union, the share of renewables remained stable in 2017, as the strong increase in renewable generation in Germany and the UK was offset by adverse hydraulic conditions in southern Europe (France, Italy, Spain).

I'm an Alaskan who lives on the Kenai Peninsula, an area popular for salmon and halibut fishing. I absolutely love it here and have chosen this as the place to raise my family.

As I shop for houses I can't help but wonder: ""what's going to happen here over the next 30 years?"". As far as I can tell rising water levels aren't a huge concern but the increase in water temperature and potential damage to the fisheries will be. Obviously signing a 30 year mortgage in a place where the economy is tied to a natural resource might be a risky move.

I'm wondering what this community's thoughts are around this? On one hand I think: ""if all the fish in the ocean die then we're going to have some pretty big problems in the world and Alaska is probably the place to be when that happens"". On the other hand I worry about investing in a home and literally getting stuck with a house I can't sell as the fisheries start to die and then ending up in financial ruin towards the end of my working years.

Then, a few days later, Michael Mann came out and said that our carbon budget for 1.5 C has just shrunk by 40%. But, Michael Mann will turn around and say we still have hope, nothing could be further from the truth.

Below is a chart showing how fast we must cut emissions to 0% to stay under 1.5 C. As horribly unbelievable as this chart was, it was produced in 2014, before we found out our carbon budget was shot all to hell. What this means is that we must reduce emissions at least 50% in 10 years, and 100% in 20 years. This is impossible because our energy supply has never varied from economic growth by more than 3%. We are essentially asking people to destroy the world economy. This will never happen, 100% guaranteed.

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-cliff-1.jpg?w=696

For a visual aid depicting how impossible it is, I've included a chart showing where all our energy sources come from. That little tiny green sliver at the top of the chart is renewable energy. It represents roughly 3% of total world energy use. In other words, it would have to displace the other 97% of energy use in 20 years. This cannot be done, and is literally impossible.

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/energy-sources.jpg

Our fossil emissions in 1990 were about 22 Gtons/yr, by 2000 they were about 24 Gtons/yr, by 2020 they will be about 40 Gtons/yr. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emissions2.jpg?w=696

By looking at the chart above, you can see if you are 30 years old, fossil emissions have increased nearly 100% in your lifetime. We've been pretending to fight climate change since 1990. 

Since 1990, we came up with 4 world treaties to combat climate change. Those treaties are not worth the paper they're written on. They are lies used to stall real action. If we had started real reductions in 2000, we wouldn't be facing the horrible collapse we face now.

In the last 10,000 years, humans and livestock have destroyed 98% of land vertebrate species biomass. Our green crop fields are so poisonous, they kill all birds, fish, frogs and insects that come within miles of them. There are so many poisons in the biosphere that all vertebrate species are rendered biologically emasculated, feminized and infertilized.

Mass extinction is preceding runaway hothouse chaos. Within this century our oceans will become super saturated with carbon and destroy most of the plankton on earth. In other words, earth won't be fine without us.

This next chart will vividly show you why the US and Europe do not matter anymore. What this means is that AOC, Bernie Sanders and socialist fantasies in America will have as much effect on emissions as renewable energy, which is to say none. I would like Tulsi Gabbard to be president, and Bernie Sanders to be vice president. I'm just saying while it may matter a great deal to you, it won't matter to earth. We can always make things worse than they are, but we won't make them better than they are. That time has come and gone.

0,"Reading this article about what the earth's climate might look like in a few decades if CO2 emissins go unchecked, and their model predicts it will ""resemble those of the Early Eocene, 50 million years ago, by 2150 CE"" if emissions hold current pattern.


https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/potn-pao120518.php

&gt;A study suggests that as temperatures rise future climates could be analogous to past climates from Earth's deep history. Climates from Earth's deep past may provide analogs for possible near-future climates, but past and projected future climates have not been quantitatively compared. Kevin Burke, John Williams, and colleagues compared mean summer and winter temperatures and precipitation projected for 2020-2280 CE to those from two historic and four prehistoric warm periods spanning the last 50 million years. The authors found that Mid -Pliocene climates, 3.3-3 million years ago, replaced historical precedents as the best analog for future climates after 2030 CE. Under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stabilize by the mid-21st century, Earth's projected climate stabilized at Pliocene-like conditions. Under an unmitigated emissions scenario, global climates began to resemble those of the Early Eocene, 50 million years ago, by 2150 CE. In the latter scenario, up to 9% of projected climates had no close analog among any of the past climates examined. Both Pliocene-like and Eocene-like climates emerged initially in the continental interiors and subsequently spread outward.

So what exactly was that climate like then for earth?

&gt;The heat and humidity of the early Eocene epoch made it a heavenly time for dense jungles and rainforests, which stretched almost all the way to the North and South Poles (the coast of Antarctica was lined with tropical rainforests about 50 million years ago!)

https://www.thoughtco.com/the-eocene-epoch-1091365

Basically the tropics moved north and took over entire continents. It was hot hot hot everywhere, even in the north. The thing is though we have cities where in the past these jungles took over. So instead of tropical jungles taking over, many cities (especially close to the equator) will simply become unlivable. 

I think going UP is smart, as in living above 5,000 ft or so as that will give relief from the heat and the flooding. 

Anyone with more knowledge want to jump in here go ahead.Been researching what our climate might look like within our lifetimes if emissions go unchecked (likely). Its quite fascinating and I hope other more educated people chime in here. We could be headed for an ""early eocene"" climate."

Don’t be scared to do it, you can only learn and grow. I’m sitting here typing this vegan battle and I’m alive and a proud Vegan so I dare and encourage you all to go vegan for a month and use the hashtag #Vmonth and #BeVegan. Let’s all do it for one month. This is not a post to cause drama or what not. This is just to try a vegan diet for one month... Come on guys, let’s do it. One month with a vegan diet can change your life, if you don’t know where to begin, just google or youtube about it. It is easy to find vegan food as all vegetables and fruits are naturally vegan, as are most starches. You can also get tips on how to spice and cook it the right way and you quickly see that it is amazing. The first few days might be a challenge, but just change your mindset and watch videos and tips online. Most people think soy meat is going to taste like soy sauce or something, I was there before. I was so scared and unsure to go vegan but now I feel so much better. I have more energy to do things and I’m not tired as I used to be. My body feels fresh and excited to go and do cardio. Let’s get this post trending and motivate people to try a vegan diet for just for a month. People will say no but look at the reality outside in the slaughterhouses. All of those animals are amazing living and breathing creatures but every one of them get treated like a piece of garbage. They are the same as your dog or cat, they both have kids and a life to live and they are still alive just like you and your dog so why are you mad if people abuse a dog or kill a dog if the cows you are eating tonight were brutally slaughtered. Watch videos and you will see how brutal it is out there. Animals die in pain and scream for mercy. All for our tastebuds? Hell no! GO VEGAN ONE MONTH, THAT’S IT! You might never go back to eating meat again.

Thank you for making it this far and for taking your time to read this.  Try and think twice before you eat meat, as you are supporting an innocent’s murder.

0,"Interesting: The researchers looked at the power grids in California and Texas, then modeled the ways in which energy storage might make better use of energy from renewable sources — and the ways in which storing energy from renewable sources might affect the amount of carbon dioxide the energy grid pumps into the atmosphere.

They found that in California, without energy storage, one-third of the renewable energy could be lost or never collected in the first place. And adding energy storage technologies — batteries and the like — could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90 percent.

Under the study’s models, holding energy from renewable sources also made the system much more efficient: Just 9 percent of renewable energy was lost.

In Texas, a state that generates a smaller percentage of its energy from renewable sources than California, the researchers found that adding energy storage technologies to the grid could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 57 percent. Under that model, just 0.3 percent of the renewable energy in Texas’s system would be lost.

We are a new decentralised volunteer organisation, **ANIMAL REBELLION**, based on the principles of Non-Violent Direct Action and we are planning to lead over 10k of volunteers and activists to a major action in London, UK (*in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion*) to challenge animal agriculture and fishing industry in the UK and after that other countries.

This is a one of a kind opportunity for environmentalists and animal rights activists to work together (overcoming any differences) to strongly challenge the governments to redefine the current food production system (*e.g. end animal agriculture/fishing industry subsidies, slash agricultural impact on climate change, stop oceans depletion*)

 

**WHAT?** We will go out on the streets and exercise our human right to a peaceful protest and civil disobedience (*think Suffragettes, civil rights, Gandhi*). We will demand the system change and we will educate people about veganism in the process.

**HOW?** By joining forces with about 20 animal rights organisations and also influencers and celebrities and in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion - a successful environmental movement that attracted a lot of attention to the issue of climate crisis and obliteration of biodiversity. It is acknowledged that fighting climate change and reverting biodiversity loss is impossible without changing agricultural system on the land and fishing practices on the sea.

**WHERE?** Initially in London, UK, but other countries have also expressed interest in aligning their actions!

0,"*How Green Energy and EVs Will Drive Humanity Over a Cliff*
By 2050, there will be at least 2bn cars on the world's roads. If all of those cars were EVs, annual production of neodymium and dysprosium would need to increase by 70% and stay at that level until 2050. On the same basis, annual copper output would need to increase 100%, and cobalt output would need to increase by at least 250% to meet global demand.

The increase in renewable energy infrastructure needed to provide power for EVs would also consume more metals and minerals. Wind turbines require a lot of steel, while solar panel installations consume several scarce minerals, such as high purity silicon, indium, tellurium and gallium. Extracting the minerals themselves is also a power-hungry process, adding to demand.

https://www.petroleum-economist.com/articles/midstream-downstream/power-generation/2019/ev-revolution-could-stall-due-to-mineral-shortages

Demand for copper, for example, could rise by 275 to 350% by 2050, according to academics at Yale University. The World Bank estimated in 2017 that action to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C from pre-industrial levels could mean a seven-fold increase in demand for cobalt and an 11-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2050.

https://www.ft.com/content/4863fff2-8bea-11e9-a1c1-51bf8f989972

The current EU target is to ramp up production of Electric Vehicles 200 times by 2030. But, here’s the thing – this would lead to an increased demand for production inputs of cobalt, lithium and nickel and copper to build the electrical vehicles. However at 100 times the demand world cobalt resources would be exhausted in 8 months, lithium in 5 years, nickel in 4 months and copper in 5 months.

https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-06-20/propaganda-for-renewables-a-critique-of-a-report-by-oil-change-international/

Electric cars use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. So-called smart-home systems - such as Alphabet Inc’s Nest thermostat and Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa personal assistant - will consume about 1.5 million tonnes of copper by 2030, up from 38,000 tonnes today.

Negative effects from the mining of metals like aluminum, cobalt and rare earths could impact a range of creatures from flamingoes to gorillas, plants, and even deep sea creatures.

The Future of Electronics May Depend on Deep Sea Mining for Minerals

https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/deep-sea-mining-metal-resources-advanced-technology-devel/

If, as the IEA predicts, there are 125 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030, it will require roughly 10 million tonnes of copper – a 50% increase over current annual global copper consumption (20 million tonnes).

The additional wind turbines built by 2030 would require roughly two million tonnes of copper – about 10% of the world’s current production.

That’s not even taking into account how much copper would be needed for a quadrupling of solar power, and all the enhancements to the electrical grid and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles that will be required.

Given how much aluminum, metallurgical coal, copper, aluminum, zinc and rare earths are required for each wind turbine and each EV – and how much lithium and cobalt are needed for EV batteries – it begs the question: Will the transition to a low-carbon economy lead to “peak metals” (the point of maximum metal production)?

The targets that governments are setting for themselves for electric vehicle and renewable energy adoption will require a massive increase in mining, and there’s some question as to whether the new mines required can even be built in time to meet the demand according to the timelines being set.

https://www.mining.com/global-energy-transition-powers-surge-demand-metals/

Rare earth metals are used in solar panels and wind turbines—as well as electric cars and consumer electronics. We don't recycle them, and there's not enough to meet growing demand.

0,"Living in Cardiff, I love going out to Cefn Onn Park and reminding myself of what nature feels like. When I am somewhere beautiful, I see myself attempting to absorb every detail. I try to hold in my mind that particular shape of the mountainside or the cloud formation. That way, I can carry the beauty back with me to my semi-detached suburban home. Which can be re-conjured, when the concrete jungle gets a bit much. 

It seems unimaginable to imagine the emptiness that existed before creation. Yet, so easy to ignore its daily wonders. To connect with the creation I must forget the concrete city behind me. I try and remember God formed the earth from the void which now keeps me alive. I have to remind myself that everything I eat, what I drink, the air I breathe all comes from the earth. It’s to easy to be ignorant and believe that my food, water and clothing comes from the shop. I forget seeds have been planted, crops pulled out of the ground. People then store, preserve, package and process these crops. The food is then transported to the shop and shelved for our consumption.

I love nature and forget the world is sacred and sustaining, precious and in need of protection. In fact, I use and consume it, trample over it, without taking the time to consider what impact my actions have. 

As God’s creation formed in all its meticulous glory, he ensured that it was good.

Sometimes in Cardiff, we experience bad weather, the heavy rain feels endless at times. On rare occasions, the weather can get so bad that a power-cut may be experienced, or local flooding of the River Taff. I am very grateful that I was fortunate to be born in a developed country. When these disruptions happen they tend to affect the majority for a few short hours until someone comes out to fix the problem.  

However, in less developed countries, settlements can be located on floodplains. When extreme weather strikes this can have severe consequences such as loss of life, spread of diseases and being left homeless. These people would then have to live in resettlement camps.

Its sad that circumstances of where you are born will heavily dictate the level of fortune or misfortune you will receive in life.

Because of the changing climate, flooding, droughts and unpredictable weather conditions are certain to become a regular occurrence. This will lead to more hunger, poverty, displacement and even conflict. Millions of people already living in vulnerable communities will be forced from their homes and become climate refugees. 
  
God separated out the land from the water; however, his perfect ordering of creation has been disrupted. While it can be hard to see how our everyday actions lead to such catastrophic shifts, the evidence is clear: the temperature of the earth is changing because of man-made activity. We can’t fix everything overnight, but we can start today by taking action to reduce our carbon emissions and tread lightly on the earth. 

For me food has always been plenty, and readily available. Today I look forward to finding a new recipe online and then producing the meal for my family and me to enjoy around the dining table as we listen to each other talk about their day.

In some parts of the world such as Africa where crops have failed and the food is sparse, it must be difficult for a Mother, when their children ask ’What's for Dinner?’

These settlements where crops have failed would have once had rivers flowing through them, have now dried up. 

All over Africa, the climate is changing; unpredictable weather conditions are causing havoc with harvests and leaving communities that will struggle to survive.

There are many sceptics of climate change, I don't believe it was Gods design to have oceans full of plastic, he ensured that the planet was good so that we could thrive and live a good life. The polluting of the oceans and the pumping of carbon emissions, into the atmosphere, has all been done by ourselves. However, the sceptics preach that this is natural. 

God gave us a self-sustaining planet that could provide plenty for all, we must respect the planet and work hard to keep it in healthy condition that will provide for our future generations.

Genesis 2:15 “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it.”

Revelation 11:18 “The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”

Genesis 1:26 “Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”

Proverbs 27:18 “Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored.”

Numbers 35:33“You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.”


Psalm 24:1 “A Psalm of David. The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein

God commands us to maintain and care for the earth, but God’s edict to have dominion over the earth doesn’t mean to have complete domination and exploitation of it, but sadly, this is what has happened; we continue to rape the land, denude the forests, strip-mine the hills, burn through the resources, and gut the earth. This is the sole place that we have and if we chose to abuse it, it will be a choice we will live to regret.Climate change and the bible"

THE FALL

Approximately billions of trees are cut down every year and each one of them falls with a story of a lifetime.

The tree you pass by on a daily basis has seen decades and it knows about you, your family, your history, your behaviour better than you because it has witnessed you cross by, it has seen your father and grandfather come across it. Like you hundreds of families have enjoyed its shadow, they have breath the fresh air provided by it and tastes the sweet fruit of its patience. That tree stands tall with pride of doing this well fair for us but as we all are aware of the fact that humans re not the best creature to return the favour to the environment. We hardly account for 0.1% of the total number of creatures of this globe but we account for 99% of habitat destruction.

With the fall of every tree falls a story of a seed which was nourished by nature to give its best services to all creatures who depends on it. That bud turned in to a sapling which has to grow against wind and wrath of bad weather, sometimes it had held its nerve with ragging drought and it hold us during floods. Nothing could have demolished it growth but then came us the humans who very ungratefully cut down these creatures for our survival regardless of understanding that they at first place were ensuring a pleasant habitat for us.

How does it feel to get berated when you have done something for someone and they don’t even acknowledge it and very ungratefully treat you, don’t you feel the anger of destroying their ego and teaching them how to respect if not returning the favor and that is a very basic of reacting to it hopefully trees don’t feel the same way or we all would have seen the apocalypse and we will someday with the pace we are being destructive towards the hand which provides us with our food, water and air and these three are the most important factors of survival and with one common source we hold the power to relish their production but we see otherwise. With the same approach, we will be standing on any port in the storm and nowhere to run but we humankind learn by mistakes, not by claims and being a gambit, we will allure the likes of our doom’s day.

This cries out just because one tree falls and I relate sentiments to it. No, it is because billons of such stories are falling each year and we are part of these stories. Every civilization is embarked with the cultivation they were around and we remember them for the world they left us but are we doing as good as we are supposed to do?

The primary cause of environmental decay comes from multinational corporations and companies practicing hazardous operations. Shifting the blame to the consumers is an unethical method of avoiding responsibility for the harmful actions of these companies.

While having individuals take measures such as switching to eco-friendly energy sources and reducing consumption of plastic, meats, and mass-produced items would have a positive impact, it won’t be enough. Even if every citizen of this country were to recycle, it would make a very small dent in ecological impact compared to what massive industrial monopolies are doing.

I'm currently debating someone on Facebook who posted a picture that had a dead bird next to a turbine with the caption ""If this bird was covered in oil I bet it would make headlines"" and I bottom lined him and told him that birds hitting turbines is an issue that's already being addressed by professionals and until viable solutions come up that can be applied to existing wind turbines it's kind of just a cruel byproduct. Fortunately however wind turbine designs have surfaced that are much more avian that are hopefully implemented in new construction. However from this little exchange sparked an interesting debate about the ethics of green energy with all the bird casualties. I asserted that birds will generationally become more acclimated to the existence of wind turbines and adjust their migratory paths and actively avoid wind turbines much like deer have generationally adapted to the existence of roads and consequently adjusted their habitats and routines to minimize road casualties. However since I made that assertion, based purely on speculation, I've turned up little to no evidence to support either of my assertions.

Hello all,

I (24F) am seeking advice on how to kick-start my career in the environmental sector. I have an international bachelor's degree in political science and a masters in political sociology. I would like to dedicate my career to the transition towards a more environmentally friendly society. Currently based in Paris, I'm struggling to get a graduate job because of how the system works here. France offers a wealth of super specialised and varied courses preparing you for specific careers. I'm struggling to enter the French market because I studied abroad and have a more unusual background than other applicants. My dream is to move to the south of France but jobs are more scarce so that project may have to be put on hold for a while. I'm open to moving abroad and will consider any opportunity.

I've been looking for a graduate job for over a year now (I've been working a temp job in the meantime), and realise that perhaps the problem is coming from me not knowing *what* type of positions I should apply to. I lack the scientific background to work on the technical aspects, but have many other qualities. I best see myself working in advocacy but do not know *where* to apply, despite countless hours of researching and dozens and dozens of applications. I am a good writer, have strong administrative skills and am a hard-worker who genuinely cares about our planet. I'm literally open to any position that is intellectually stimulating and will help me evolve in the environmental sector be it in sustainable energies, conservation, corporate social responsibility , waste management etc.

I would love to hear anyone's experience and how they got their foot in the door and any advice you have to give!

Have a lovely Monday,

The oceans are acidifying 10X faster than in all earth's history, and when they reach a ""critical threshold"", ocean acidification will explode 100X faster than now, killing all sea shell creatures in its wake. These micro-shelled creatures form the basis for food on earth. Life on land depends on life in the ocean. Ocean acidification makes it harder for phytoplankton to absorb nutrients. We need phytoplankton to breathe.

Micro-plastics in the ocean are killing the plankton that produce 10% of earth's oxygen.

https://futurism.com/the-byte/plastic-killing-bacteria-oxygen

And that's just the oceans. On land we have destroyed 98% of the mega-fauna on earth and replaced them with cows. There are 25 billion chickens on earth.

Germany's green energy miracle is so completely fraudulent as to defy description. Here's just one example: They burn over 60% of their recycling refuse. They like about car emissions. Their forests are dying, and they're moving whole villages to get at some the dirtiest coal in the world.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/germany-recycling-reality_n_5d30fccbe4b004b6adad52f8

The Insurance Journal recently said we have to cut emissions 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 3° C by 2100. Claire Fyson of Climate Analytics says the same thing. Stefan Rahmstorf says we have to cut emissions 100% in 20 years to avoid 2° C.

Here's the problem, 2° C on earth is the equivalent of the critical threshold danger for our oceans. Hitting 2° C will trigger five major feedbacks, which will trigger 8 other major feedbacks, leading to runaway mass extinction and runaway hothouse climate catastrophe. 

Here's the really, really bad news: even if we managed to increase our carbon budget 50%, we would only gain 10 years to cut emissions. But there's a flip side to this because arctic methane emissions are not modelled, and will likely cut our carbon budget by up to 50%, meaning we will have 10 years less to cut emissions. Arctic methane from sub-sea clathrate and tundra thermaklasts will combine with unreported human methane emissions and sink the boat

But it gets worse still, because we are slamming headlong into runaway mass extinction *ahead* of runaway hothouse climate change. Both runaway hothouse earth and runaway mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once they tip past that critical threshold. There's no guarantee earth will recover. But it gets worse.

We have to cut emissions 50% in 10 years to save the planet, otherwise ocean acidification will go into overdrive and reach mass extinction escape velocity, but China will not even begin to **significantly** reduce emissions until 2030 at the earliest. But it gets worse. Emissions have to go down **significantly** now, not 10 years from now. China has recently cut solar production 40%.

To stay below 1.5 C we have to cut emissions 100% by 2050.

To stay below 1.5 C we can only emit 420 gtons C02 total.

Even if we managed to change the 420 gton budget by 50% up, or by 50% down, we only get 10 years more, or 10 years less time to cut emissions 100%.

If methane emissions increase enough to  shrink our carbon budget to 220 gtons, then we have to cut emissions 100% by 2040 they say.

Mass extinction not included.

I think this means if we don't cut emissions 50% in 10 years, we'll never make it. Emissions will go up between 10-15% in the next 10 years.

If you are 15 years old, emissions went up 30% in your lifetime. 

If you are 30 years old, emissions went up 60% in your lifetime. 

After 30 years trying, solar and wind are &lt; 3% of total world energy use.

&amp;#x200B;

But we don't have all of humanity's resources behind it, and there's a good reason. The reason is fascism. As Madeline Albright describes in ""Fascism: A Warning,"" fascism thrives in an environment of uncertainty and fear.  She writes that, for example, in the early days of Hitler's rise to power, when he was the head of the Nazi political party but not yet in government, as the German economy improved, the fascist party lost support, and when the German economy then started to veer back into depression, the fascists gained power. Fascism thrives when there is fear and uncertainty, because that is when people are most open to a strong leader with simple answers who defines enemies who can be made to be the fault of all hardship. When times are tough, fascists gain support.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, there is no better environment for fear and uncertainty than global warming. It's going to cause increasing amounts of disruption, death, and destruction everywhere: the perfect environment for a fascist. If you're a fascist, you want to help this along, not bring it to a close.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the state of play, then, as I see it: the fascists are in power, and unless we stop global warming, it will only get worse, which makes an environment better for fascists. The fascists don't need to do anything to make global warming worse, they just need to run down the clock.  When the effects of global warming become obvious, instead of ignorable as they are today, the fascists have a new threat to rally their troops against: Look at what the immigrants or leftists or elites or gays or whatever are doing to us now, they can yell, and solidify support as it gets worse.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's it. Checkmate. They win, we lose. All that's left is to tip over the king, say ""good game,"" shake hands, and fold up the board. We're not going to survive this. We can play it out if you want, but humanity's not going to win.Wow, it's a real scorcher out there!"

Hoping to call attention to the subject of today's Public Utility Commission hearing, members of Extinction Rebellion Central VT early this morning blocked a State Street intersection (at Taylor Street/Governor Davis Avenue) as part of their efforts to get the PUC to reject a petition by Noverco Inc. to acquire a controlling interest in Vermont Gas Systems, Green Mountain Power Corporation, and subsidiaries of Green Mountain Power Corporation. 

**A multi-layered corporate structure is at the heart of the issue.**

Noverco, Inc., which operates as an oil producer based in Montreal, indirectly owns 71% of Énergir, L.P. , the main distributor of natural gas in Québec. 

Énergir, L.P. is involved in developing renewable, liquefied and compressed natural gas, solar and wind power and hydroelectricity. Formerly known as Gaz Métro and a diversified energy company, Énergir, L.P. also, through its subsidiaries, operates in nearly fifteen states, where it produces electricity from hydraulic, wind and solar sources. It's also the leading electricity distributor and sole natural gas distributor in Vermont. In 1986, Gaz Métro acquired Vermont Gas Systems, which distributes all the natural gas in Vermont, and, in 2007, it acquired Green Mountain Power, which distributes 70% of the electricity in Vermont.

A complex restructuring in 2010 resulted in Énergir, L.P capital being held primarily by Noverco, a private company controlled in part by investment firm Trencap, public pipeline company Enbridge, and the public energy company Valener.

**Activists reject the idea of a pipeline company having greater ownership in local utility companies.**

The ""regenerative culture"" activists want the PUC to ""reject the petition to buy out the public shareholders in Énergir, increasing Enbridge's ownership stake in in VGS and GMP to nearly 40 percent."" They hope to ensure Vermont remains less reliant upon fossil fuel and note that Enbridge is being sued by the Michigan attorney general, who called its dual oil pipelines in the Great Lakes an ""unacceptable risk.""Activists Block Montpelier Intersection in Show Against Enbridge"

Hi everyone.

I'm a bit nervous to post to such a huge audience.

*Why bamboo?* Bamboo grows faster, can **absorb more carbon, create more oxygen, and yield more hardwood** than an equivalent stand of trees *within 10 years*. And you don't have to kill it when you harvest it, so it's great against soil erosion. 

Grow more trees and leave them be, but as a lot of you know, we  don't have the time to wait 40-70 years for them to mature. We can grow bamboo quickly and to replace construction materials, plastics, fabrics, charcoal and more in less time and **without the damage of deforestation**.

*Why an app?* I recognise that a lot of people want to make a change but just don't know what to do, or feel they don't have time. So I thought about how I could turn an easy everyday action (how many times do you open a new tab every day?) into a powerful tool to do good. *I know ads suck*, but not compared to 4-6º degrees of warming, right?

It's read to [add to Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bambeere-%E2%80%94-the-browser-ta/hdiiakgcahadnmkfhhbbjeaiibhocena) and I've *almost* got the Firefox version ready and working.

*How much does it cost?* 

**The app is free.**

I'm currently making working out details with sustainable ecologically-focused bamboo plantations in South America and North Africa and roughly put it's about €6,000 per ha for a 5 year managed growth that pays fair wages to local worker and within a year I want to have at least 10ha in the ground as a pilot scheme which means **€60,000/$70,000 needs to be raised fast**.

If **10,000 of us ad this extension**, in one year we will *just about* reach 10ha. If 100,000 of you do it, we'll be there even quicker.

Once the [bambeere.org](https://bambeere.org) website is finished, I will publish transparent reports about money raised and how it's spent.

How water gives meaning to life  
A thirsty thought understands the need for water, when we are born, all we know is to drink water, let the water flow through our eyes, in the form of tears. Tears are a medium to represent our life’s most exciting moments, be it joy and happiness, or love and sorrow. Starting from having a bath in a tiny tub of our size, to our luxurious showers, we haven’t learned the fact that with our current approach we will either sink in it or will die looking for it. Science may have taught us the life cycle of condensation and evaporation but didn’t teach us how to ride that cycle, how to have a piggy bank for it and keep it in our basket. H20, is just a formula for water, for us now. Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water and all major cities are sooner or later will join the quest to doom 

  
Have you ever kissed the droplets of dew, and try not to drink it?   
It is said that one should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, to be healthy and fit. But have you ever wondered the thirst and need of our mother earth for pure water to accommodate all of its children per day? Per week and month?? And so on! We used to get punishments in school when we didn’t do our homework right? Exactly, the same situation is right now. We forget to do our homework, to water the plant, to see it grow. Where is the excitement? To water, the plant is to nourish our mother nature. In return of doing nothing, natural disasters are the punishment, not for just us, but to other innocents too on our behalf. Imagine a world, where we get an instant return for what we do. Forex. We plant a tree; we get the fruit the other day. We water a plant; it rains at the same moment. It would have been a blessing, right? So, patience is what, we are losing. Being a mother is a feeling, which everyone says only a mother can understand. But I say when you plant a tree, and water it daily, watch it grow, who will the most hurt person, to watch it die one day? The love for nature has no birth and expiry date. It's free, it’s an elixir for life. When our eyelash falls on our cheeks, the first thing we do is take it carefully on our hand, close our eyes and make a wish. And blow it in air, but have we ever thought what if our wish stays with us, and lashes got just carried away by the wind, what if the receiver never receives the message? The same way a lot of people are wishing for a healthy planet, silently and it’s our turn to open our eyes and let it happen. Imagine a home of fish, or a crocodile or a turtle, they are nearly homeless these days,   
In textbooks, we came across to “water water everywhere, nor a drop to drink”; isn’t it’s becoming true?   
Okay now let me take you back to the time when elites had the giant pools, and queens had the most luxurious bath of the time; and when their gardens were flourished, their ponds were full of fishes and many more. You might have a question now; when they never thought of saving water, then why should we?? The answer lies in the stories itself, what they took from nature, they returned it in an acceptable form to it, and what we are doing is, we want the purest form of water, use it, spoil it, make money, and never care where does that water go.

I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes numerous environmental factors and pollutants. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

0,"B the title I might come off with an excessively nihilistic vibe, but I must admit this is weighing heavily on my mind lately. I understand it is extremely difficult to change anyone’s beliefs, but time is running out and we simply cannot afford to give up. I know a good amount of my friends and family at this moment do not believe in climate change, but I will not be apathetic. We have to try. This is the most important issue we are facing on earth and we are running out of time. I’m just here to say this so if all else fails, I can rest knowing I tried. So here goes...

Everyone I know personally who believes in climate change doesn’t talk about it. Maybe we are scared. Maybe we don’t want to think 20-50 years into the future. My question is how much does it hurt you to educate others? How much have you actually researched into this topic, apart from people’s opinions that share your same viewpoints? I am guilty of this. We need to educate others, but also empathize and understand them. We need to donate to research. We need to commit to changing the entire way we consume energy and food. We need to reduce, reuse and as a last resort, recycle. Once it becomes common, it will be normal. We just have to start changing the way we live today.

Climate change can no longer be a taboo topic based on your political beliefs. We must be able to discuss this at work, at home and with friends and family. We must set the influence. Pick up after others, talk to our city officials about what can be done to help locally, but do not give up.

I am a firm believer of altruism being a powerful influence. If we can empathize with others we may be able to persuade them. We can’t expect to change minds by fighting with them. We MUST set a positive example. No more us and them. We are all humans and this will affect us all. It is only about what is most important: Our future. Generations ahead will thank us. Imagine how proud they will be when they read the history books and see how we solved certain extinction. If you have kids, do it for them. The world needs to hear our voice of concern, but it must be heard with the best intentions. And it MUST be relentless.

 Please share this or share your own thoughts. Share on your social media. I don’t care, just put it out there, guys. It doesn’t cost anything. Let others know that believing in climate change does NOT put into question whether God exists or not. It does not make anyone less of your political party to believe in this. It just means you care about this planet and every human, plant, animal and drop of water on it.

0,"Come on. In the next 10-15 years, 35% of our coral reefs will be gone. We have already lost 20% of our coral reefs, meaning within 15 years we will likely have lost half. Big deal, its only coral right?

Two thirds of the air we breathe is produced from coral reefs, more than the rainforests, and it takes hundreds of years to grow, under specific conditions. It is extremely sensitive to changes in pH and heat, which an increase in CO2 does - increases ocean acidity and temperature, meaning the ocean can absorb more CO2. It is being lost at twice the rate of the Amazon rainforest, takes longer to grow (mm a year) and produces more air.

A huge amount of marine species rely on them for life and so do many land organisms, yet they're just being destroyed. 9 of the last 10 years have been the hottest on record. Today in Britain it is expected to hit 39, hottest day on record. On average 200 species go extinct EVERY DAY, 1000x the natural rate.

Yet somehow some people still don't accept it. Vast swathes of land are being turned into more housing for more people who just waste resources and pollute even further. The air in China and India can be as bad as smoking 65 cigarettes a smoggy day and a pack a day when it's not smoggy.

50% of all sea turtles died last year, alone. A truck load of plastic ends up in the ocean every minute. Coca Cola produces 100 million tonnes of plastic every year for their bottles. That's just one company.

The goal of this project is to restore agricultural systems to improve productivity, community livelihoods, and environmental sustainability.

The tree planting was carried out in Rutsiro District, Mukura Sector, with participation from 200 volunteers. Most of the trees were Grevillea Robusta (pictured below), a species preferred by farmers in agroforestry, used in planting with food crops because it is relatively fast growing and does not compete too much with other plants for water. The other tree type was tree tomato, which is exactly what it sounds like, an edible fruit tree. 

Overall, 380 acres were newly planted with these trees, which will be well cared for over time by the farmers who manage the lands.  About 4,000 additional trees will be planted here in the spring as a final part of the project, which will add lemon and avocado trees to the mix.20K Trees Planted for Agroforestry by Women’s Coop in Rwanda"

0,"When scarce rainfall in an area and quality of soil makes it difficult to consider successful reforestation, I was wondering how expensive would be to water newly planted trees until they are mature, and beyond. I've found online numbers from 30,000 litre to a quarter of a million litre to water a tree per year, which is understandable given the variation in soils, weather conditions and the requirements of each tree variety themselves. Are these numbers a good estimate? Maybe more to the lower end hopefully?  

Thinking of arid desert landscapes near the sea, if we used water from a desalination plant, which seems to cost from half a dollar to one dollar per 1,000 litre ([see this recent blog article](https://smartwatermagazine.com/blogs/carlos-cosin/evolution-rates-desalination-part-i)), we could water a tree from $30 to $250 a year. Let's say a tree takes 25 square metres in a reforestation plan. A (rather big) desalination plant can produce 500,000 cubic metres of water per day (180M m3 a year approx.) at the prices quoted above. With these numbers we can water from 700,000 to 6 million trees, that is from 18 to 152 square kilometres of newly planted forest, that would cost to water from $21M to $1,500M a year. This seems to be quite a lot, even at the lower end of money and higher end of surface/trees, but a few number to compare with: Central Park in NYC is three and a half square kilometres, Amazon profit in 2018 ($11bn) would cover costs for 75,000 square km of forest in a favourable scenario with my numbers, that is about the whole of Belgium and The Netherlands combined, or a forest of a hundred kilometres wide from San Francisco to San Diego.

Anyone here with experience in reforestation and cost of water, etc. that would like to confirm or correct these rough numbers?How much would it cost to water a reforested mountain?"
0,Hello! My name is Lalli and I made a petition to ban single-use plastic in Chicago! It would be amazing if you guys could sign it and spread the world throughout all social medias to gain more signatures+support :) Im doing this because Greta Thunberg inspired me to fight for my future and all of humanity's. Once you click the lick it will explain more of my cause and why i support it. Thank you guys!

0," I'm building a new way to **support reforestation for free**, by watching ads - basically when you watch an ad, the ad revenue goes to a charity that plants trees. That way you can donate to charity without spending money just by giving up a few seconds to watch an ad.

Thoughts on that? Would you use it? What features might you like?Planting trees for free?"

The poster project is a place where activists and artists can share their knowledge and skills in order to create powerful, emotional and impactful posters and designs in order to raise awareness to social issues such as climate change, injustice, corruption, equality, pollution, genocide and others.

Take for example an artist makes a poster to raise awareness about climate change in his hometown. The design is amazing and has strong emotional appeal to it, so he also shares it on his social media platforms as well, but he only has about 500 followers, so it doesn't get the attention he wanted it to. Now say he posts it to the Poster Project, it is upvoted through the roof and is the hottest post on the subreddit! Fellow redditors across the country can then print out that poster and hang it up in their towns as well, thus spreading the message that the artist wanted to share far further than just his hometown!

&amp;#x200B;

Artists and designers make the posters for activists and citizens to share to their communities and in turn the activists and citizens can provide stories that can inspire even better designs from the artists. All are welcome to the poster project!

(Note the subreddit is still very new and therefore isn't very active yet. Tonight is the first time I am sharing the poster project to larger subreddits.)Introducing the Poster Project"

Omnitopia: The Global Collective

An Outline for Our Sustainable Future

&amp;#x200B;

	The current situation on our planet is not sustainable. Our social and moral foundations are eroding beneath our feet and the damage done to our environment increases daily. If we are to continue to exist without destroying ourselves, the fundamentals and values of our society must be reevaluated and reformulated from the ground up. The list provided in this document is a general framework towards achieving this end. There are only two options that the human race is currently confronted with: change or extinction. One individual alone cannot easily change our society, but enough like-minded individuals, cooperating collectively, with dedication and hard work, can achieve this goal. The time has come to look past that which divides us and see how we can draw strength from our fellows. A human race that acts as one cohesive, indivisible unit is necessary for our own survival.

The Four Sectors of the Global Collective: 

Guidelines for Collectives and Individuals

&amp;#x200B;

	In order to create a society that is the antithesis of the one we currently have, a litany of changes are necessary. The most notable of these is a fundamental reformulation of the way our social institutions behave. Today’s institutions exist to preserve themselves and the status they hold within our culture. Institutions that are static, meaning that they resist change to stay in place and maintain control, are both inefficient and counterproductive. We need a set of institutions that are dynamic as opposed to static; a set of institutions that embrace change at every moment in order to become more streamlined and efficient as they evolve. The following is a list of suggested institutions for The Global Collective. These four sectors will replace our current political, economic, and educational institutions. 

Collective Guidelines

1.  Fundamental Education and Periodic Inquiry

	a) The institution of education will be considered the most integral part of the Global Collective. Groups of 	people will 	participate in the collective pursuit of knowledge. These groups will be led, but not controlled, by individuals with 	significant experience in the specific field of study.

b) In addition to study of specific fields of interest, every individual will receive the same degree of general education. The end goal of this general education is to cultivate individuals that are well informed, critically thinking, and inquisitive. 

c) Both groups and individuals will be encouraged to ask any questions they might have. Furthermore, at periodic intervals, groups will be asked to take a step back and ask how and why everything works the way it does. These groups will also be challenged to see if they can come up with any improvements or tweaks that could more effectively streamline a procedure or process.

2.  Resource Sustainability and Future Projection

a) Availability and quantities of resources will be updated in real time so that rates of usage never exceed rates of production. These updates will be automated to the highest degree possible.

	b) Levels of efficiency will be assessed and recorded so that action may be taken if a procedure or process is unsustainable.

3.  Constructive Cooperation and Analytical Diagnostics 

	a) Groups of willing and capable individuals will address and attempt to solve any societal problems that 	may arise; these 	individuals will do so under the guidance of the scientific method so that they will remain objective throughout the process.

	b) Problems will be analyzed as they arise. The root cause of dilemmas will be diagnosed when possible.

When the root cause of a problem can be determined, the solution should come from addressing the problem at its source; as opposed to addressing the symptoms caused by the problem.

c) Groups of people will be encouraged to examine problems from different perspectives. Analysis of problems from varying perspectives will provide fresh insight into different methods of solving problems.

4. Societal Integration and Dynamic Feedback

a) Groups of people will be encouraged to participate in recreational activities. These recreational activities 	will promote both the release of stress and the strengthening of social bonds between group members.

b) Open expression of thoughts and ideas will be encouraged in any and all arenas. Upon completion of any activity; educational, constructive, or recreational, the participants will be asked to provide feedback about 	the procedure or process.

On the Maintenance of Social Equality

&amp;#x200B;

	Class differentiation has existed since the foundation of civilization, consequently, it is hard to imagine a world in which it does not exist. But, our society is rapidly transitioning out of the industrial age and into the technological age. If we are able to effectively phase into the technological age, the creation of a utopia becomes a realistic possibility. As technology continuously improves, eventually scarcity will become an outdated convention. In a world where scarcity is no longer an issue, goods are produced in enough abundance to be freely available. If goods are freely available and have no cost assigned to them, the means of class differentiation disappear. 

	In order for society to move past classism, society must also move past the definition of oneself by their material possessions. The importance our current society places on possessions is a product of consumer culture. Moving past the dependence on ownership of objects is essential to the maintenance of social equality. Admittedly, there are a lot of nice, luxurious things in the world. But, the bond a person has with an inanimate object can never come close to the comradery of life-long friendship. Real-world connections with others are what truly matters. Furthermore, a greater quality of life can be achieved by devoting one’s time to pursuing passions. This will create a greater degree of fulfillment than spending one’s life pursuing status symbols.

	The profit mechanism is the root cause of the majority of the problems our society faces today. Not only is it the source of the chasm between the upper and lower classes, but it is the cause of extensive harm to our environment. Some people would argue that competition for the sake of profit encourages innovation. But competition in the context of profit is counterproductive, because competing parties are only striving to be marginally better than their rivals. If a company were to make a significantly superior product than their competitors: then they may spend too much to produce it and not turn a profit. Furthermore, a vastly superior product that doesn’t become obsolete within a few years would put the producer out of business. Planned obsolescence goes hand in with cyclical consumption, and cyclical consumption goes hand in hand with unnecessary waste of resources. And lastly, the profit mechanism encourages harm to the environment. This is the case because practices and policies that have the least impact on the environment are often the most expensive. If a company can make more money by sacrificing the wellbeing of the environment, they will do so. The profit mechanism must not exist in a world that is to remain viable for human life.

	Many individuals find the root of their identity in their nationality. By no means is culture a crime, but at times national prejudices serve as a wedge that drives groups of people apart. Without the existence of nations, the separation of peoples into competing factions becomes more difficult, and the creation of collective cooperation at a societal level becomes more realistic.

	Religion, and the devotion to one’s personal God, is a very sensitive issue. But the fact that preference of one benevolent deity or another can oftentimes inspire deep seated hatred between groups of people, is concerning and unsettling. My hope for the future, as should be yours, is that people are able to look past their differences and put more emphasis on their similarities. By doing this, we will actually be adhering to the Golden Rule instead of deviating from it.

&amp;#x200B;

On Improving the Quality of Human Life

&amp;#x200B;

	In the Global Collective, Education will be the most fundamental part of our society. Currently, education is primarily geared towards preparing people to enter the work force. This means that all the resources and energy of educational institutions are spent grooming students to be active participants in an endless cycle of consumption. Learning solely for the sake of knowledge is a practice that is almost completely extinct in today’s world. The majority of people see knowledge or college diplomas as a means to an end; the end of having a good job and enough money to be happy. But this pursuit is a fallacy. True happiness can be found in the pursuit of knowledge and engaging in logical discourse with those around you. In the Global Collective, exchange of information and ideas is essential to the continuous improvement of our citizens.

	In the same theme of not defining oneself by their possessions, people will also not be defined by the luxury of the house in which they live. Housing situations will be both practical and pragmatic; never lavish or excessive. People will have the choice of living alone, in communes, or with family members. 

	The major emphasis of healthcare will be on prevention as opposed to reaction. A high degree of diseases and conditions that arise in today’s healthcare systems are easily preventable if there were more proactive measures in place, as well as a better mindset about health. A new healthcare system with a holistic approach to health and medicine will work best for both the providers and recipients of care. 

	Many people would argue that violence is an inescapable part of human nature, but I would have to disagree with this assertion. The only reason human civilization has progressed this far and become this advanced, is our ability to work cooperatively. There is still a lot of room for our improvement, and this improvement could be more easily accomplished if the broader societal mindset placed less emphasis on individuality and more emphasis on collectivity.

	The setting and realization of goals, as well as the expression of thoughts and ideas, are essential parts of leading a fulfilling life. Not only are these activities fulfilling, but they can be therapeutic as well. Active engagement with the people around us and the world around us will help to combat the recurring dysfunction that we see in the world today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Concluding Remarks and Hopes for Our Future

&amp;#x200B;

	Transforming our culture from one of excessive waste into one that is sustainable into the future will be a long and arduous process. But, it is a process that must be undertaken if we want to have a future to speak of. We are at a turning point as a species, and we must collectively choose either failure or success. Making sustainable living choices as an individual is a step in the right direction, but these choices can only go so far when the broader mindset is one of apathy and indifference. The beginning of this long road starts with informing the people around you that there is a better alternative to the way the world works. But this better alternative will never be realized if we cannot work together to change the status quo of our culture. As more and more people become aware of the state of dysfunction our current society is in, more and more people will have a thirst and desire for real, comprehensive change for the better. Eventually, as more people are awakened, it is possible that world governments, and not just individuals, would want to sign on to the idea of The Global Collective. When this happens, an interim federation of countries that agree with the ideals of The Global Collective can be formed. As momentum continues to grow, and a majority of countries join the federation, the realization of our goal is within sight. Once every country signs on and joins the federation, the federation will cease to exist and The Global Collective will be realized.

&amp;#x200B;

	The ideas set forth in this document are in no way intended to rob people of their individuality. They are instead a means to level the playing field from which people begin. Individuals in The Global Collective will not define themselves by the amount of money they have, the kind of car they drive or by the size of their home. Our citizens will be defined by the contributions they make to our society, by the original thoughts they share with others and by the positive effect they have on the world around them. Every person in The Global Collective will be encouraged to realize their full potential. Furthermore, within The Global Collective, dishonesty subversion and manipulation will not be seen as means toward obtaining an end. A broad shift in societal mindset is required. This can only be achieved with collective solidarity applied over the course of several decades. The end goal is the realization that your own well-being is not above and beyond the well-being of others, and that the well-being of our planet in its entirety is a necessity. You are a part of a greater whole, with a greater purpose; if the greater whole realizes its full potential, then all parts within that whole will realize their full potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

	The framework put forth in this document is far from perfect, but it is a significant step in the right direction. Eventually, this will be more than just a list of ideas on a piece of paper, it will be a way of life. The greatest requirement is the ability to act. If the propositions in this document resonate with you, I implore you to take some degree of action to help me expand this message. At the very least, take the time to discuss these ideas with a friend. To be more involved: Take pictures of this paper and share them with others or make photo copies of this paper and pass them out to others. If you desire change, do not fail to act; make the world a better place to the best of your own ability. The positivity you put out will return to you in one form or another.

&amp;#x200B;

	This document is overtly encouraging a revolution. But, such revolution can by no means be achieved through the use of violence. Violence is contrary to the ideals of The Global Collective. Any revolution involving violence would only lead to a continued repetition of past mistakes. We require a revolution to end all revolutions. We require a revolution to destroy the idea of social class. Our revolution can only be achieved through non-violent non-compliance. The best way to stop the system that is currently in place is by refusing to participate: we must collectively refuse to be a part of the endless cycle of consumption. The cycle of consumption only benefits those at the top, and we need a system that equally provides for all citizens. We will make our voices heard. Human beings are much more than cogs in a machine that exists only to reap vast profits from both the subjugation of the down-trodden and the rape of our mother earth. If all the small cogs of that machine collectively refuse to turn, the entire mechanism will come to a grinding halt. And, at this point, there is no other option. Our biosphere is rapidly approaching a level of damage from which it will be unable to rebound. It is fundamental to realize that all parts of our planet are interconnected. We all come from and return to our biosphere, and willful destruction of that biosphere is literal suicide. We, the silent majority that will no longer remain silent, choose life instead of death. We choose integrity and truth as opposed to dishonesty and subversion. We choose to invest in our future rather than to stagnate in our past. We choose to go forward hand in hand, side by side, instead of using the backs of others as stepping stones to the top. We choose an existence of substance, meaning and value as opposed to one of mediocrity, repetition and squandered potential. But, most important of all, We choose to do it together and not alone.

Planting trees is a good step, but we need to take better care of the oceans.

The ocean occupies around 72% of the Earth's surface and all of  this is available for the green oxygen producing plants, especially  phytoplankton.

**A Conspiracy To Save Earth:**

100% Private Wealth Tax = 100% Private Basic Income
---

Reddit’s collapse is just about the best link resource you can find. The downside is that they are extremely restrictive in terms of discussion. For instance, they discourage talk of collapse mitigation, and absolutely forbid gender dysphoria and child rape discussions in terms of collapse. It’s like having a shit sandwich forum, and forbidding discussion of shit.

It’s also the modern day, secular version of “holier-than-thou”. They view anybody who is not progressive — as they define it — to be evil. This means they view libertarians as Nazis. They’re a bunch of well meaning socio-fascistic dick heads — but other than that, they’re okay.

☭NN (CNN) did a hit piece on Assange. A real piece of fucking work. The Atlantic magazine says the Epstein child trafficking conspiracy is making people believe in, well… conspiracies. I remember not telling anyone, when I first put tape over my laptop. Nowadays, I wouldn’t be surprised if Google didn’t have nano-bug sniffers up my ass, eating their way to my brain from eating chocolate covered almonds.

Humans are too bio-chemically inefficient to power the Matrix. It takes more energy to keep us alive than we deliver over a lifetime. The desire to control the data in your head is a self-reinforcing, exponentiating driver of social collapse. 

In the old days, we swore oaths before death, now we click on Devilish terms of agreements. Transhumanism is a crime against god, not because of transhumanism, but because of our greedy, selfish nature.

Even our desire for justice is greedy, and selfish in nature. China has won, the socialists won, because we refuse to disincentivize them. The socialist SS war itself pays for the data war like an incestuous black and white tornado. Which is just a fancy way of saying we better tax the rich for ourselves, and only for ourselves, worldwide. 

It’s rich people ( grade 12+ ) who fly. Four billion people fly each year. That number will not go down 100% in 20 years. The sheer mass of inertial energy throughput guarantees it. You can’t stop giant oil takers on a dime. It takes them 11 miles to turn around. Socialism is too fucking slow, stupid and retarded to save a nickel.

So i've been busy trying to find a usefull measure to compare tons of CO2 to. No one knows or has a feel for how much a ton of CO2 is, and i want to make it insightful/touchable.

I've tried using trees as a comparison. But trees are just too variable, and their carbon sequestering is usually measured over years. 

I want to be able to say that someone needs to plant X trees to compensate for a certain activity, or someone just saved 100mins of showering by not eating that piece of meat.

0,"Let's spread the positivity!

Now that the year is half-way finished, we can shed some light on all the good we’ve accomplished in 2019 and get inspired for the future! Here are 20 environmental achievements worth celebrating.

# 20 Feats Worth Celebrating

**1. Thanks to Brands, Reusables Grow**

With China’s [decision](https://interestingengineering.com/china-bans-foreign-plastic-sending-recycling-industry-into-a-spin) to stop accepting foreign recyclables, many countries were left with a backlog of trash – a reminder we need to look beyond the blue bin. [TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/) founder Tom Szaky knows “the garbage problem keeps getting worse and worse.” This is why TerraCycle announced a plan making single-use plastic a thing of the past.

In the near future, you’ll be able to order household items in reusable packaging. And once you’ve had your way, the packaging will be collected from your doorstep. 

The company’s new initiative, [Loop](https://loopstore.com/), is similar to curbside pickup except the packaging won’t be broken down … just used again! Names such as Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Unilever have already jumped on board agreeing to end disposable packaging. The future is now, and it flows in one … big … loop.

**2. The EU Took a Stand Against Plastic**

In March of 2019, a pregnant whale washed up on shore with 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. Sadly, the issue of plastic in our oceans is [only getting worse](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/dead-pregnant-whale-plastic-italy/). 

A recent report from the director of the Trash Free Seas program at the Ocean Conservancy stated, “plastics are now found everywhere in the world, throughout the entire marine ecosystem and food chain, from seabirds to sea turtles to seals.” (Nick Mallos) However, the [European Union voted](https://fortune.com/2019/03/28/eu-bans-single-use-plastic-items/) to ban 10 categories of single-use plastics – from straws and cups to plates and cutlery. The ruling should be in full effect within member states by 2021.

**3. NYC Schools Went Meatless**

Meatless Mondays! Mayor Bill de Blasio [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/us/new-york-meatless-mondays-trnd/index.html) that beginning Fall 2019, New York City’s public schools will no longer be serving meat the first day of each week. The reasoning for this move is to “keep our lunch and planet green for generations to come.” (Blasio)

The fact that kids in NYC are down to munch on veggie meals once a week is pretty cool! Plant-based diets are more common among young people. And with tons of [evidence](https://grist.org/article/the-planet-wants-you-to-stop-eating-so-much-meat-and-dairy/) that meat farming plays a large role in greenhouse gas emissions, they’re taking a leap towards a greener world.

But to answer your question … no … mystery meat Mondays will not be missed.

**4. New York Banned Plastic Bags**

To top it off with a final eco-friendly ban, New York has become the second state to [ban single-use plastic bags](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/plastic-bag-ban-.html). The legislation also allows counties to opt-in to a 5-cent fee on paper bags … revenue going to the state’s Environmental Protection Fund. In a statement released in March 2019, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, “these bags have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways … \[the agreed plan will\] be a way to protect our natural resources for future generations of New Yorkers.”

**5. More Companies Turned to Regenerative Agriculture**

Reported by [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/), our soil can only handle 60 more years of traditional farming before it’s depleted. And according to Maria-Helena Semedo of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about a third of the world’s soil has already been degraded. This is why regenerative agriculture – a process which mimics how nature improves soil health and extracts carbon from the atmosphere – has become more important now than ever.

In 2019, General Mills [partnered with farmers](https://www.fooddive.com/news/general-mills-to-implement-regenerative-agriculture-on-1m-acres/549684/) to implement these practices on 1 million acres of soil. Other companies such as Hormel Foods and Danone North America have committed finances to regenerative agriculture. One company, however, has made the leap entirely. [Applegate Farms](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/applegate-bets-the-farm-on-regenerative-agriculture----launches-the-new-food-collective-300793736.html) released a new line of regeneratively made sausages “to show the world that raising animals and eating meat doesn't have to be a problem.” (John Ghingo)

**6. Polystyrene Was Left in the Dust with The Eco-Sensitive Cooler**

Polystyrene – more commonly known as Styrofoam – has been a popular material for disposable coolers … until now. It is quickly being removed from supply chains because of how toxic it is. Leading the trend, cooler company Igloo has released the[*ReCool*](https://www.igloocoolers.com/pages/recool#recool-product), the world’s first eco-sensitive cooler. Made from recycled tree pulp and paraffin wax, it is 100 percent biodegradable and can hold ice for 12 hours. It can also go five days without leaking water! After that, it can be recycled or dried out for reuse.

Although brands like Igloo have committed to reducing harmful packaging, when it comes to states, Maryland is ahead of the game! In March of 2019, the state Maryland became the [first state to ban Styrofoam](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-foam-ban-passes-20190403-story.html). What a win! 

**7.** **Burger King Goes Vegetarian**

Livestock farming contributes to 18 percent of the greenhouse gases worldwide, severely affecting climate change. Moving towards sustainability, Burger King announced its collaboration with [Impossible Foods](https://impossiblefoods.com/) to add veggie Whoppers in select stores. Dubbed the ‘Impossible Whopper,’ it’s made with plant-based materials to mimic the taste of meat … all without the pollution.

Would you like that whopper with or without beef?

**8.** **Ride-Sharing Went Green**

Topping off the push for renewable energy, earlier this year Lyft grew a green thumb. They announced an electrifying plan to invest in thousands of hybrid vehicles users can request when using “[Green Mode](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/2019/portland-green-mode).” Hand-in-hand with their initiative to make rides [carbon neutral](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/lyft-commits-to-full-carbon-neutrality-and-100-renewable-energy), this is another step to improving quality of life. A [company news release](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/2019/2/6/making-cities-more-liveable-with-electric-vehicles) stated, “replacing gasoline-powered cars with EVs is a significant step forward in our efforts to improve the quality of life in our cities.”

Humor me here! Click on your browser and search “Lyft CEO.” Is his last name a coincidence? I think not.

**9.** **All-American Blue Jeans Turn Green**

Do you want your jeans in blue or green? Turns out you can have both! Jeans have been around for so long that denim can be seen as natural. Sadly, it’s not … it’s actually [quite wasteful](https://www.ecowatch.com/environmental-cost-jeans-2544519658.html). The yarn used to make denim is pulled through boxes filled with 2,000 liters of indigo dye and water. Together, the boxes needed add up to the length of a football field. …You’d think there would be an eco-friendlier way to make one of the most popular pieces of clothing in the world.

As of June, Wrangler has broken this manufacturing tradition! Developed at Texas Tech, a new [streamlined process](https://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Wrangler-promotes-sustainability-with-new-foam-dyeing-denim-process,1015403.html#.XSi6SehKiUl) emits indigo dye via foam. Called “Indigood,” the new method eliminates over 99% of the water from the dyeing process. Not only does this remove water waste from the equation, but it decreases energy use, too.

**10.** **Airline Makes it Easy for Passengers to Reduce Their Carbon Footprint**

Air travel is a problem highly [toxic to the planet](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/1/11/18177118/airlines-climate-change-emissions-travel). Amazingly, Edelweiss airline is making it easier for passengers to reduce their carbon footprint while they explore the world. The airline has an option for flyers to fly carbon-neutral, which also adds offsets to the price of the ticket.

How does it work? When you book a flight on [flyedelweiss.com](https://www.flyedelweiss.com/DE/Pages/home.aspx), their partner [MyClimate.org](https://www.myclimate.org/) calculates the carbon emitted during your flight. They also find the dollar amount needed to offset emissions. Passengers can then add that offset amount via their ticket during the booking process. Finally, MyClimate uses the money to fund projects around the world fighting carbon emissions, deforestation, and support education of environmental protection.

**11. Puerto Rico Set Plans for a Sustainable Future**

In 2017, Hurricane Maria killed over 3,000 people and did $91.6 billion in damage. Rolling with the punches, the people in Puerto Rico are building stronger, more-resistant communities. Eighteen months after the hurricane, the island is now planning to move to [100% renewable energy](https://www.fastcompany.com/90322111/puerto-rico-just-passed-a-bill-to-require-100-renewable-electricity-by-2050). By 2050, with the help of a massive solar grid, Puerto Rico will have turned misfortune into prosperity for all.

**12. The UK Safeguarded Ocean Territory Twice the Size of England**

“The UK is already leading the rest of the world by protecting over 30% of our ocean – but we know there is more to do,” said Environment Secretary [Michael Gove](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/englands-marine-life-protected-with-blue-belt-expansion). Happily, the United Kingdom has designated a massive area of ocean territory as a marine habitat. The legislation protects 41 patches of sea – the largest expansion of the UK’s “Blue Belt” to date. This area is a collective 4,600 square miles of habitat … nearly eight times the size of London.

**13. Renewable Energy Took the Lead**

The report is in: [75 percent](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/renewables-cheaper-than-75-percent-of-u-s-coal-fleet-report-finds) of coal production is more expensive than solar or wind and [a third](https://inhabitat.com/one-third-of-the-worlds-power-now-comes-from-renewable-energy/) of the world’s power comes from renewable sources. By 2025 the picture becomes clear … the entire US coal system will be out-competed on cost by wind and solar. The best part? This accounts for the cost of building new turbines and solar panels.

Mike O’Boyle, co-author is the [report for Energy Innovation](https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Coal-Cost-Crossover_Energy-Innovation_VCE_FINAL.pdf), expects “there is huge potential for wind and solar to replace coal, while saving people money.” How’s that for a sustainable future?

**14.** **100 Million Trees Spread Their Roots**

Trees provide the very necessities of life. They give clean air, protect our drinking water, and provide shelter for many. Though, they are still threatened each day.

With the brand-new [Time for Trees Campaign](https://timefortrees.org/), hopes are high and goals are big. By 2022 The Arbor Day Foundation aims to plant 100 million trees around the globe and inspire 5 million people to carry the mission forward. The mission? Removing 578,000 tons of chemical pollution from our air. Now that’s a positive change for all! “Together, we can create change … through trees.” (Arbor Day)

**15. United Together to Save the Bees and Butterflies**

It’s estimated one out of every three bites you take each day was made possible by a pollinator, yet they are at a critical point in their survival. 

Launched back in 2015, the National Pollinator Garden Network released their [Million Pollinator Garden Challenge](http://millionpollinatorgardens.org/). In 2019, they not only reached their goal but surpassed it. Over 1 million gardeners and homeowners have joined the fight to save threatened pollinators. Today, as more people join the fight, the registered gardens add up to 5 million acres of enhanced pollinator habitat.

You don’t have to be a beekeeper to save the planet … just plant some flowers!

**16.** **Scuba Divers Break World Record for Underwater Cleanup**

In 2015, 614 divers led by Ahmed Gabr hunted down plastics under the waves of the Red Sea. This year, led by [Project AWARE](http://www.ourpositiveplanet.com/scuba-divers-break-world-record-for-underwater-cleanup/), 633 divers from North and South America gathered at Deerfield Beach Pier. Together, the participants removed over 3,200 pounds of debris from the ocean!

As shown by the divers, if you want to create change, it’s as easy as a dip in the water. But … bring a buddy and some gear too.

**17.** **Plastic Waste Meets its Match With #Trashtag Challenge**

It seems like there is a new viral trend on social media every day, but this is one I can get behind! It’s rare when a hashtag results in a change to the environment, but the [\#Trashtag](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trashtag-challenge-inspires-bored-teens-and-others-clean-the-planet-2019-03-11/) challenge is doing exactly that.

The challenge is simple: go to a place that has become overrun with plastic or trash, clean it, and post your before and after photos. [UCO Gear](https://blog.ucogear.com/trashtag-project-ambassadaor-profile/) came up with the challenge in 2015, but it hadn’t become viral until a Facebook post tagged “tired teens” featured participants cleaning a polluted forest. And as if the impact hasn’t been big enough, the challenge also increased awareness of important issues … like how many recyclables end up in the trash. 

Challenge accepted.

**18.** **Supermarket Praised for Innovative Packaging**

This past year, social media users went bananas for an eco-friendly solution to plastic packaging. In Chiangmai, Thailand, the [Rimping Supermarket](https://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2019/03/25/thailand-supermarket-uses-banana-leaves-instead-of-plastic-packaging/#5594dc287102) began wrapping their fruits and vegetables in banana leaves and flexible bamboo. This is a common practice among street vendors in tropical climates, but it has never been seen in an international store!

Fun fact: There have been about 9 billion tons of plastic produced to date. How much of that has been recycled? Only 9%. Imagine the change in the world (especially our oceans) would see if all international supermarkets went “au naturale.”

**19.** **Britain Has First Week Without Coal Since Industrial Revolution**

Do you remember Queen Victoria? No? Me neither. It’s exciting to say that Britain has had its first [coal-free week](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/08/britain-passes-1-week-without-coal-power-for-first-time-since-1882) since she was on the throne! Running the networks in England, Scotland and Wales (ouch that’s big), the last coal generator shut down a 1:24 pm on May 1st. Making history, it came back online seven days later.

This achievement came only two years after Britain’s [first coal-free day](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/21/britain-set-for-first-coal-free-day-since-the-industrial-revolution) since the Industrial Revolution. How’s that for improvement?

**20.** **U.S. National Parks Had a Huge Win**

During the second week of March, President Trump signed off on the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, [Management and Recreation Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-29/) – containing 100 bills geared to protect the great outdoors! The act will protect wilderness areas in all 50 states, reinstate the federal conservation fund, and protect Yellowstone from mining.

Though there is still much to do to keep America beautiful, this is a step in the right direction. Are you up to plant trees with [The Arbor Day Foundation](https://www.arborday.org/)? Let’s get this nature!

# Key Takeaways

**1.** **A Better Future for All**

\- Why strive to be your best if you only end up helping yourself? When it comes to being our best selves, we know that we need to look to the future. As you create a future of goodness, continue to let the changes others are making inspire your own actions. And when you act, make sure that you act with the world’s interests in mind … literally.

**2.** **Stand for What Matters**

\- As we have learned from Nick Mallos, “plastics are now found everywhere in the world, throughout the entire marine ecosystem…” Although this is a haunting issue, the EU took a stand against plastics banning 10 types of non-reusables. New York banned plastic bags, and plastic waste met its match with the #Trashtag challenge. People all over the world are standing up for what they believe in – for what matters. Today, you can too.

**3.** **Aim for Continuous Growth** 

\- Michael Grove made it clear that “the UK is already leading the rest of the world by protecting over 30% of our ocean…” However, how he finished the sentence was humbling “…but we know there is more to do.” Even though the UK is leading the world, they want to do more, they are aiming for continuous growth. There is something special here that anyone can learn from. Even if you are the very best (at whatever you do), there is always room for improvement. The aim for continuous growth is noble for it not only benefits oneself, but those around them as well.20 Positive Planet Stories From 2019 … A Report of Change"

0,"Meera Subramanian, in her recent book  *Elemental India: The Natural World at a Time of Crisis and Opportunity* talks about the case of Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, borewell drilling since the 1960s caused the drying up of underground aquifers. The local population has been contructing, recently, rainwater catchments called *johads.* They have also been planting trees in order to reinvigorate the landscape. The author of the book specifically talks about the Alwar district where Rajendra Singh and his organization called Tarun Bharat Sangh started the movement. Similar initiatives have been carried out across 12 other districts as well. In the village of Bhaonta, since the 1980s, *johads* have been built by people who volunteered to take on elaborate construction projects, and this has had huge benefits. For instance, some of the villages were able to reinstate their water table enough to do farming (which was stopped), and this contributed to economic well-being as well.  Further, many women, who were earlier tasked with travelling large distances to get water, have become free of this difficult task. Such practices based on old knowledge systems, had become lost in the wake of modern planning and developmentalist projects. Reviving them can go a long way in battling climate change at the local level.

• It is safe, abundant, and clean to use when compared to fossil fuels. 

Even clean-burning natural gas is at a disadvantage to what renewable energy sources can provide. Enough sunlight comes down on our planet every day that if we could harvest it with solar panels and other forms of collection, we could power everything for an entire year. Because wind is created by the warmth of the sun, it is also virtually limitless. Fossil fuels, in theory, are a finite resource because of how they are created.

• Multiple forms of renewable energy exist. 

Diversification within the renewable energy sector has exploded since the 1970s. From dams that provide hydropower to solar strips that are strong enough to handle the weight of a vehicle and can be turned into roads, we have numerous methods of creating power through the collection of renewable energy. There is greater diversity in this sector when compared to fossil fuel resources.

• It provides the foundation for energy independence. 

Many nations rely on fossil fuels for their society to function under the “modern” definition. These fuels come from a handful of countries that work to control pricing and availability. By developing renewable energy resources, countries can work toward energy independence with a diversified portfolio of energy to access. Although these resources take time to develop, it should be remembered that the current fossil fuel infrastructure has more than a century of development behind it.

• Renewable energy is stable. 

When renewables are creating energy, the power produced is stable and usable, just like any other form of “traditional” power. It is a dependable resource when an infrastructure is available to support it. Jobs are created within the sector as well, creating stability within local economic sectors at the same time. The power created can be distributed through existing grids, which can limit installation costs for some communities.

• It is a technology instead of a fuel. 

Coal must be mined and refined to make it useful. Natural gas must be released and transported. A fossil fuel is created from natural resources, whereas renewable energies are created thanks to the use of technology. For this reason, the pricing of renewable energies will continue to go down as improvements in technology occur. Fossil fuels can see price reductions through mining and refining efficiency improvements, but there will always be an underlying labor cost that will affect pricing and availability.

0,"Hi. I am facing a decision on which I need some advice.

I am currently working in two jobs. One is a company that manufactures and sells 3D printers (the type that prints from plastic filaments). The other company makes money by running a bitcoin mining pool. I'm looking to only keep one of those jobs, as it would be somewhat more practical for me. I'm wondering which one of those two jobs is less unacceptable from ecological standpoint. Intuitively I'm leaning towards 3D printing being less bad, since bitcoin (esp. bitcoin mining) consumes ridiculous amounts of power, but it's kind of hard to say and there are multiple factors in play.

There's of course the third option of ditching both jobs and finding a more eco-friendly one. This might be an option but it's a longer-term goal and I need to make this decision rather soon.

If bitcoin and 3D printing are comparably bad, then I suppose I can just pick whichever is more convenient in other respects and keep looking for a 3rd job as I go.

Thanks for any and all insights into this.Which is worse: 3D printing or bitcoin?"

0,"Hi folks, there's an old 'fact' in Ireland that the 'worst' fruit you can eat here is a kiwi. The reason for this is that it releases  4 times its own weight in carbon being shipped from New Zealand to Ireland. Now, I'm not sure if that is true and I don't want to advocate that it is (although it might well be).  What I would like to know is if anyone knows of  a formula or calculation that would allow me to figure such a thing out.  I've managed to find average fuel outputs for diffident sized vessels as well as average fuel usages at different speeds for different ships.  I was wondering if anyone already has these answers (or formulas) available.  I want to be able to calculate how much fuel (and therefore carbon) has been released shipping my items from around the world (per kg or ton).  

I am aware that there are many different methods of shipping (air freight, train, truck, ship and so on). At the moment I am only concerned with ocean freight.  I am quite literally trying to figure out how much fuel (carbon) is used to import fruits and vegetables into Ireland. This solves a practical problem for me that I can expand onto other areas/models of production.

0,"It seems all discourse surrounding communism(at least in the states, where I live), runs into trouble related to terminology, so I'll define what I'm talking about and what I'm not up front. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'll call communism: A fully state-controlled economy(such as the USSR or modern day North Korea/Cuba), or an economy where the government runs several major corporations, and is represented on most other major corporations(Modern Day China). 

&amp;#x200B;

What I'll call socialism: High levels of regulation, a substantial portion of overall spending in the economy being done by the government.

&amp;#x200B;

With that settled, I do not believe, as many commenters and their upvoters seem to, that communism is a solution to our climate crisis. Let's look at some common sentiments I've seen, and my responses to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. *The profit motive is incompatible with climate action.* A key component of any successful government shifting of the actions of private entities(individuals and corporations) is shifting the profit motive towards the public good. In this case, using carrots, sticks, and regulations, to make it so the best way to make money is to fight climate change. As an example of this type of program in the states, a cap and trade program added to the clean air act in 1990 successfully stopped the widespread occurrence of acid rain. Now, climate change is a much bigger, and more global, threat than acid rain was, so change much more ambitious than a cap and trade program are needed. But the government has the ability to enact such policies without destroying capitalism. 
2. *Infinite Growth is incompatible with a planet with finite resources.* While it's true our planet is technically finite, and that economic models of a healthy economy require constant growth in GDP, our planet has vast amounts of most materials we need, and many others can be synthesized. Historically, when materials become rarer, humanity learns to synthesize them. Should a material come in very short supply, the market will increase demand things its made of will decline. Also, given an electric transportation system, industrial capacity, and resource extraction(which I've argued above aren't incompatible with capitalism), the only practical constraining limit for our production of most things is energy. And the theoretical solar capability of Earth is astounding. If you wanted to look even further out, a dyson sphere would give us practically infinite energy for billions of years.Opinion: Communism is not a solution to the world's climate crisis"

Such a lifestyle is depicted as dystopian, but why is that? Why is it not utopian? Why is the utopian lifestyle the lifestyle of waste and excess eg living in the suburbs in an oversized four bedroom house, driving a huge SUV and commuting two hours to work everyday, having five children and taking annual overseas vacations.

0,"**Definitions of parasite :** 

*  In evolutionary biology, parasitism is a relationship between species, where **one** organism, the **parasite**, lives on or in another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life (quick [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism))
*  An organism living in, with, or on another organism in parasitism ([webster #2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parasite))
*  A creature that lives off another organism is a parasite. The parasite might not hurt the host, **but it doesn't do anything to help it, either** (nice one from [Vocabulary](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/parasite))
*  Some one who sponges everything out of you even your last breath given have the chance (sometimes a little [UrbanDictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=parasite) is fun)
* Organism obtaining nourishment from or living one another organism (the 'host') for survival and **usually harming it and causing disease**. Some parasites are independent and some depend entirely on their hosts **and separate only when either one of them die (**[Business Dictionary](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/parasite.html), not kidding)
*  An organism that obtains nourishment and shelter on another organism ([Biology Online](https://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Parasite) Two biologists giving info)
*  Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship, or long-term relationship between two species, where one member, the parasite, gains benefits that come at the expense of the host member. The word parasite comes from the Latin form of the Greek word *παράσιτος (parasitos)*, meaning “one who eats at the table of another”. (Awesome one ! Found [here](https://biologydictionary.net/parasitism/). It gives many parasitism variants. Check it out (always with caution, it is not in the top 10 of google search, maybe it hsould be (/s added for intentional purposes)
*  **Parasites** are plants or animals that live on or in a host getting their nutrients from that host. A **host** is an organism that supports a parasite. Sometimes the host is harmed by the parasite, and sometimes the relationship is neutral. But the host never benefits from the arrangement. When the parasite does have a negative impact on the host, it doesn't often kill the host directly, but the stressors that come with having parasites can kill. (from [study dot com](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-parasite-definition-types-examples.html) go to the study transcript, locked by registering for the full access... sorry)
* Some might fancy the term ""leech"" (parasitic/predatory organisms) to be more appropriate. But some have been used as positive!.. Humans never.

 I avoided all sources from sites defining social parasites : ""a lazy person who lives by getting money, food etc from other people"". Humans social parasites are also an effect of sapiens parasiting even itself.

Humans are parasites, on an evolutionnary and planetary scale. They pray on their environment without giving back, for they are aware now (let's say since tool age) they must be the prevalent specie on this planet. No compromises.

A powerful parasite that doesn't want to die, but still unaware of its host, even in low populations tribesthat will feed on nature but will struggle to prevent nature feeding on them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Means used** : 

Google search in English (that skips a lot of information, i am aware of this)

Browsed +-200 results, skipping the social parasites as referred on many sites (humans taking advantage on other humans, any scale) skipping human hosting parasites as a disease, skipping the definitions in other languages, skipping some lost tribes that **also modify their environment** to fit their needs and would do the same if tools were found/provided, skipping technology that 'could' save sapiens (see futurology with their illusions, see ""the plans that we'll never see"" if you are not filthy rich, [see the world in 2000 seen by people in the 1900](https://www.laterredufutur.com/accueil/il-y-a-100-ans-les-artistes-etaient-invites-a-imaginer-le-monde-de-lan-2000/)) Look for ""technology will save the world"" omitting the millions of death to save the few, see also people trying to be better but posting their accompmishment using high end non renewable tech with cloud computing. 

Be aware i'm posting this on a cloud based server, vomit a little. Learn to use your hands and brains. Once elecricity is off, you are no one but what you know.

&amp;#x200B;

First part. Hope i didn' break any rule.Humans are unregulated parasites. And there is no escape to this fact. Not even if you live as a secluded tribe in a forest."

But In literal and symbolic efforts to help curb climate change, we need to unify the day globally, so that the entire earth is committing to it at the same time. I especially like India's version, [Van Mahotsav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Mahotsav), which is a week-long festival. \*

&amp;#x200B;

I think a good goal to start would be \~ **10 billion planted a year**. That's everyone in the world (\~ 7.5 Billion)  committing to plant 1 tree +  companies and governments adding in another 2.5 billion. 

&amp;#x200B;

[That study](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/planting-1-2-trillion-trees-could-cancel-out-a-decade-of-co2-emissions-scientists-find) around using tree's to capture carbon said we need to plant additional **1.2 trillion trees**, which means it would take us 120 years to do it. It has to be quicker than that. So the idea would be moving the goal post up by 1 billion every year.  Someone better at math will be able to figure out what the number of years actually is, but I imagine it's below 50 (right?) 

\*Now I read that they do it in July because it's just before monsoon season (which [parts of India desperately need](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/asia/india-water-crisis.html) at the moment) .. it's possible that some locations aren't ideal on the same day ... but even symbolically, I think we need to all come together on this at this point.

I'm a college student from Washington State and after meeting with a conservative leader to discuss climate change reform, I got the excuse that 100% clean energy, despite there being a bill being passed for it, is a pipe dream in my state because we don't have sufficient battery capacity in any modern technology to support the power grid. I suspected that this was a well crafted deflection, a ploy allowing them to continue opposing climate change reform while pretending to support it, so I did a little research.

I found this article *Response to ‘Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems’*. It's a great article that refutes many of the arguments perpetrated by those who wish to prolong the use of fossil fuels.

Have we not figured how to use 100 percent of it.  It can be converted all to heat or some other energy.  Matter can’t be created or destroyed but it can be converted to energy.  Yes or no. 

Shouldn’t we concentrate on creating things that can save and help the world or destruction is the only way to profit. 

Remember when appliances lasted a lifetime. Guess it’s better to make garbage so we can keep consuming and making waste.  

Everything should leave no waste no trace that we were ever there.  That is technology.  What we are doing lacks logic and intelligence.  Do you buy a bag of potatoes keep one throw out the rest.   Basically it’s what we are doing.  I have  seen ppl order meals eat 1/4 of it throw the rest out so I guess we have some wasteful ppl in the world.  No wonder it’s all screwed up.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti: “The  interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a  climate thing at all… we really think of it as a  how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing”

Saikat Chakrabarti is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff.

On July 10, 2019, the Washington Post [published](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/07/10/feature/how-saikat-chakrabarti-became-aocs-chief-of-change/) the following: (the bolding is mine)

*Chakrabarti had an unexpected disclosure. “****The interesting thing about the Green New Deal****,” he said, “****is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all****.”  Ricketts greeted this startling notion with an attentive poker face.  “Do you guys think of it as a climate thing?” Chakrabarti continued.  “Because* ***we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.****”*

It’s been said before by libertarians and conservatives that the  environmental doomsayer movement is like a watermelon – green on the  outside and red on the inside. Chakrabarti’s statement verifies this  claim.

In the 1970s, environmental doomsayers referred to their alleged  upcoming environmental apocalypse as “overpopulation.” In the 1990s,  they called it “global warming.” And now in the 2010s, they are calling  it “climate change.” In all three of these cases, the environmental  doomsayers have claimed that the only way to prevent these alleged  environmental disasters from happening is to have the government take  control over properly, resources, energy, the economy, jobs, and the  means of production.

Chakrabarti’s statement proves what many of us libertarians and  conservatives have known all along: for many of its participants, the  environmental doomsayer movement is just an excuse to massively increase  the size and power of government control over everyone and everything.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti: “The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn’t originally a climate thing at all… we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing”"

I was recently discussing it with a friend who works in oil and gas and upon stating my displeasure with liquid natural gas extraction projects in my home nation (Canada) he responded by saying that it was better to have them in a regulated environment such as Canada rather that somewhere in the developing world where environmental and social impacts would be more severe due to the lack of environmental regulation. He continued to suggest that if Canada stopped extracting Liquid natural gas companies would just move to one of these less regulated sites. Is this true ? Why wouldn’t companies be operating there as well right now ? I don’t know the economics of resource extraction well enough to wrap my head around answering this question.

Would Canada stopping LNG extraction increase production elsewhere ? Or are extraction companies already operating at maximum capacity everywhere they can?Is this a fallacy?"

The IPCC will make you think we have until 2060 to drop emissions 100%. This is not true because they only include emissions in that scenario backdated to the 1880s. This sort of hijinks is completely normal in the modern world. Fortunately, some scientists are brave enough to speak out. Of course, those are the ones you never hear about.

Trees Will Not Save Us

For some weird reason, even Mother Jones may have gotten this one right.

https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/07/trees-will-not-save-us-from-climate-change/

We emit about 100 gigatons of carbon per decade, which results in a rise in carbon of about 10 ppm / decade. This overly simplified rule of thumb is useful for imagining what the future holds. The only certainty is that the rate of change changes, or in other words, things will get 'worse than expected'. But you already knew that.

The reason that methane started rising again in 2009 is because of fracking and Arctic wetlands. 

Fracking expert Dr. Anthony Ingraffea says we hit 2° C by 2030. While he may not be right about this, neither is he wrong. The Arctic Tundra is turning into mud, and Natalie Shakova has renewed her warning. Natalie doesn't sit in front of a computer all day hyping books.

This post began with a link saying we must reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to avoid 3° C. But 2° C is the runaway ignition point to 2 processes, mass extinction and hothouse earth. Here is some simple arithmetic to use as a memory aide.

2° C = runaway mass extinction + runaway hothouse earth

**Reminders**

Claire Fyson said emissions must go down 50% in 10 yrs to avoid 1.5° C. That was one year ago.

Stefan Rahmstorf said emissions must go down 100% in 20 yrs to avoid 2.0C. That was three years ago.

Hans Schellnhuber said 5 major hothouse tipping points start below 2° C and will ignite 8 more major tipping points. This is one of the most important studies, ever. It was ignored.

Runaway hothouse cannot be stopped or reversed once started.

Mass extinction cannot be stopped or reversed once started.

0,"So I had the chance to live i three countries which are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. I would like to observe the changes I have observed: 

Saudi Arabia: I grew up here so I have the best insight about this country. I remember when I was younger we had real winters. It never got below 0 but close to it and never above 20 degrees. We never had to turn on the acs during winter. In fact, it was so cold that all of us (my family) would sleep in one room under big blankets and it would be a really enjoyable time of the year. Fast forward to last year, and it just felt like a cooler summer. It felt like there was no winter at all except really early in the morning, but other times i could do fine without a jacket. It wasnt just me, we all noticed how different it is from before. We even got lesser rain than we used to. My father told me that when he first moved here it used to get cold enough that a person died one time because of it (might have been an old bedouin). 

Russia (Siberia specifically): I moved to Russia to learn Russian and do undergrad. Winter came early and stayed for a long time to the point I felt that all my life has passed in winter. It was common for the weather to fall below -20 degrees celsius, and some rare moments it would even get as cold as -44 especially around February. However, every person I talked to would say that -40 was much more frequent before and the winters lasted even longer than it already does. 

Pakistan: Now I haven’t lived so much here. I never spent winter here, tho my family originates from here. However I can speak on insight that its gotten warmer here too. We come from Northern Pakistan so it would be cooler up there than Saudi Arabia. I was told that when my parents were younger there would be more hail storms and even snow on rare occasions. Now, the hail storms are rarer and it practically never snows.

0,"By 2050, there will be at least 2bn cars on the world's roads. If all of those cars were EVs, annual production of neodymium and dysprosium would need to increase by 70% and stay at that level until 2050. On the same basis, annual copper output would need to increase 100%, and cobalt output would need to increase by at least 250% to meet global demand.

The increase in renewable energy infrastructure needed to provide power for EVs would also consume more metals and minerals. Wind turbines require a lot of steel, while solar panel installations consume several scarce minerals, such as high purity silicon, indium, tellurium and gallium. Extracting the minerals themselves is also a power-hungry process, adding to demand.

https://www.petroleum-economist.com/articles/midstream-downstream/power-generation/2019/ev-revolution-could-stall-due-to-mineral-shortages

Demand for copper, for example, could rise by 275 to 350% by 2050, according to academics at Yale University. The World Bank estimated in 2017 that action to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C from pre-industrial levels could mean a seven-fold increase in demand for cobalt and an 11-fold increase in demand for lithium by 2050.

The current EU target is to ramp up production of Electric Vehicles 200 times by 2030. But, here’s the thing – this would lead to an increased demand for production inputs of cobalt, lithium and nickel and copper to build the electrical vehicles. However at 100 times the demand world cobalt resources would be exhausted in 8 months, lithium in 5 years, nickel in 4 months and copper in 5 months.

https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/deep-sea-mining-metal-resources-advanced-technology-devel/

If, as the IEA predicts, there are 125 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road by 2030, it will require roughly 10 million tonnes of copper – a 50% increase over current annual global copper consumption (20 million tonnes).

The additional wind turbines built by 2030 would require roughly two million tonnes of copper – about 10% of the world’s current production.

That’s not even taking into account how much copper would be needed for a quadrupling of solar power, and all the enhancements to the electrical grid and charging infrastructure for electric vehicles that will be required.

Given how much aluminum, metallurgical coal, copper, aluminum, zinc and rare earths are required for each wind turbine and each EV – and how much lithium and cobalt are needed for EV batteries – it begs the question: Will the transition to a low-carbon economy lead to “peak metals” (the point of maximum metal production)?

The targets that governments are setting for themselves for electric vehicle and renewable energy adoption will require a massive increase in mining, and there’s some question as to whether the new mines required can even be built in time to meet the demand according to the timelines being set.

https://www.mining.com/global-energy-transition-powers-surge-demand-metals/

Rare earth metals are used in solar panels and wind turbines—as well as electric cars and consumer electronics. We don't recycle them, and there's not enough to meet growing demand.

First of all, sorry for my bad english.

I'm from Italy and I don't know if you can help me.

In 2 days there will be a musical concert (Jova Beach Party) on the beaches of Rimini, a famous italian tourist location. Those beaches are home of an [endangered species](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadrius_alexandrinus) . 

Is there anything I can do about it?

   
 [Source 1](https://www.chiamamicitta.it/spostare-rimandare-jova-beach-party-esposto-ambientalisti-alla-procura-rimini/) [Source 2](https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/cronaca/2019/07/08/esposto-contro-jova-beach-party_wdl2FpZYPtIDTXVczTNqQJ.html) [Source 3](https://bologna.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/07/08/news/arriva_il_beach_tour_di_jovanotti_a_rimini_esposto_in_procura_degli_ambientalisti-230689184/)

I translated some info found on local online newspaper:

*After appeals to the two Municipalities ""to common sense and collaboration"" to try to protect the four chicks of fratino, a protected species, present in the area of ​​the event, the associations AsOER, Italia Nostra Rimini, Legambiente and Lipu sent a complaint, among others, to the Public Prosecutor of Rimini and to the Ministry.*

   
 

*The Fratino (Charadrius alexandrinus) - the environmental associations recall - is a small bird that nests on European beaches. In Europe since the beginning of the century there has been a consistent decrease. In Italy it is estimated that the population is less than 700 pairs, in continuous decline. In Emilia-Romagna there are now only 30-40 couples (one tenth of those present in the 1980s). The species lays in April-May directly in small hollows of the sand from 1 to 3 eggs and can, in case of failure, try a second nesting between May and June. The incubation period for the eggs is 24-27 days. The young, after 24/36 hours from birth, follow their parents in search of food; they are able to fly at 28 days of age.*

   
 

*On the coast between Rimini and Riccione there are currently four chicks that, as stated in the statement, will not be able to fly before July 15 and ""there is a high probability that they will be crushed and involuntarily killed"". For this reason, considering that about 40 thousand people will attend the Jova Beach Party, the associations ask that the event be moved to another place or postponed to a date after July 25th.*A musical concert near an endangered species nest"

Just because you accept collapse, doesn't mean you should make rash life decisions.

If you are a McPhersonite, and believe humans will be extinct in 10 years, then you are going to make big mistakes that will ruin your life and accelerate collapse.

You might be dreaming of living in a van, that will be the worst decision you ever made.

James Hansen and Rachael Carson are my heros. You are at the apex of the history of all life on this planet, and what goes through your mind right now is more important to life on earth than at anytime throughout human history.

A letter to my parents (and many other parents of millennial children)

Throughout the world, the alarm bells that have been ringing for well over a decade now are finally starting to be heard. Freak weather events, record breaking heatwaves and highest temperatures year after year, distinct absences of frosty mornings in the winter, periods of drought and then weeks of heavy rain. Angry young people are telling politicians to sit down, shut up and listen, taking to the street with placards essentially begging for a shot at their future, before its robbed from us and generations to come. 

I don’t know how to persuade the complacent older generation who convivially laugh about how they’ll be dead before it’s a real problem for them - but Mum, Dad, I won’t be. I will be very much alive and so will (god willing) your grandchildren. You raised me to be successful, the scientist that I am. I have had the benefit of higher education that you have not so perhaps I have had the (mis)fortune of having these issues thrust in my face to analyse, to critique, to evidence and find solutions for. I can assure you now that you will not be dead before it’s an issue, because it’s an issue now. At the predicted pinnacle of all this climate chaos, in 2100, your grandchildren will be alive and fighting to stay cool, fighting for clean drinking water and adequate food, fighting for space and resources with millions of climate refugees who will be leaving equatorial areas in the next few decades. I do not want to hear that it is not your problem any more, because I am your daughter and it is my problem, and therefore yours.

Do you know that I am considering not having children at all? Since my late teens I dreamed of having a family, having children and raising them to be good and kind. But raising my children right may be the least of my concerns if I must arm them with the skills and wherewithal to cope with a planet that is slowly dying. You can have them during school holidays and feed them ice cream and take them to nice places, but when you hand them back to me, I must ensure that their future is secure for them seeing as ‘you’ll be dead’, so who cares. I must ensure that when I die, they are savvy enough to cope, they are tenacious enough to fight for resources. What if I must raise my children to live selfishly to ensure their survival? What if I everything I endeavour to preach, to be kind, to be generous, I have to double back on and preach instead to be cut-throat and vicious? I am not sure I can truly justify bringing new lives into this planet to condemn them to a life of suffering and fighting.

You may think me over dramatic but remember how proud you were when I graduated with my first degree and then my Masters. I have armed myself with analytical skills, I have privileged access to reams of scientific evidence that supports that modern climate change is perpetuated by human activity. Despite there being accessible evidence for the general public freely available, I know you won’t look for it or read it or take it seriously. But believe *me*. Trust *me*. Trust that I am not making this up, I am not being over-dramatic. Believe that I am scared and that you should be too. For my sake and the sake of your grandchildren. 

I would imagine from my (fortunately) limited understanding that coming to realise what trouble the planet is really in is like being diagnosed with cancer. Sat across from a professional who knows better than you, who is trained in these things and highly qualified, telling you that, potentially, you’re absolutely fucked. But. If you start treatment and you start it NOW, there is a chance that you can kick its ass after a bit of time, though you won’t be the same after. Your family won’t be the same. You will go forward in life from now on carefully considering your diet, your level of activity, the products you put on your body and clean your home with. I can imagine that it’s a shock to the system, to look at your life and realise the magnitude of change you must undertake. Knowing that it isn’t just down to you, it’s down to everyone. Your colleagues, your neighbours, your family, your friends, the server who brought you your food, the men who collect your rubbish, the newsreaders on the TV, that comedian you laugh at. What are they doing? What’s the point if they’re not doing a thing either? They’re ignoring this cancer - surely it’ll go away if we just change to energy-saving light bulbs and make sure the tap isn’t running while we brush our teeth... 

I guarantee you if you start making a change tomorrow, someone will see that and think – shit. If you’re doing something, maybe I should too. Maybe this is serious. After all, your daughter is a scientist, she’d know. And Mum, Dad, you should know. This isn’t a secret. This isn’t new. This is real. You might both be sun worshippers and be enjoying this ‘global warming lark’, but it isn’t to be laughed at. It is time to sit down, shut up and listen.A letter to my parents"

The environmental challenges we currently face, and action needed to tackle the climate crisis cannot be accomplished without collaboration. Businesses and stakeholders need to partner across industries and through global supply chains to truly deliver impact at a transformative scale.

The circular economy is a production and consumption model that aims to minimize waste while maximizing resources. It has become increasingly popular as corporations strive to become more sustainable and reduce waste, in line with emerging consumer preferences. Circularity also provides avenues for  innovation and creative business models, production, and supply chains. 

This webinar will explore how we can embrace a circular economy model and leverage collaborations to decarbonize our supply chains.

Hear from our panelists about their successes, challenges, and future business opportunities of incorporating sustainable practices from manufacturing to delivery.Want to learn about sustainable supply chains and the circular economy? Join us."

So I lived across the street from Lake Michigan my entire life. I spent many a summer exploring the waters along our coast lines and slowly but surely our coast line moved further out.

Within ten years there was a submerged pier that was so far under water and buried that no one knew it was there until I was 27.

The water moved away from the rock lined coast and over the years it keeps receding.

Hi /r/environment. On June 28, Governor Mike Dunleavy cut the University of Alaska system's budget by $130 million. This is a HUGE blow to the university, and a lot of people could lose their jobs over this.

The Arctic is especially vulnerable to climate change, and University of Alaska and its faculty's research is heavily involved in monitoring the environmental impacts in the region. This cut would cripple the University's ability to support these researchers, at a time where it's crucial we understand how the Arctic is responding to global warming.

The bottom line: **WE NEED YOUR HELP!**

This message is sent by faculty at University of Alaska at Fairbanks (UAF) to their colleagues, but please take the time as a concerned citizen to express your disapproval of this measure:

&gt;The Governor of Alaska decided last week to cut the University of Alaska system state budget by 41% ($135 million). The Alaska legislature can vote to override the Governor's actions but 45/60 legislators need to agree...by July 8th. 

&gt;UAF is calling on collaborators and researchers external to the UA system to chime in and express their concern for these cuts and voice support of overriding the Governor's veto. This is a big ask...but if any of you have the time, it would be very helpful if you could take a minute to email the AK legislature, in your capacity as a polar researcher express support of a veto override. 

&gt;You can use this link to automatically generate an email with addresses for the House or Senate... https://www.uaf.edu/chancellor/initiatives-and-policies/advocacy/akleg.php

Thank you!!University of Alaska System just got its budget cut by $130 Million. We desperately need your help!"

I can’t be the only one here that has money in the markets. While the maxims typically go “you can’t time the market” and “time in market beats timing in market,” climate change is a different category all together that will have ripple effects across the globe and through society.

Have any of you given thought as to when to pull out of the markets in anticipation of the markets tanking? Climate change, for now, seems to be a slow burn (pun unintended) rather than a dramatic shift, meaning that the markets won’t feel this impact for some time.

At the moment fossil fuels are needed for pretty much everything, construction, transport, power generation etc. People have dabbled with other sources of energy but it seems that they cant provide the amount of energy we truly need. The car industry have started pushing out electric cars but even then alot of fossil fuel is burned to actually make the car, and most likely fossil fuels were burned to generate the electricity to charge the cars. So what happens after fossil fuels run out? Its all good having an elctric car but what if you are unable to charge it? And is it possible to be 100% clean?

0,"For example, if your country averages to 10 tons of CO2 per person, that's a thousand dollars every year per person to actually directly (unlike funding solar energy in africa, which is another beast) offset their carbon emissions for that year.  


That's about 80000$ per person's lifetime, if prices and consumption were to remain the same. It isn't easy to fund, and it certainly isn't impossible.  


Of course we will soon be needing negative emissions, and that's why the emissions per capita is going to have to keep going down, as will the price of carbon capture.  


US yearly emissions per capita in 2017: 15.7 tons

China yearly emissions per capita in 2017: 7.7 tons  
European Union yearly per capita in 2017: 7 tons  
World average: 4.9 tonsThe price of capturing a ton of carbon will soon be 100$. Do the carbon math"

I went upstairs and waited until he came and i asked him ""can I talk to you"" he answered ""yes"". I asked him about the cuts and he told me he had a hard time and I talked to him about it and why it's not good and told him I also do it. the he went away after we talked. I sat down and started thinking after like 4 minutes of thinking I went back to work. He came back and wanted to talked he thanked me for being nice and helping. I talked to him and asked him why he started and what happened he told me he has 2 mothers and that was one of the reasons he got bullied at school. I talked to him and said not to listen to them and that it's cool having 2 moms becouse I have a friend that has 2 moms and they are really nice. He told me he tried to kill himself once and he got put in a mental hospital for children, (I have also been there). I told him when he gets home to talk to his mothers and tell them he wants help, becouse he really wants it. I also told him that if he doesn't have anyone to talk to he can always come to my work when I'm working.

So if you see anyone who has scars from cutting ask if everything is alright and if they wanna talk becouse just asking can help.please read this."

2: BLACK WATER - Type of used water contaminated with your faeces and urine. In short the water used in the flush of your toilet

You can reuse only the grey water, not the black water. 
1: You can use the water filtered from your ac. This is the water which is absorbed by the ac to cool your room, the ac absorbs moisture from your room and filter it out in the process.

0,"Hello,

Sorry if I made grammar mistake or if I am not clear, English is not my native language.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if there is a website where everyone can participate in listing the problems related to the current ecological crisis and the solutions we have/can develop. I have bachelor in earth sciences so obviously I feel concerned about climate change and the mass extinction currently happening, but I am not a engineer nor a biologist or an ecologist.

By working together and listing the problem and what we can do about it, if we are enough to do it, we can influence the politics. What would be also great is to find solutions everyone can do ""alone"" (example : find a way to grow some food indoor --&gt; reduce the food you buy that come from intensive farming).

&amp;#x200B;

This is currently some of the main points I have in mind (I did not write everything):

1. detailed list of problems (ex : **melting permafrost** (this is the example I use here to clarify my point))
2. direct consequences (albedo is decreasing)
3. indirect consequences (worsen climate warming, sea level rise, reduction of emerged surface, population migration)
4. solutions to the problem (reduce greenhouse gas emission, compensate decrease of albedo)
5. ways to apply these solutions
   1. **reduce greenhouse gas emission**: 
      1. plant trees, 
      2. factories that stock CO2 (not effective), 
      3. regrow seagrass, seaweed and corals, 
      4. use bikes with a system that stock CO2 when you pedal, 
      5. put bryophyte and lichen on facade of buildings,
      6. ""grow"" stromatolites,
   2. **increase earth albedo**:
      1. use garbage that has a high albedo and place them in regions with long hours of sunshine like desert,
      2. send garbage with low albedo in orbit around earth so they absorb some of the indicent rays,
      3. etc.
6. direct advantage and other use possible
   1. **greenhouse gas emission part** (we will focus on this problem only and not on albedo for the examples below)
      1. trees: wood is extremely useful
      2. factories: ??
      3. seagrass: protect wildlife and flora, seabed fixing, reduce pathogens, can be use to make furniture; seaweed: can be used as food and fertilizer
      4. bike: bikes are everywhere and cheap to buy
      5. etc.
   2. increase earth albedo (not detailed)
7. impact/efficiency
   1. trees: huge
   2. factories: limited (less efficient than tress)
   3. seaweed, seagrass and corals: huge
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
8. difficulties encountered
   1. trees: deforestation, reduce of usable surfaces
   2. factories: high climate impact when construction of factories, materials are not recyclable
   3. seaweed, seagrass and corals: reduce of territory by invasive algae, photic zone is perturbed, corals are very fragile, sensitive to pH and water level
   4. bike: need to find recyclable materials
   5. etc.
9. solutions to the difficulties
   1. trees: stop deforestation, transform livestock area into forest
   2. factories: technology, need to find recyclable materials
   3. seaweed, seagrass: transplantation, habitat protection, corals: help corals to adapt in laboratory?
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
10. complexity:
   1. trees: extremely simple
   2. factories: very complex
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: very complex??
   4. bike: ??
   5. etc
11. time to set this up
   1. trees: long
   2. factories: very long
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: very long??
   4. bikes: ??
   5. etc
12. Urgency
   1. trees: extremely urgent
   2. factories: not urgent
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: extremely urgent
   4. bikes: not urgent
   5. etc
13. financial cost + qualification of the workforce
   1. trees: cost: very low; do not need qualification
   2. factories: cost; very high? need qualification
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: cost ?? need high qualification
   4. bikes: cost: ?? qualification: ??
   5. etc
14. cost in energy
   1. trees: very low
   2. factories: very high
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: ?
   4. bikes: ?
   5. etc
15. achievable by a private company ?
   1. trees: yes (sell wood)
   2. factories: ??
   3. seaweed, seagrass, corals: yes for seagrass (make furnitures) and seaweed (make food and fertilizer) 
   4. bikes: yes
   5. etc

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, to make the most exhaustive list possible, we need as many people as possible, because for example, I don't know what can be the impact of creating bikes that stock CO2. 

My idea is to first make a list where we can find as many idea as possible solutions companies can use, and we propose the other solutions to politicians.

&amp;#x200B;

The purpose of the list is also to make diagrams to help decision making:

* urgency (point 12) vs complexity (point 10)
* efficiency (point 7) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)
* energy cost (point 14) vs efficiency (point 7)
* urgency (point 12) vs complexity (point 10) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)
* efficiency (point 7) vs complexity (point 10) vs time to set the solution up (point 11)

0,"I'm a Civil Engineering student who's studied transportation, traffic, and city planning to a decent extent. It is better to have more dense cities with lots of options to walk, bike, or use rail.  

Unfortunately many American cities grew after the personal car became popularized. This caused cities to sprawl. The damage has been done. We can make efforts to reverse it. Kansas City and other municipalities have reintroduced street cars, which is phenomenal and these efforts should continue to be pushed. But the most realistic option is to switch to electric cars and clean energy. America's road network isn't going away, there's too much rural land and suburbs which rely heavily on the automobile. 

Not only is public transportation greener, it's also much safer. I work at a state DOT. The department always preaches that the number one goal is to have zero roadway deaths annually. There was a good downward trend as seatbelts became accepted and safety standards increase. However as smartphones gained popularity the deaths began rising again.  

So a push for public transportation needs to be made, but the nations transport will not switch away from cars in the next few decades. But it's possible to get the vast majority of cars to run on electric in the next 20 years. It's possible for us to completely cut reliance on coal in 20 years. It needs to be done.  

Thoughts?The best way to make America's transportation system more green is more public transportation. More rail. But getting that investment from the tax payers is unlikely. Americans are too used to their cars and road system, electric cars and clean power is the most realistic option."
0,"Dear all:

Most of us on this sub care about the environment except for a few brigadiers etc. 

A lot of us are vegetarian, a lot of us are vegan, a lot of us avoid palm oil, a lot of us save water, a lot of us do a lot. It is incredibly admirable and the right thing to do no question. 

How much of an impact this really has on the environment is minimal. If you live in a house (god forbid you have money) or rent an apartment, you’re “choosing” (consumer choices) to pay for something that has caused huge local and global damage. The cement, the glass, the electricity etc, are all things that go into the creation of a modern (western? Jk what a terrible word) home, that have high emissions.

Should you live on the street and not cause any damage? Yes. Is that feasible/ is anyone going to do it? No is the answer about 99.9% of the time. The less you have, the harder this is to be homeless. So what are we to do and who is at fault/causing our planet to die? 

Obviously you’re already aware but it’s the corporations and government. They hold the power to stop what they are doing. The only thing that prevents them from doing anything is their own greed. 

So what’s the solution to this? Direct action. There are forms like signing up CEO’s to hundreds of news letters or calling them over and over. All this will do is cause them to make a new email address and change their number. 

More has to be done, it is time to act. What is it that I’m suggesting?

While it has been essential for raising discussion, the Paris Agreement does not go nearly far enough. Feigning progress on this front might do more damage than good, and actually destroy the momentum towards united and global changes.

0,"This is a long one hour interview I conducted with Roger Hallam last week and posted on friday on YouTube

The post was originally made in philosophy and was upvoted but moderator then closed it - so I hope its OK to repost here -  it is about the philosophy behind Extinction Rebellion and also their announcement due shortly of a massive global uprising aimed at sweeping away the politcal elites that have failed to do anything about the eenvironment for 30 years whle paying it lip service

 Roger is mainly focused on political philosophy - the theory of how dissent is best voiced in a democracy once democratic means have failed. His answer, as we all know, is civil disobedience. He is well on the way to hundreds of thousands of supporters turning out for the next big action, in October.

Hallam has studied successful rebellions from the American Revolution onwards, and learned the lessons. Now he is applying them to the climate battle. He has politicians begging him to work with them, but he is steadfastly “refusing to be co-opted.”

Aim is to have Citizens Assemblie take over from politicians who are discredited because they have failed to act for 30 years.

Green New Deal dismissed as window dressing.

Extinction Rebellion (XR) ran a protest in New York City last week when 70 people were arrested outside the NY Times.

It is planning more strikes over the next few weeks and months, demanding radical action on climate change. Whole cities will be brought to a halt until governments listen and negotiate

Hallam says groups are springing up all over America, the UK and the rest of the world. “The political class are going to do everything apart from anything,” he said. “There's going to be a rebellion in America against the government this autumn.” Plans will be announced next week for a global month of action

The former organic farmer turned Politics PhD student at Kings College London explains in the interview why Western nations need a revolution to protect the environment. “Climate change is baked in now,” he said. “We cannot avoid it.

0,"The angle I'm coming from is more physics based, energy consumption, energy conservation, energy efficiency, carbon omissions, atmospheric constituents. There are cross overs with earth science I suppose, but also psychology as the human tendancy to miscalculate and bias.

I'm looking to understand with evidence and peer review papers the recycling of domestic packaging and it's effectiveness on the environment. This I'm looking to compare with our other impacts on environment, and how it compares with any gains from changes in behaviours, and which would be more impactful.

I'm not looking at the side benefits of recycling, example being getting the subject into conversation to move people toward awareness, the types of things I'm looking for example at finding data and quantified research that looks at whether recycling is effective, it's hidden cost, the positives and negatives, comparisons to other consumption (eg cars, meat, flying, agriculture), and so determine the skew of importance that people place on recycling plastics v their perceptions of impact.

My question that I'm building upon, it's that do people place a distorted value to the impact of recycling when more gain can be made with a move of focus on other areas of energy consumption.

From a personal experience, witnessing individuals having emotional strong opinions on recycling, to the point of critisms of others behaviour, but whilst they continue eating large quantities of meat, driving a car, and traveling multiple flights, is hypocritical or at least misguided. I want to know if my intuition is flawed. Perhaps it's both, and that people tend to do what they are comfortable in doing, something is better than nothing, albeit from a non informed position.

I'm looking to challenge my own thinking here.

In secondary knowledge gain, I'm looking for studies that highlight where real gains for changing behaviours and government polices would be had for improved impact to environmental health, example being research and development of hydrogen as a fuel for transportation, investments in infrastructure for electric cars and improved battery manufacturing and disposal.

I've access to academic libraries, and I've carried out some initial simple searches. It seems have to do some refining and cross referencing to find what I'm looking for, so I'm reaching out incase anyone here can point me to some studies that might save me some time or if there are areas in this subject I should consider and broaden my approach. If anyone has expertise in this area and or related areas I would love to hear your points.Do people place a distorted value to the impact of recycling on the environment v the impacts of other areas of energy consumption that could be addressed by the individual?"

Anyhoo, one of the most practical easy ones to use, especially from my point of view living in a somewhat rural area in PNW where mushrooms would happily grow, is growing mycelial mats on areas next to highways, old logging roads, lakesides &amp; where preventative erosion control is needed.

Oyster mushrooms, native to temperate forests of PNW (Pacific Northwest), are known as the bee's knees of easy growing shrooms. Regular woodchips, bought at building supplies stores amongst many places available, can be mixed -inoculated- with oyster spores and will germinate with enough water. The hope is that spores can germinate before, in a commercial lab setting before being introduced to the substrate.

https://i.redd.it/x8uyl9wflj731.jpg

Once spores germinate, they weave together and grow, while converting the woodchips into healthy soil. This network of fibers encourages plant growth and health.

I remember having and Oberweis cooler in front of my house and walking out to have a gallon of milk and chocolate milk like 2 or 3 times a week. Then when we finished we would put the empty glass container in the cooler and on the day we would get a restock they would take the empty glass back. Never used a plastic milk jug during that service.

I have seen stores like Trader Joes and Marianos that have seeds/seasoning/nut dispensers where you bring in your empty glass container, fill it, and pay. No plastic.

So why don't we do that with meat? Is it because glass can shatter if stored in a deep freezer, or will crack if taken from freezer to fridge due to uneven heating? Sanitation?

Casual watcher of political debate the other night as UK politics once again proves we're really not much better than trump.

An activist was asking politicians if they could cut the target to 2025. No surprises that they all gesticulated about the current target but noone said they'd try the better it.

My question is- would that even be possible? Without damaging infrastructure and halting production etc. It struck me as odd and a pipe dream.

However, I'm not well versed in this, so thought Id ask in the right place to help my understandingAn activist asked politicians in the UK to cut their target of 2050 to reduce greenhouse emissions to zero to 2025- is that really possible?"

Very interesting video talking about some of the advancements made in carbon-sequestering technology, with pros and cons of using carbon sequestration. The main concern is that it will prolong our dependence on oil and take away funds that could otherwise be used to establish renewable energy grids.   


Personally, I feel that in order to prevent or roll back some of the effects of climate change, we will need to use sequestration. I would also be curious if they are developing a system that can work to remove carbon out of the ocean, as the large amount of CO2 currently being held within it is disrupting the ocean's ecosystems world wide. However, I feel that a big contingency that will have to be established is that sequestered CO2 ***cannot*** be pulled out of the ground again or used by oil companies. I definitely agree with some of the comments in the video that suggest doing so is defeating the whole purpose of pulling carbon out of the air.

There is a ton of them out there that say they charge cell phones and other devices, some battery packs even have solar panels on them, but some of those battery packs for example clearly state that itll take a long time to properly charge by solar and indirectly say to just charge from your plug in and not bother with the panel. 

Id like to get a solar panel to leave in my car while im at work, and charge my phone on the way home. I have found some battery packs that have 5 solar panels to them, or a long panel that i can get the battery pack seperately. Would any of these actually do what i am looking for, or are the small solar panels still a gimick and not to bother unless im installing multiple ones on an rv?

1. Your community—picking up trash won’t stop climate change, but it will make your local park prettier, and people will appreciate it. Driving less won’t change the world, but your neighborhood will be cleaner.
2. Your health—eating less meat won’t singlehandedly stop the earth from getting warmer, but it will stop you from getting heart disease or diabetes.
3. Every drop in the ocean counts—you may even influence others.
4. Your wallet—using less resources means less money spent!

My question is why do many (and I mean a majority) of individuals who refer to themselves as environmental enthusiasts, conservationists, or who are constantly informing others on how to improve the health of the environment also happen to smoke weed yet not see the hypocrisy with it? 

I’m aware that there are tons of ways that someone hurts the environment everyday including eating meat, driving cars, using electricity, not recycling, etc., but many of these things are almost essential to everyday life. Eating meat is a whole different topic but to many meat can be the only affordable or opportunity they have. When it comes to weed (recreational), weed serves no essential role in a life yet it is pretty bad for the environment. 
- 1lb of weed produced is similar to ~ 2 metric tons of Co2 output 
- increases the use of fertilizers and pesticides in urban developments 
- uses an enormous amount of electricity
- ~ 1% of the US power emissions 
- and more 

This isn’t a Legal vs illegal argument, because making it legal is probably better for the environment anyways. But the main focus of my question is why do so many people, especially young people (50% of 18-25 year olds tend to use weed), argue to be environmentally conscious (where young people are more progressive than old) yet smoke weed every single day?

What are things average individuals can do about climate change? Shorter showers, recycling, not eating meat are all small things; bigger things include less driving and less flying, all things individuals could do to improve the environment.. but would that be enough..?
Do you think if every individual lived their normal lives better in regards to climate change (with some doing better than others), or is that not enough? Or does it require the system as a whole to change? 
It seems hard to predict exactly, but everything we do positively for the environment increases the probability of maintaining a comfortable (and healthy) climate.
I think one thing for sure is overpopulation. If our population was half of what it was right now we would be in better shape

Tldr: If individuals lived their normal lives, but with improvement (ie less energy used, less driving/flying), would it be enough, or do we need to change our system entirely to avoid climate change's negative effects on Earth (ie becoming more primitive so we lose less energy)?Ok, so what now?"

The Arctic is a huge part of our planet with an area of ​​over 21 million square kilometers, which includes the edges of the continents of Eurasia and North America, almost the entire Arctic Ocean with islands, as well as the adjacent parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In its depths, according to experts, a whole treasury of various natural resources is hidden. However, the active development of oil and gas fields in this region inevitably entails environmental problems, in particular, pollution of the Arctic waters, declining animal populations, climate change, etc. In addition, according to statistics provided by the environmental organization called Bellona, ​​during the development of The Arctic has accumulated more than 250 thousand barrels of oil, as well as about a million tons of scrap metal.

Today, a new stage in the development of the Russian Arctic is inextricably linked with one of the top priorities of modern Russia - cleaning the Arctic region from debris. Today this task is better done by the military, who are returning to the Arctic region and clearing the rubble of tons of scrap metal. So, for example, in 2018, the military personnel of the environmental unit of the Eastern Military District, using the new PP-250 baling presses, pressed more than 165 tons of empty metal barrels, and also collected and prepared about 630 tons of garbage for disposal. In addition, according to the district press service chief Colonel Alexander Gordeyev dated June 17, 2019, the servicemen of the environmental unit of the Eastern Military District began cleaning the Arctic island of Wrangel, in less than four months they will have to export about 150 tons of scrap metal.

Thus, Russia, despite the active development of the Arctic, is taking all the necessary measures to preserve the world's most fragile unique ecosystem. As the head of the A. I. Voeikov Geophysical Observatory, Vladimir Kattsov, said: “The Arctic is our home and we have to take care of it!”.The Arctic"

Climate Change is easily the greatest existential threat to civilization today. If you are not aware of its potential effects, a[ recent report by the Breakthrough Centre For Climate Restoration](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_b2c0c79dc4344b279bcf2365336ff23b.pdf) says that Civilization could end by 2050 if Climate Change continues at the rate we see today.

Arguments can be made for Nuclear War, Mass Migration, and other issues being the greatest threat to humanity.

But steps have been taken to address those threats- especially in the United States.

Unfortunately, Climate Change has hardly been addressed in the United States in the way it needs to be. The fact that[ 97% of actively publishing climate scientists](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) believe climate change is extremely likely to be due to human activities- and that we have[ a President who outright denies climate change](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940)\- proves that point.

What can we do? Let’s start out with the basics. 

The United States is a world leader, no matter your view on the current government administration. [As the 12th richest country in the world](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/richest-countries-in-the-world), the United States has the power to help create the needed change to prevent absolutely catastrophic global warming- but we will need a complete shift away from the current political, social, and economic structure we see in the United States (and the world) today. The solutions to Climate Change are already ready to be deployed. As young activist Greta Thunberg said, “People tell me I should study to become a climate scientist so I can solve the climate crisis. But the Climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions. All we have to do is wake up and change.” Greta is right. Studies have been done to show that [100% renewable energy in the United States is achievable by 2050](https://www.iflscience.com/environment/here-s-roundmap-get-us-run-100-renewable-energy-2050/). And frankly, we have no excuses, because other studies have shown [100% renewable energy around the WORLD ](https://physicsworld.com/a/a-global-100-renewable-energy-system/)is achievable by 2050. There are three sectors that I mentioned earlier that will be imperative in making lofty goals like these possible; economic, social, and political. Let’s go over them. 

Politically, lobbying is a huge problem, as[ Fossil Fuel giants pour money into the greedy mouths of corrupt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/03/25/oil-and-gas-giants-spend-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-infographic/#6442f5017c4f) politicians to halt climate change action that would greatly affect Fossil Fuel Giant's profits. First off, [lobbying](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/) from Corporations must be cut off from the government- and I mean the entirety of the Government, not just Presidential Campaigns.  Then, a complete switch of executive power in the United States to a President who supports a form of a Green New Deal to push the United States to a position where leading the world to a future of[ less than 2 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/global-warming-heat-related-deaths) is needed. Unless those measures are taken, a future that locks in to 3 degrees Celsius of Warming is likely- and[ that would be absolutely catastrophic.](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_campaign=Redirect) But why us, some of you may be asking? Why do we have to step up when we see movements starting all around the world to oppose man made Climate Change? It's a simple answer.[ The United States is a world leader in CO2 emissions](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/4/24/18512804/climate-change-united-states-china-emissions). And after ten years of decline in emissions levels from 2005 to 2015, United States emissions aren’t decreasing at the rate they need to be, and have either plateaued or increased. Without a full reaction to Climate Change in the United States, full efforts around the world would be much less effective as we continue to cloud our judgement with the haze of fossil fuels.

But again- where does the 2020 Presidential Election play into this? 

Look.[ Clearly, we can't rely on Congress](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++). Many of its members- and key ones, too- take payments from Big Oil and Fossil Fuel corporations that impede progress. Members of the Senate and House have been corrupted by these corporations,[ through lobbying](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-interests-have-outspent-environmental-advocates-101-on-climate-lobbying) and direct payments. It’s a shocking, sad reality- but money has taken priority over human lives and the future of our world as a whole. Also, AOC’s [‘Green New Deal’ didn’t even get through the Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-fails-advance-green-new-deal-democrats-protest-mcconnell-sham-n987506) (not that that was a surprise). What’s needed is the House and Senate to be in control of the Democratic Party- then clearly, a Green New Deal could be passed. As Robinson Meyer, a writer for The Atlantic who covers climate change stated, “Every additional Senate seat that Democrats take in 2020 could help them pass a Green New Deal. Sudden demographic change—such as a surge in enthusiasm among young voters—could push electoral math in Democrats’ direction.” [But that is far from a guarantee, even if it is possible](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/green-new-deal-why-democrats-will-struggle/581245/). With that in mind, a Democratic President who is willing to take Executive action to push Green policies into place would be needed. Why not just wait until 2024, though, if it isn’t likely pass a Green New Deal in 2020? If you’ve been paying attention, you know we are living on time we don’t have. Every day that passes digs us deeper into the climate grave we are burying ourselves in. [Any possible executive action](https://thebulletin.org/2019/03/what-could-happen-if-a-democratic-president-declared-a-national-climate-emergency/) against climate change if the Senate and House aren’t controlled by Democrats will have to be taken. It wouldn’t be pretty, but it’d be a necessary step. 

Socially, communities must understand that creating change to stop climate change doesn't come from driving an electric car, or going to the local Farmer's Market. Creating Change includes stepping up to buyback power grids from private companies that inhibit renewable energies- as we’ve seen [in Germany](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/political-breakthroughs-brighten-outlook-for-germanys-grid-expansion#gs.is6vp3) (although there have been problems- see the link). When the electricity grids are put in government control, all of a sudden the interests are put into what the people want, and not what the private shareholders want- which is obviously more money. This is happening here in the States, not just Germany- [take Boulder, Colorado as an example](https://www.dailycamera.com/2019/04/18/boulder-makes-68-5m-offer-to-acquire-xcel-energy-assets-as-it-works-toward-municipal-utility/). However, only one state in the United States has a completely publicly owned electricity sector. That state is Nebraska, where there are lower electricity rates than the national average. A greater push is needed to promote renewable energy in cities across the United States. People must decide whether climate action is important enough to them to vote in government officials who will create change- and if they do, they must go out and vote in that way! Those same people must also take part in stepping out of the fundamental free market property known as mass consumerism. I’ll let this quote from The New Republic explain it for you. 

“C40 Cities, a network of 94 of the world’s biggest cities, released a report on Wednesday estimating how much consumption habits drive the climate crisis. The results were staggering: In those nearly 100 cities, where a combined 700 million live, the consumption of goods and services “including food, clothing, aviation, electronics, construction and vehicles” is responsible for 10 percent of global greenhouse gases. That’s nearly double the emissions from every building in the entire world.”

If you connect the dots, it’s easy to tell that a much more conservative, get-what-you-need lifestyle is a necessary part to implement into every day society if we are to slow climate change at the rate it needs to be slowed. So how does that relate to the 2020 election? Well, it’s pretty easy to tell that simply asking people to travel less and consume less won’t work. People need to elect in officials that will put policies in place to create the needed lifestyle. There must be a total infrastructure redevelopment in order to make this work. That includes greatly pushing public transit, reducing urban sprawl tenfold, increasing clean water supplies, and reducing food deserts so low income and lower class people can access the resources they need. Those lower income people also need to have less financial stress too- which we could see come into play through nationwide healthcare and a flexible living wage that would be different state to state depending on what an accurate living wage is in a given state. You see, the 2020 election is going to light a path that all of our futures will take. That’s especially true for the lower class that I’ve mentioned. They are the ones who will be most greatly affected by Climate Change, and ironically, they are the least responsible for Climate Change. Those with high amounts of wealth are the ones who most directly cause Climate Change, through travel and mass consumption, among other things. That’s why political austerity and tax slashes for the rich literally need to be reversed- taxes need to be placed on the rich in order to improve life for those who are least responsible for climate change but will be most greatly affected by Climate Change. Once that is achieved, the stages of a Green New Deal can be put in place to curb climate emissions and create new jobs. That includes massive investments in building public transit, creating city wide composting systems, building more affordable housing, redesigning city layouts to be more compact, and many more options that will [create millions of jobs](https://www.sierraclub.org/trade/what-green-new-deal). This all connects back to 2020 because literally none of this can happen without communities coming out to vote for the candidates that will make this all possible. The social revolution that I have outlined can and will happen- but it all banks on you and 2020. 

Every person reading this and every person in the United States has a voice. But who’s voice is louder; the people’s, or the green bills in their pockets? Economically, money has the loudest voice in our current state. What is that current state, you may ask? Unfettered Capitalism. Around the world, free trade agreements, corporations, and political corruption influence our green future and our present society the most. Corporations and Fossil Fuel Companies are allowed to spread over the world and pump emissions into the atmosphere at catastrophic rates- a [2017 Guardian ](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change)article said that 71% of global emissions are caused by roughly 100 companies. Of those companies, fossil fuels are the worst- “ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron are identified as among the highest emitting investor-owned companies since 1988.” If those companies are allowed to run rampant all over the world, drilling oil and making billions while guaranteeing the deaths of millions, than we have slammed the door on our already closing coffin. But if a step away from unfettered capitalism is made towards a more government regulated business sector that removes the ability of corporations to lobby and places strict environmental restrictions on those corporations, then there is hope. Free trade agreements also greatly inhibit efforts to stop climate change, and they must be restructured in order to save the planet. Naomi Klein, author of ‘This Changes Everything (:) Capitalism vs The Climate’ stated, “As the free trade system was put in place and producing offshore became the rule, emissions did more than move- they multiplied.” Trade agreements are severely lacking in environmental regulations- and the Behemoth of trade agreements, the WTO, is the worst of them all. [Their website even says the following](https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/bey2_e.htm): “The WTO has no specific agreement dealing with the environment.”  They even go further to say, “...the removal of trade restrictions and distortions can yield benefits both for the multilateral trading system and the environment.” These are just two among many environmental hypocrisies you can find on their site that I linked in above. [Green protectionism](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/envir_e/envir_req_e.htm) is a particularly fun one that inhibits local renewable energy efforts. Clearly, that’s barely brushing the surface but I do believe you see the point I’m trying to make; Unfettered Capitalism must be stopped in order to save our planet. The 2020 Election is the time for us to step up and vote in a leader who will see these problems and make the needed moves. 

All of these changes are possible! That much is clear. 

Yet here we are,[ pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/06/01/one-year-since-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-paris-climate-agreement/) (Which isn't enough, by the way) and[ pushing billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry through government subsidies.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/30/america-spends-over-20bn-per-year-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-abolish-them)

It's clear that the Trump administration isn't going to do anything to stop Climate Change- as I've helped illustrate, they encourage it. So when 2020 rolls around, GO VOTE. Vote for our future, and vote for our planet. I’ll never force on you who to vote for- but I’ll tell you one thing. The candidate I want to win? He’s not favored to win because of ‘electability’. :).

First off,  I am not  sure many Americans would be too concerned with.  Especially if this is  50+ years away.  That is not a judgement of Americans, but there are so  many challenges right now that are arguably larger in size that they  can directly map themselves to.

Second, I really feel this  article is counterproductive on some level.  After all, we were just  told two weeks ago that we only have 12 years to save humanity.  With  some articles literally calling for the end of humanity by 2050.  So,  how do these numbers track to those, and if they don't why are we  surprised when those we are trying to engage are less than engaging.

Given  this is our daily truth, and we are trying to engage as many people as  possible, I'd really enjoy hearing from the group about how and what we  need to do better if our goal really is to better engage and catalyze  change.Is ""Thousands of Americans are GOING TO DIE!!"" the right message to catalyze/ mobilize against climate change?

&gt;For more than two thousand years, windmills were built from recyclable or reusable materials: wood, stone, brick, canvas, metal. When – electricity producing – wind turbines appeared in the 1880s, the materials didn’t change.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s only since the arrival of plastic composite blades in the 1980s that wind power has become the source of a toxic waste product that ends up in landfills.  
&gt;  
&gt;New wood production technology and design makes it possible to build larger wind turbines almost entirely out of wood again – not just the blades, but also the rest of the structure. This would solve the waste issue and make the manufacturing of wind turbines largely independent of fossil fuels and mined materials. A forest planted in between the wind turbines could provide the wood for the next generation of wind turbines.How to Make Wind Power Sustainable Again"

Ever since I read [this](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm)  1996 New York Times article called “Recycling Is Garbage,” I’ve known  that government recycling of plastic, paper, and glass wastes more  resources than it saves, and that the environment would actually be  better off if we put these things into landfills instead of recycling  them.

Over the next [1,000 years](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm),  all of the garbage in the entire United States could fit into one  landfill that was 100 yards deep, on a piece of square land which was  just 35 miles on each side. Today’s modern landfills are [well sealed](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm), and when they are full, they get turned into [parks](http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm). I live in Pennsylvania, which is the United State’s #1 garbage importing state. We keep approving [new landfills](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-02-19/news/0202190037_1_landfill-garbage-pennsylvania-rules), because we love the jobs and tax revenue that it gives us.

Well now we have [this](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/17/recycled-plastic-america-global-crisis)  brand new article from the Guardian, which shows that our recycling  hurts the environment even more than I had thought. It says that a lot  of the plastic that we put into recycling bins gets sent to poor  countries in Asia. Much of this plastic cannot actually be recycled,  either because it’s contaminated with food debris, or it’s the wrong  kind of plastic. These poor Asian countries mismanage much of their  garbage, and much of this plastic ends up in the ocean. [This](https://nypost.com/2017/12/12/10-rivers-are-responsible-for-90-of-the-plastic-in-the-ocean/)  other article, from the New York Post, says that 90% of the plastic in  the ocean comes from 10 rivers, eight of which are in Asia, and two of  which are in Africa. So much of the plastic that we recycle actually  ends up in the ocean.

If the goal is to virtue signal, then by all means, we should  continue to recycle our garbage. But if the goal is to protect the  environment, we should put it into landfills.Recycling uses more resources than it saves. A lot of recycled plastic actually ends up in the ocean. The environment would be better off it we stopped recycling, and put our trash into landfills."
0,"So far we have around 300 signatures ourselves and with the help of friends, and the org we're working with is collecting thousands more to present to our city council early July. Because of our efforts, my friend was interviewed on local news and has been contacted by a local plastic bag manufacturer to come in for a tour in a few days. I've researched the company, and they claim (credibly) that they recycle nearly all plastic waster on-site, and that all their plastics are recyclable. They also have a long record of volunteering and recycling efforts, which makes us believe that this company is one we could try to use as a model.

What we're less sure about is what we should try to learn from them, and what to say to them while we're there. We want to eliminate all plastic bags in our community, thus eliminating most need for them to be recycled (because most people don't/can't), but we think they'll try to convince us that it's possible to recycle all of them and that a ban isn't necessary.

0,"Cairo recycles a greater percentage of its garbage than any other city in the world. How do they do it (and why Cairo?)? I spent two weeks living the Cairo’s garbage collectors while filming a series on Egypt for PBS. They are so efficient that they don’t even charge people to pick up their garbage – they make all of their money from recycling it. A few interesting details: All of Cairo’s garbage collectors are Coptic Christians in a country that’s 80% Muslim. Individual families sort specific types of garbage. The garbage is separated into unbelievably specific piles (not just plastic soda bottles, but AMERICAN plastic soda bottles. The most valuable piece of garbage are 5 gallon oil cans. 

My video is in two parts. [Part 1](https://youtu.be/phpDOvkEZZk) is about how they collect and sort the garbage. [Part 2](https://youtu.be/Zy4sj4ggpSY) covers all the different ways they recycle and details of their lives in Garbage City.

0,"During April and May approximately 500 to 1000 metric tons of chemical waste was spilled in 20 places, mostly onto rural dirt roads, on the side of wheat fields or in a ditch next to dirt roads. 
This fact was made public at the end of May, the delay was so that the police could catch the truck driver. They did, he's under arrest. The preliminary analysis of the VVD (Our EPA) stated that the pollutant is possibly ketazine a byproduct of POROFOR (AZODICARBONAMIDE) manufacturing.

Here are some videos of the spill:
The videos contain the info I have laid out here.
https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTavarsEdgars%2Fvideos%2F2215514648544196%2F

Map of the spills:
http://www.vvd.gov.lv/public/fs/CKFinderJava/images/bilde%20Evita%20gatava.png

The pollutant is brownish and when evaporates makes brownish crystals. During these past two months it has evaporated or seeped into the ground leaving scorched dead plants and small animals. The VVD say that this stuff is a localized pollution that does not affect the groundwater or anything else and most of it must have ""harmlessly evaporated"". No cleanup has been made and there was only a plea from the gov. VVD to the alleged polluting factory to clean it up. At first they had no comment then they started to deny everything. Considering that they are the ONLY factory with ketazine as byproduct in this country and possibly the neighboring too, it may be pretty obvious who's the guilty one. 
These are the ""alleged"" polluters and their production portfolio. 
http://www.biolar.lv/en/products.html

Our VVD ir understaffed and underpaid (what a shocker) and possibly corrupt. Tomorrow is the press conference fortunately with lab results determining exactly which chemical it is and I'm planing on attending it and asking some tough questions, with your help of course.
So if you could chime in with your expertise on some of the official version.

1) Is ketazine really a waste product and not something that has value or application?

2) Is ketazine a byproduct of POROFOR (AZODICARBONAMIDE) manufacturing?

3) How cancerous/dangerous is it?

4) What cleanup should have been made?

5) What measurements and controls should be done to check soil, groundwater.

6) This is in EU, which agency has cleanup guidelines or to whom can we complain.

7) How to get the polluter by the balls.

8) Any other subreddit/forum that may help. This subreddit seemed very active so I posted here.

TL;DR;
Deliberate ketazine spill. How dangerous is this? Cleanup guidelines.

It would mean a lot if You could answer any of these questions or point to the right direction. Thanks.Deliberate ketazine spill. ~1000 tons. How dangerous is this?"

If you donate money to a specific event/campaign, when your money is used, you are sent back photo or video evidence of exactly how it was put to work. You can also choose to donate your skills like web dev or graphic design; or just helping physically by being an extra pair of hands.

0,"I've spent a lot of my time as a 20 something-year-old terrified of my future, like most people my age. Every day we go onto the internet and see another article about Donald Trump creating some mess that could cause nuclear war or worsening climate change. We see corporations and other countries hiding their effects on the environment and continuing their same practices of destroying the planet. Like many other people my age, we have started to plan not to have kids, because we figure we may all die within the next hundred years. Even worse is the way media portrays our future to us as only death and destruction. We are terrified to get up in the morning because we think what the point is? What's the point of going to school, having jobs, starting families if we will all be gone soon? I have seen some many 20-year-olds panic and become depressed because they feel too helpless. All we are taught by the people we interact, and the media is that it is helpless. 

I am done being afraid. Stop telling us that we are destined to die. Stop telling us that voting won't matter. Stop telling us that planting more trees or recycling more won't do anything. Stop. Seriously. Start telling us how to live and how we can help. Show us articles of positive change. Show us a positive progression. Show us what we can do to help. Most of us don't deny climate change, we just need to know how we can improve and that there is hope. If you keep telling us there is no hope and nothing can be done, we will panic and do nothing. Once the teenagers and 20-year-olds begin to believe they can do nothing, that's when we are really in trouble.

Hello everyone!

I'm a game designer working on an educational video game called [BioStories](https://www.biostoriesthegame.com/). This project started at the demand of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Secretariat (SCBD) in Montreal, which is a branch of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).

Our goal is to raise awareness around key biodiversity issues, especially among children and teenagers.

The game will be divided into separate chapters, each set in a different region of the world and tackling a different challenge. Chapter 1 is about the rhino poaching crisis that Africa is going through.

&amp;#x200B;

![video](1sao9hgrft331)

Players will play as a newly arrived ranger and will go through a series of missions where they will have to investigate crime scenes. Each mission is based off real-life cases to be as instructive as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The game will be free to play and available on mobile devices.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this type of media to engage the youth?

For the people working in biodiversity conservation, would you be interested to have this type of education tool for your own specialty?

We're trying to build a community around this project and would love to hear your feedback!

Thanks for reading :)BioStories - Educational Video Game about the Environment - Chapter 1 about Rhino Poaching"

\*\*Description\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

""Solastalgia is the pain experienced when there is recognition that the place where one resides and that one loves is under immediate assault. It is manifest in an attack on one’s sense of place, in the erosion of the sense of belonging to a particular place and a feeling of distress about its transformation."" - Glenn Albrecht

&amp;#x200B;

The everyday intimacy of climate change often goes under-acknowledged. This short film explores the dislocation, grief, and longing we all feel from the changes happening to our shared home. Can we find healing in acknowledging and accepting the sorrow and pain we are experiencing?

&amp;#x200B;

This film is also an exploration of the brighter side of climate change, both as a lived experience and as an invitation to a better path forward. Can we find solace and a better future by once again expressing deep respect and appreciation for our living planet that gives us all life?

It goes without saying – many of us adore morning coffee, be it latte, espresso, flat white or cappuccino. Some have it in a reusable cup at home while the vast majority of others will opt for a disposable option of their morning coffee as a handy way before work. But how many of us have asked ourselves a question “Are paper cups recyclable?” They are not. The most common type used for takeaway drinks cannot be recycled due to its plastic lining that prevents the paper cup from becoming saturated and falling apart. In fact, it will take about 30 years for the plastic lining to break up into fragments and around 100 years to break down entirely, but that’s only if the plastic has the perfect environmental conditions to do so. Unfortunately, right now only about 1% of disposable cups are recycled. The thing is, this plastic lining must be separated from the paper in the recycling process which makes recycling them difficult and costly. Most recycling centers are not even equipped to process them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leading a team of students attempting to build a free and open source app (and potentially other software products) that can help consumers not only make more eco friendly decisions, but also help them hold companies responsible for the impact they have on the environment, as a lot of emissions are produced on the manufacturing and industrial side of things, rather than things that consumers have a direct effect on. We are currently planning to use ESG (environmental, social, governance) scores to rank companies within product categories, but ESG data has several limitations, such as being voluntarily report by companies and internally monitored. So we'd love to hear more ideas about what information could either help people make better decisions, or help them hold companies responsible. 

&amp;#x200B;

And if you'd like to volunteer to help on the project, send me a message. Look forward to hearing from you!

0,"Our bones are withering away at a very, very fast pace. Children’s skeletons are becoming more and more fragile EVERY year. On a decadal scale. This is frightening. Bones are synonymous with infrastructure because we would literally collapse without them.

Our jaws are becoming so tiny that crooked teeth are a feature, not an aberration. Some believe our tiny mandibles changed our language, and allowed a 3-fold increase in the use of ""F"" and ""V"" sounds over time. This is why we can now easily say ""Fuck Vox!"".

Our smartphones are already changing the shape of our skulls and causing a spikey protuberance in the back near our necks. This is due to something called, ""text neck"". Our new slouching postures are straining the muscles attached to the base of our skulls – and the body responds by laying down fresh layers of bone. This use to be rare – not any more.

When we compare the height of a person to the width of a single elbow, we can see that human elbows are getting thinner. They are literally withering away.

Children do not play outside anymore – they play video games and stare at toxic photon devices. These devices are damaging the brain's visual cortex and causing endemic myopia. They also cause physical and mental illness.

The chemicals, plastics and metals that make our devices contribute to the biological emasculation, feminization and sterilization of all male vertebrates. While I think our acceptance of biological sexual deviance is ultimately good, it does not bode well for the terrible future we face because we are mentally, physically and sexually weaker.

0,"I have a real issue with things being so divisive when perhaps they are the victim of mass hysteria.

Plastic. Scourge of our time. Evil product that will destroy the world. Killer of the oceans, clogging the world in general.

But is it plastic that is evil, or the inability of man to manage it properly?

You will never be able to live without it. It protects you in hospital, allows energy and water to enter your homes (remember lead water pipes?) there are numerous good ways that it benefits mankind.

The problem should not be the banning of plastic, but to educate people to embrace and use it correctly, to dispose of it correctly, and for science to find ways to dispose of it properly that encourages governments and people to follow proper rules.

Just think, if you banned plastic, say for wrapping, then perhaps paper would be used and cause even more destruction of forests.

But I'm open to arguments.Is plastic so bad?"
0,"today while sitting in a meeting we were given some permanent markers. As I was bored I started drawing with it (even though i suck at it), and at some point i had an idea and drew a whale on my t-shirt. Then I felt sad about whales and wrote RIP under it. And it got me thinking.. I already have some ideas to draw on my shirts, like a bee with text ""you need me"" or something, another is a crossed out AC with ""id rather sweat than starve"", etc.

Buying new clothes for this is not an option, since usually I don't buy clothing (some pants when the current ones become unwearable), and try to minimize unnecessary consumption.

The point is I want to draw pro-environment propaganda on my cloths but I suck at drawing, so I thought asking if anybody knows some such existing pictures. Also, what do you think? If the media doesn't give the necessary coverage... It being hand-drawn might make it a good conversation starter as well.I've had an idea from a boring meeting today"

0,"Canada is going to ban all single use plastics in 2021, they will soon be on their way to a greener society. Is this enough? Can Canada move as fast as Rwanda. 

Rwanda has achieved great things can Canada get in line with them as well. 

Canada has already gotten so far in terms of reconciliation and saving the ecosystems. In some ways even more than Rwanda, but Rwanda is gaining speed–more and more, since the year 2000 when Kagame was put in charge.

Rwanda is gaining on Canada in these terms. Can Canada look at Rwanda for help/influence? Yes we can. This is a message that could be used all around the world. Remember, only 5 years until the point of no return–when our home disappears for good.It's been 25 years since the end of the Rwandan Genocide. Since then, the president: Paul Kagame has helped the country so much–in terms of reconciliation and environmentalism. The plastic bag ban is something amazing that they have done. How much influence does it have?"

0,"Hi everyone 😁 I've been working in the commercial fishing industry for 15 years the  work is seasonal and in the off seasons I build ""Turtle excluding devices"" (T.E.D'S)  I work all over Australia and even shrimped in Florida for a bit.

A very brief history,in the old days nobody cared about the non target species we caught and discarded.

American government wants to save manatees invents TED's 

TED's exclude big creatures but also lots of shrimp

American fisherman get shitty they can't meet domestic demands and imports from the land down under increase

American government tells Aussies ""oi get fucked cunt if you wanna sell your prawns here you need to use TED's 

Aussie dollar was hovering around half a USD at the time and fisherman would kick a baby in the face if the US told them to

Aussies reply ""yeah mate no worries send us blueprints we'll put em in tomorrow""

MURICAAAAAAA!!!! FUCK YEAH!!!! says ""get fucked cunt nobody makes shit as good as us we will send you ones we made by scientists and shit""

Aussies get the Ted's realise how fucked they are catches reduced by 80% 

Random Aussies work day and night making small adjustments to try to make a living

Impossible

2 Aussies redesigns the TED's 1 fisherman and 1 netmaker 

Aussies tell the US ""hey we made these better they barely affect the target species and exclude all larger sea life here's an underwater video me made showing it in action can we use these instead""

Embarrassed USA scientists reply ""hey you recorded video underwater?...wish I thought of that we wind these Ted's acceptable please send blueprints""

Dumb cunts send blueprints and miss a golden opportunity to make MURICAAAAAAA buy them from the land down under

Ok now that you know the history here's where I come in I've worked directly for both of the men who redesigned the TED's I saw the netmaker every single day and worked side by side with him for 3 months a year and I lived and worked with the fisherman 24/7 for 4 months straight

TED' s work in a way but in some ways they don't either by poor installation or deliberate tampering by fisherman and also there is a government legislation loophole that is exploited by every single operator

I can't blow the whistle myself because hellooooo unemployment/it's easy to murder someone at sea and feed the Sharks so pay me using PayPal and I'll spill the beans and provide a specific example of  Raptis the largest Aussie prawn trawler company knowingly gaming the system and give you contact details of 2 witnesses who will gladly testify against the general managers own brother.

Price 
$70 gets you an explanation of the loophole and I will tell you few Common ways skippers alter the devices and don't get caught and how the people who inspect the equipment don't know what they are doing
$250 gets you the example and the contact details of the witnesses and I'll source as many pics of people doing the wrong thing as possible **killing protected species for trophies n shit**

The $70 option if fulfilled will be posted here for all to see the $250 would be by DM email or phone call there's a lot of info and I assume you will have a lot of questions

So that's it anything else you would be willing to pay for from an insider? Pollution? Unsafe work practices? Psychological torture?Bribe me to help you save endangered sea turtles."

0,"Hi,

I'm leading a team of students attempting to build a free and open source app (and potentially other software products) that can help consumers not only make more eco friendly decisions, but also help them hold companies responsible for the impact they have on the environment, as a lot of emissions are produced on the manufacturing and industrial side of things, rather than things that consumers have a direct effect on. We are currently planning to use ESG (environmental, social, governance) scores to rank companies within product categories, but ESG data has several limitations, such as being voluntarily report by companies and internally monitored. So we'd love to hear more ideas about what information could either help people make better decisions, or help them hold companies responsible.

And if you'd like to volunteer to help on the project (we are especially looking for an architect), send me a message. Look forward to hearing from you!

0,"Good Afternoon r/environment!  


My name is Zach Champ and I am a fellow conservationist, environmentalist, and writer/editor for **American Gypsy Herbalist (** [https://www.americangypsyherbalist.com/](https://www.americangypsyherbalist.com/) )**.** 

https://i.redd.it/qvjofjcpdr231.png

I wanted to share an article I wrote recently that I think discusses an important concept. When we talk about Environmentalism and protecting ecosystems I think the discussion often misses a crucial point which is individual attitudes towards land ownership. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way we perceive the land we own, manage, and have access to determines ultimately our interactions with it. One of the things I am a huge proponent of as an environmentalist and conservationist is the idea that **LAND IS SACRED**. This is partially why I created the brand American Gypsy Herbalist which bridges topics related to Herbal Medicine, nature, conservation, and spiritualism. To me, all these topics are interdependent and interrelated! 

&amp;#x200B;

If people understood that the land we inhabit was sacred, then maybe we would be more conscious in our actions relating to the land. I wrote this article on **LAND STEWARDSHIP** which I think is an important Conservation Ethic. I want to spread awareness and understanding of this concept so people can apply this Ethic to their own Land ownership and management practices whether they are regular homeowners in the suburbs with a humble plot of land or if they are owners of significant acreage in the country! 

https://i.redd.it/4bccbycmdr231.jpg

**Here is an excerpt from the article:**   


""It is important to realize that when you own land you own more than just a house and a yard- you own a part of the environment, especially if you own significant acreage. It is important that landowners realize the importance of private land holdings as being integrated and connected with the ecosystem- even if they are not near a park or a forest. All land is connected to the local ecosystems and ultimately in one large biosphere. Therefore it is important for landowners to realize this and to have a concept of land stewardship.

**What is land stewardship?** Land stewardship is a belief and methodology that at its core is about responsible and productive ownership of land. If you own land, you have a *responsibility* to maintain the natural setting. You also have the right to make productive use of your land. A good land steward knows how to make continued sustainable use of their land while keeping its character and essence in place for future generations to inherit and appreciate. A good land steward recognizes that it is okay to cut trees for timber from a forest on their property, but they would never *clear-cut* the forest in its entirety. It is through good land stewardship that we as landowners can maintain native eco-systems, encourage wildlife habitation on our properties, and profit from nature’s rewards!""

&amp;#x200B;

***What do you all think? Have you heard of Land Stewardship before?*** 

***Do these attitudes and beliefs shape how you handle the ownership and management of YOUR property?***

0,"I used to believe that climate change/global warming is known by everyone and is accepted as a fact. But today as I was speaking to my mother about how the world might potentially end in 2030, she laughed and dismissed it. She said that it wouldn’t happen, and when I tried to further explain the situation, she told me that even if the world did end it was God’s will. Honestly that part blew my mind, how could she said that all these are all part of God’s plan. Humans have the power to stop it.
After that I told my friends about it— I initially thought that they would have the same views as me. But no. She told me the same thing as my mother, that it was God’s choice if he wanted people to die. Another one of my friend told me that it’s inevitable. That people would not try to save the earth, and it’s not possible to change the situation.

0,"I love our planet, as I’m sure everyone else does. But I’m sick of all these people who claim they love the environment, going to all the environmental protests ( I’m from England, and the past few months there were lots of protests disrupting all our roads from the Generation X people). Anyway , I respect that and the fact they are trying to give recognition to global warming and all the environmental issues. But practice what you preach. Unless you are vegan, I don’t wanna here rubbish about the fact you love the environment. Because 1) that means loving animals and 2) eating no meat or dairy is the SINGLE BIGGEST WAY an individual can reduce their carbon impact and damage to the environment. 
This isn’t a vegan rant (I’m not vegan), more a rant at those who are ‘planet savers’ but hypocritically also stuff themselves on sausage sarnies and Nando’s (UK chicken restaurant).
Also I’m sure most serious environmentalists are vegans. This is directed at the proportion of individuals who claim they are but in reality are not. I know that no one can have no carbon footprint and of course everyone will make contributions to the detriment of the environment, but it is literally so easy to partially save the planet by just not eating meat.Non-vegan environmentalists should rethink their morals"

Seagulls chirped overhead as my son Cole and I walked down the old wooden pier. Men on either sides of us cast their lines and nets out in hopes of catching their dinner. One man pulls his net up and empties out the candy wrappers that had been caught in it onto the pier. He reaches down and picks up the slimy, faded orange wrapper of a Reese’s. A visible look of disgust on his face as he tosses it into one of the many nearby trash cans. Another man reels in his line to find a plastic bag caught by his hooks. He begins to tear apart the bag and throws it away. 

“Catching much today?” I say as I walk up behind Justin, one of the usuals on the pier. 

“The usual. A few bluefish, a crab in one of the traps, and a couple pounds of plastic.” He replied as he tied a knot around a new hook. “Currents heading out so not as much trash been washing up today.”

“Just heading further out” I replied in a somewhat defeated tone. 

We set up our coolers and tackle boxes a few feet away from Justin. I baited a few of Cole’s hooks and he threw them a couple meters pur from the pier. As I baited mine a seagull swooped just past us and into the water, grabbing what looked like a bread tie from the surface of the water. I tried to not think about it as I threw in my lure and began to retrieve it. It didn’t take long for me to snag a bag. I pulled it up revealing it to be an old Target bag. It’s faded colors telling me it must’ve been in there for some time before I snagged it. 

I walked over to one of the many bins labeled “Bags” and shoved it inside. As I walked bag I noticed Cole reeling in what appear to be a fish. I was startled that he had hooked one so fast and ran over to see if he needed help. By the time I got there though he had already pulled up the line. A bag had been snagged on the hook covering the fish but was easy to get off. Underneath it was a little pinfish not more than 5 inches. The bag had made it seem like a monster while he was reeling it in. It didn’t matter to him though as his eyes were lit up with excitement. He asked to hold it nervously as I took it off the hook. I agreed and pulled out my phone to take a picture. Just as I took the picture a gust of wind blew the bag back into the ocean. I walked over to the edge of the pier and watched as it drifted out to sea. 

“It’s okay daddy.” I heard from behind me. “I’ll catch it again one day.” I turned around and watched as he gently put the little fish back into the water. The murky green water absorbing the fishes silhouette in seconds. We continued to fish with little more luck besides the usual plastic. For us, it was a good day. Not so often you catch a fish in this world.A Fishing Trip in 2050"

0,"First off—hello Reddit!  After years of lurking I've been inspired to make an account, join the community and take personal action after reading the recent news about the recycling industry.  That said, I wasn't quite sure where to post this question—please direct me elsewhere if need be!  Otherwise, let's continue...

Recently I learned something surprising about my city of Gainesville—we don't recycle certain types of plastic!  In particular, I've been throwing plastic Starbucks cups into the recycling for years, and it turns out someone's been spending their valuable time separating them back out.

I never looked up my local recycling rules.  I know most of my friends haven't either.  And so when we recycle Starbucks cups they become wishcycling.  Wishcycling (where well-meaning individuals try to recycle items that aren't recyclable) is a much larger and more systemic issue that makes recycling more difficult, more expensive and potentially not economically feasible.  

Would you use an app that reads your location and helps you easily determine whether a bottle you want to get rid of is recyclable in your current city?  And if so, do you think that widespread use of such an app would help the recycling industry as a whole?

There are broader implications for this too.  If people are willing, the app could collect images of recyclables and data that can be fed into a machine learning algorithm—one that may someday be able to identify recyclables itself and further optimize the recycling collection process.  

So.  Worthwhile idea?  Needs tweaks?  Let me know your thoughts!  And check back if this interests you because if people are interested enough for me to start developing something then I'll chronicle my progress somewhere you can follow along.  Thank you Reddit!

TL;DR do you like the idea of an app that determines whether something's recyclable for you?Would you use an app that helps you stop ""wishcycling?"" Do you think such an effort would help solve the bigger problems recycling faces?"

### The greatest conservation success story in the 21st century is the exponential growth of protected areas–a primary defense mechanism against Earth’s biodiversity loss. In 1992, world nations signed an [agreement](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/international/cbd/index_en.htm) to create protected areas on the land and sea to preserve our nature and prevent biodiversity loss.  The numbers say we did it. With the efforts of more than 160 countries, 15% of Earth’s surface is now declared as protected.

0,"12.3 million. The number of homes solar panels were able to power in the US at the end of 2018. Whenever conferring with others about the energy source of the future, solar energy is almost always brought alight. Solar energy is rapidly expanding around the world, as the push for clean energy spreads across the globe. Behind solar energy are solar panels: the panels that absorb sunlight as a source of energy to create electricity for our needs. Ever since 1839, solar panels have been changing constantly and improving greatly to better coincide with the push for 100% clean, renewable energy. The talk around solar panels for the future of the world is undeniably a great amount, but it is also important to acknowledge the history of solar panels, how they work, and their current day status. 
 
Solar energy has been around ever since ancient civilization, but it wasn’t anything like the conventional solar panels seen today used to harness the sun’s energy. It wasn’t until the 1800s when the ball got rolling and solar energy was starting to form like a newly born star in the solar system. Solar energy all started based off an earth-shattering 1839 discovery found by French physicist, Edmond Becquerel. This discovery consisted of the finding of the photovoltaic effect, “a process that generates voltage or electric current in a photovoltaic cell when it is exposed to sunlight,” as Energy Education puts it. Additionally, the discovery of the photovoltaic effect was found while Becquerel was conducting research with a cell comprised of metal electrodes in a conducting solution. Consequently, Becquerel would exclaim, “shining light on an electrode submerged in a conductive solution would create an electric current,” in reference to discovering the photovoltaic effect. Later, in 1873, Willoughby Smith stumbled upon the photoconductivity of selenium, now used in solar panels today. Moreover, in 1876, William Grylls Adams and Richard Evans Day put the photovoltaic idea (originally found by Becquerel) to selenium, finding it could generate electricity when light hit it. To no one’s surprise, someone would eventually put all three discoveries to life which is exactly what happened in 1883, when Charles Fritts created the first ever working selenium cell. Charles Fritts’ newly made cell was an ingenious invention at the time, as he hoped it would compete with Edison’s coal-fired power plants. On the contrary, the new, innovative selenium cell was less than 1% efficient and had no chance of competing with Edison’s coal-fired power plants as the solar cell wasn’t a feasible way of powering millions of peoples lives. Generally, the idea of solar energy wasn’t a popular one at the time and wouldn’t be for a while. Eventually, the concept of solar energy was brought alight when Albert Einstein published a paper on the photoelectric effect and how light carries energy, happening in 1905. Hence, Albert Einstein would win The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921, “For his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.” He would receive the prize a year later, in 1922.
 
 With the concept of solar energy gaining steam, more specifically the photoelectric and photovoltaic effect, it wasn’t until 1941 when Russell Ohl broke the barrier and invented the solar cell; different than the selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts in 1883. Similarly, like Fritts’ selenium cell, the new solar cell invented by Russell Ohl was incredibly ineffective and not a feasible option to power the lives of many at the time. The energy conversion efficiency of the cell was only 1%, thus for every 100 Joules of solar energy hitting the cell, only 1 Joule of electrical energy was created. While this was an improvement from Fritts’ cell, it wasn’t enough to be used as a legitimate source of energy worldwide, as previously mentioned. The most groundbreaking, substantial invention didn’t come until 1954, when the modern day photovoltaic cell was invented by Daryl Chapin, Calvin Fuller, and Gerald Pearson. After months of long, grueling work, the final product was the first feasible silicon cell ever invented. Originally, Daryl Chapin wanted to make a source of power for telephone systems in remote areas, therefore turning to solar energy as the option. He would later collaborate with Calvin Fuller and Gerald Pearson, as they all invented the cell in unity. Truly, this was the cell of the future as the newly invented cell had a 6% conversion efficiency, much more than the 1941 solar cell invented by Russell Ohl or the 1883 selenium cell invented by Charles Fritts. In fact, the solar call had so much potential The New York Times wrote the newly invented silicon cell, “may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams–the harnessing of the almost limitless energy of the sun for the uses of civilization.” Even though the cell was way too costly at the time to be used by the public or companies (the solar cells costed over $100 per watt), the US military decided to fund research on the cells for the potential to power satellites in the 1950s. The funding persited, and the first ever spacecraft to use solar panels ended up being the Vanguard I in 1958. For some time, solar was still too costly for use until Dr. Elliot Berman did extensive research and was able to produce a much less expensive solar cell, bringing the cost per watt down to just $20, in the early 1970s. Coincidentally, in 1973, the energy crisis hit the US which made oil prices skyrocket forcing the US to turn to other energy options, like solar. In turn, this made the US government committed to developing solar energy (solar panels in specific) as a feasible source of energy for future uses. As a result, Jimmy Carter decided to install solar panels on the roof of the White House to spread awareness and to make a solar energy statement. Evidently, solar panels started to become more feasible as the “golden era” of solar panels for the 1900s hit in the 1980s. 
 
During the 1980s, solar panels started to become much more efficient and cheaper through research and developments. By the 1990s, many groundbreaking creations came out which helped fuel solar panel growth. For example, in 1992, the University of South Florida developed a 15.9% efficient thin-film photovoltaic cell made of cadmium telluride. Just a short time after, in 1994, the first ever solar cell exceeding 30% conversion efficiency was made. 5 years later, in 1999, a photovoltaic solar cell was developed that converted 32.3% of the sunlight that hits it into electricity. Also in 1999,  the new efficiency record for photovoltaic thin-film solar cells was hit marking in at 18.8%. In total, growth between the 1980s and 1990s was crucial to solar panels expanding. Just in 1983, the worldwide photovoltaic production was 21.3 megawatts. In 1999, that number increased to 1,000 megawatts. In conclusion, it is clear the history of solar panels was jammed packed and certainly fascinating indeed. 
 
Today, solar panels work in a very specific way. For solar panels to work, sunlight must be hitting the panel. Obviously, if there is no sun, the solar panels won’t be working at that specific moment. This is why at night, solar panels aren’t working like they are in the day. Anyway, soon after the sun hits the panel, the photovoltaic solar cell absorbs the radiation from the sun. For the sun to hit the cell, it must go through the frame, glass, and encapsulant which makes up the solar panel. Once the sun does hit the cell, after passing through the first stages of the solar panel, electrons begin to move around internally. Nevertheless, a solar cell consists of a layer of p-type silicon placed next to a layer of n-type silicon which are sandwiched between two silicon layers. Inside the n-type, there is an excess of electrons while inside the p-type, there is an excess of positively charged holes. Between the n-type silicon layer and the p-type silicon layer, there is the depletion zone where electrons fill the holes. Once this is completed, the p-type of the depletion zone now contains negatively charged ions while the n-type consists of positively charged ions. Moreover, this creates an electric field which prevents electrons in the n-type layer to fill the holes in the p-type layer. Finally, when sunlight hits the cell, electrons in the holes are ejected resulting in the formation of the holes. All in all, when the p-type and n-type layers are connected with metallic wire or any wire that can generate electric current, the electrons will travel from the sides creating electricity. In a residential solar makeup, the solar panels convert the sunlight into DC energy which is then transferred to an inverter which transfers the electricity to AC for use. For all energy not needed, it goes back to the grid. In conclusion, solar panels aren’t too complicated and work following a basic method. Without the method present, solar panels wouldn’t be able to function as they do. 
 
In today’s era, solar panels are becoming increasingly more prominent and have been over the last few years. In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 50% amongst the US. Furthermore, there are currently over 240,000 Americans working in the solar industry with over 10,000 companies per state. In discussion with cost, the cost to install solar has rapidly dropped by more than 70% in the last decade with the average price per watt only being anywhere from $2.67 to $3.43 now. Comparing the prices to 70 years ago, there is a huge difference in cost. Currently, most solar is installed in Europe and East Asia which account for over 70% of global installations. The least happens to be in Africa, accounting for less than 1% of total global installations. Installations have been growing like wildfire ever since a jump in 2010. In 2000, there were no installations of solar in the US whatsoever. By 2016, the yearly installation reached almost 14,000 watts across residential PV (photovoltaic), non-residential PV, Utility PV, and Utility CSP. The US has also been emphasizing solar, with the annual additions of new electric capacity always growing each year ever since 2010. In 2010, that number was just 4%. In 2018, it was 29% out of all possible energies. Nevertheless, in the US, California has been a big player in solar with the most installations out of any state coming from California. In fact, California beats the next 9 states combined in terms of annual residential PV installations. By January 1st, 2020, California is making it mandatory for all new homes to come installed with solar panels. In terms of efficiency, most solar panels have above 20% conversion levels now. There are actually 7 different types of solar panels, with different types varying per company. Finally, solar panels can be found in solar farms, on residential homes, and commercial homes primarily. It is good to note solar farms are the most effective ways for solar panels to work and the most prominent way. To illustrate how solar is truly on the rise, the global solar energy sector is projected to reach $422 billion by 2022 up from $86 billion in 2016, according to Allied Market Research. In conclusion, it is clear solar panels are on the rise and becoming the energy choice of the future. Within 10 years, solar will have expanded greatly around the world like it has in the past 10. 
 
Clearly, the history of solar panels is quite eventful, the way they work is very fascinating and complex, and their current day status is very promising. Without solar panels in life, the world would suffer major losses without one of the most popular clean energy options around. Not only this, renewable energy would have to be limited to the current day, less promising options like wind energy. Jobs would also be lost, the economy wouldn’t be the same, and solar companies would seize to exist. In a world without solar panels, what would it be like?

His brand of climate change denial isn't denial at all, but a new brand called ""lukewarmism"", where he doesn't attempt to contradict IPCC or climate science *directly*, but instead cherry-picks facts to for instance ""show that you're focusing on the wrong things"" (bull).

The point is still the same though, confuse people as much as you can in order to let big oil/coal/gas make money. By (smartly and deviously) cherry-picking specific facts like ""more people die from tuberculosis than climate change"" he builds an idea that the problem is 'economic' and that spending money on climate change is basically 'wasted money'.

He associates with the much duller ""traditional"" denier Pielke Jr. who usually just posts his faulty research suggesting tornados/hurricanes aren't getting more common. Pielke Jr. has by comparison, already been caught lying several times in various ways.

0,So scientists are saying that there’s only 26 years left to fix what we’ve done. But still nothing seems to be getting done. There are so many loop holes in shit that it’s a up hill battle. For instance did u know that paper mills all over the US get paid millions of dollars for using “Green energy” because they use a by product call black liquor. This black liquor burns worst the gasoline. That’s just one thing. Not counting the money that the Baltimore city dump gets for relatively the same thing. America just broke a carbon record and spring is pretty much non existent here in Maryland. Home of the rain now. Is any one else really fucking aggravated by all this shit.

I had a few thoughts I wanted to share on my take of handling climate change. 

There are so many people concerned about climate change, and so many ways of handling components of the problem. Perhaps those who know climate change is real are approaching the issue incorrectly in how to make change. Our strategy being incorrect to handle the problem. What I disapprove of the most about how we handle it is any air of optimism about the issue. We are happy that small change happens, we are happy that some things happen however insignificant they may be. I feel like we aren't doing enough to invoke Sun Tzu's ""death ground"" doctrine -- where warriors fight 2 or even 3 times as powerful than they normal when placed with their backs to a wall. 

I feel now is really the time to drop any positivity, and drive home without any uncertainty that our days are numbered. We need a seize the moment aspect to our approach, in the same way as Cortez invoked when he sunk his ships in Mexico. That it is now or never. I don't think anyone has done an effective job of that. Sure the scientists give timelines and warnings etc, but how do I convince an idiot in Alabama that the world will burn until his mother dies of heat stroke? 

I feel like we need to drop the optimism, it never got us anywhere in the past, it won't get us anywhere now.Handling Climate Change -- An opinion"
0,"Did you know that cows in dairy production have a lifespan that is about 20% of the natural cow lifespan? (Gaard,“Toward a Feminist”). Most people drink cow milk and consume dairy products without considering the conditions cows go through to produce milk for human consumption. I too am guilty of consuming dairy products obliviously. The cruelty in dairy farming is something I only recently became aware of. After learning more about dairy farming, I told my friends about some of the things I learned, and they were just as shocked about dairy farm conditions as I was. Not enough people know about dairy farms and eat dairy without knowing the effects dairy consumption can have. 

The conditions cows live in on dairy farms are unsanitary and cruel. At fifteen months of age, dairy cows are artificially inseminated and begin a cycle of endless impregnation and lactation (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”).  To increase profit from the animals, farmers regularly inject hormones into the animals to unnaturally speed up the gestation process (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Dairy cows are milked two to three times a day by heavy machinery that can be painful and cause infections to the animals (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). All of the unnatural conditions dairy cows go through during the production of dairy shortens their lifespan. The natural lifespan of cows is twenty to twenty-five years long. The lifespan of cows in dairy production is typically four to five years, making up about 20% of what the natural cow lifespan is (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”). Many people are not aware of the damage that is done to cows during the forced production of milk.

Human consumption of dairy products has resulted in dairy farms taking advantage of animals for profit. Conditions of dairy farms and unjust treatment of animals on dairy farms can improve if humans consumed less cow milk. Human consumption of cow milk is unnatural, the human body is not biologically fit to consume cow milk (“Is Drinking Milk”;Wiley, “Cow Milk”). The human body naturally stops producing lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk) in middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Most humans cannot consume dairy without having digestion issues after middle childhood (Wiley, “Cow Milk”). Cow milk is a good source of Calcium and Vitamin D, but the consumption of cow milk has no direct health benefit for humans that we can’t receive through other plant-based foods such as soy milk (Gaard, “Toward a Feminist”;“Is Drinking Milk”;“18 Non-Dairy”). Soy milk is a plant-based food that essentially has the same health benefits as cow milk. Soy milk contains the same amount of calcium as cow milk and is also a good source of Vitamin D (“18 Non-Dairy”). Some other foods that offer the same health benefits as cow milk are kale, broccoli, chia seeds, almonds, and figs (“18 Non-Dairy”). By switching to other dairy alternatives, like almond or oat milk, we can greatly reduce the negative impact humans contribute to the dairy farming practice. The torture and bad conditions that cows face to produce milk for human consumption is an issue that doesn’t get enough attention. I encourage you to share this information with your friends and help bring awareness to the poor conditions of dairy farms.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the late 1800’s, the past 5 years have been the hottest years on record and the temperature keeps rising. As humans, our effects on this drastic change is apparent, from a natural perspective, the largest source of Co2 comes from volcanoes generating 200 million tons of carbon annually, just our automotive and industrial activities alone cause 23 billion world wide in the same time frame (“Are Volcanoes or Humans Harder on the Atmosphere?”). Solving Climate Change is going to be a long and difficult process, our modern and comfortable ways of life here in American would be altered completely but if left undealt with, its estimated that Damages could be as high as 20% of worldwide GDP, if action is taken it would only cost 1-4% of the GDP by 2030. Being that buildings are responsible for 38% of all Co2 emissions (“How Buildings Impact the Environment”), changing the way American housing is handled would prove to be very beneficial to reducing this number. For example, by increasing the use of individual green energy systems such as household solar power and decreasing the use of exposed concrete in cities are both simple ways a positive impact can be made. 

Before we look at the ways we can help decrease the impact of buildings, it's important to figure out where funding for projects of this magnitude could come from. Creating restrictions such as a carbon tax could prove to be beneficial. The Carbon Tax method can be seen in use worldwide (26 programs total) and is proving to have good effects on the economy and environment alike. The B.C Government's Carbon Tax Brochure describes the idea behind the method, “Tax the pollution we do not want, and return the money for what we do want - money in people’s pockets, jobs and investment.” This taxation does a good job of making the transition to a healthier environment without putting the US more in dept to ourselves. When looking at incorporating a National Carbon tax into a nation so diverse in an industrialized sense, places that are heavily industrialized or have a large population such as Texas or California, would be receiving more funding for the more improvement needed. In the end this method would create a lower and more equal carbon footprint among the states. British Columbia is only one of the many places that have taken advantage of this system. With these 26 carbon tax programs already in use, it can give us a good idea of what to expect from the system and shows that if done correctly it can be beneficial for both the economy and the planet. 

Now that the funding is out of the way, we can start looking at the changes that can be made to better our environment. As we progress further into the future, an abundance of discoveries and improvements are being made with the ability to have a substantial impact on how we go about making this change. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric and more, are quickly becoming part of our energy mix but still only account for 11% of America's energy use (“The United States Uses a Mix of Energy Sources”). Increasing this number is an important step to a healthier future. When looking at housing in rural or suburban areas, the usage of rooftop solar is pretty logical being that plenty of open roof space is available, using the money collected from the carbon tax, we would be able to fund the installation of these household solar panels. With this method all excess electricity generated could also be pumped into the grid, further lowering the reliance on fossil fuels. Unfortunately highly Urbanized areas currently account for 20% of our overall carbon footprint (Miller), because of the lack of roof space available and the dense living population, solar as seen in more rural areas wouldn’t prove as effective. In places such as these, the new technology of solar windows could be a major contributor in the future of city energy. According to research at Michigan State, the United States could get 40% of its electricity from solar windows, the University estimates that 5 to 7 billion square meters of usable window space is available, when paired with 15% efficient panels, that 40% could be achieved. In practice, covering those billions of window space is substantial task to be achieved, nevertheless this surely goes to show how big of a role this technology can play in future green cities even if used on a smaller scale.  

Moving away from solar, other building techniques have been proving beneficial to lowering the impact of urban areas. The Urban Heat Island effect has also had a substantial impact on the energy usage in cities. Compared to surrounding rural areas, its estimated that a city with 1 million people or more can be up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer during the day and 22 degrees warmer at night(Donegan), much of this effect can be credited towards open concrete soaking up the sun's energy, windows reflecting and the heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions. With all the tall skyscrapers, the natural, cooling wind flow is also obstructed. In Nature, soil does a good job soaking up the rain, which on warm days, would be evaporated, in turn, cooling the air, with cities most of this rainwater just runs down into the sewer system. 

The introduction of window solar panels would help decrease the reflection of the sun's energy but besides that solution, looking to minimize the amount of heat soaking into the concrete would be beneficial. In Manhattan, there is up to 40 square miles of rooftop space, to help fight the urban heat, the NYC CoolRoofs program has reduced the temperature of 6 million square feet by painting the roofs white. On hot days the dark asphalt can reach up to 190 degrees, if the program continues making progress its estimated this would cool New York’s air temperature by 2 degrees (McKendry). Although just 2 degrees may seem like a small number, when put in conjunction with other methods, a noticeable difference can be made. Rooftop gardens have also been seen to make a difference, because of the water and heat soaking soil, the water evaporates creating cooler air and creating food in the process. Simple and cheap solutions like the ones listed above can have massive impacts when implemented on a citywide scale, in response to creating a cooler urban environment, the need for energy eating devices such as air conditioning would also decrease.

Creating an entirely green city would prove to be a task that may take many years but so far, we seem to be heading that direction. Using some of the methods above, digital designs of future sustainable housing developments are starting to form. Although sparse, neighborhoods are already starting to form providing to be a proof of concept, so far many are quite successful. Currently here on the Pacific Coast, a model eco-friendly neighborhood is being constructed with the goal of having little to no negative environmental impacts (no carbon, trash, and have sustainable water management). The success of developments such as this show that this change can be done, it's just the matter of time and commitment.

The change to a more Eco-friendly way of living is going to be a very long process, in order to make this change, we will at some point, need to give up many of our basic comforts we use so often. Totally changing how products are being manufactured would call for a major shift in the values corporations and civilians must follow. By starting this change from a place such as buildings and city design, we are able to make an impact without having to alter the basis of our economy relying on our industrialized ways. Other technologies are constantly improving and becoming more viable with helping this change. With more and more communities, programs, and research going into solving this issue, we are surely going to be seeing change for the better within the future.Funding green living though Carbon Tax"
0,"This May, global levels of CO2 reached 414.8 ppm; 3.5ppm higher than May 2018. If concentrations rise to more than 450ppm, the resulting shift in carbon dioxide levels will trigger extreme weather events and temperature rises as high as 2 degrees Celsius; after this level, global heating will become a catastrophic and irreversible positive feedback loop.

Please join World Environment Day on June 5th to take action against air pollution by informing others about this critical concern.

So, I've tried to be conscious of the environment my whole life. I'm not great at it. I don't deserve any commendations. Just trying to leave no/minimal carbon footprints.

(I am a vegetarian but I don't include that towards my love for the planet, I just don't care for meat and cows are adorable.)

Anyway, I have spent a good portion of my life straying away from animal products and I try not to buy frivolously and I turn the water off while brushing my teeth and I only order online once a week so less gas/transportation is used... ect.

But now a lot of the stuff I own is plastic. &gt;Some of you already see the problem.&lt; Like, a few months ago I wanted to buy an exfoliating brush and I thought I was doing a good job by not buying the one made out of boar bristles but its made of plastic which as I'm researching more and more into seems to be *so much worse*. I don't live in California but I've taken the no-straws-life into heart. I'm trying to reuse more things. What products should I look into buying if I want a healthier planet?How can I help?"

0,"You see it constantly: The last IPCC report mistakenly quoted as saying we have 12 years (now less) to do something about emissions. What the IPCC report actually says is that we must start reducing emissions immediately, and picks out 2 time points, 2030 and 2050, to illustrate the timeline (45% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 for a good chance to keep warming under 1.5C).

In order to get to a 45% cut by 2030, we have to cut about 4.6% per year, every year, starting this year. Instead, emissions are still rising. Even if emissions were flat, we would no longer have 11 years after this one to cut emissions by 45% because we will have failed to cut this year.

Really what the report told us is that the 1.5C ship has already sailed. Cutting that much emissions would tank the economy, which very few people want.

Soon, I'm going to have a meeting with a few teachers high up in the school to attempt to reform the school into a genuinely more environmentaly friendly establishment, because, frankly, I'm completely sick of the school's half-arsed attempt to become more green by sticking up some shitty posters about not buying plastic water bottles, as they continue to sell and package fruit in single-use crap. There are some major problems I have identified from being in the school that will be easy to solve, and some not as easy.

For starters, my school's recycling system is pretty much non-existant. Which I would say is disgraceful and lazy, it's really not difficult to set up a functional recycling bin system. This should be relatively simple to solve. Another serious issue I've listed is the ridiculous over-use of single-use plastics in the school. The school canteen sells tens of products wrapped in plastic, in plastic cups or in a plastic box, only for it to be thrown in the bin about 10 minutes after it was bought. This issue is a little harder to solve for me, as it is difficult for me to provide the school with some sort of easy alternative that they can deliver food in. Does anyone know of something I could suggest to the school as an alternative? 

There are some things I can't be sure of, like energy usage, but maybe in the future I would be able to try and reform this.

At the moment, I'm really sick of seeing no one giving a shit about this at my school. Unfortunately for me, I don't have a huge amount of leverage with them, seeing as they are a school and I am a single student. I'm still hoping I can make somewhat of a difference. 

Thank you very much.

**TL;DR - Please provide me with some alternatives I could suggest my school could use as an alternative to wrapping food products in plastic.**r/environment, please help me to bring some change to my school."

How can I convert my career into helping climate change? 

My strongest skill is currently conversion rate optimization (software application ux): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization

I have been running controlled hypothesis driven market research tests within application interfaces for 5.5 years. Theoretically, you could swap out the hypothesis + metric to optimize, and I can run tests outside of a marketing capacity. It's certainly applicable in all types of software development, but I think it's also applicable to things like supply chain management or manufacturing process.


This type of a/b testing must be able to apply somewhere in the field.. Any guidance is much appreciated!Converting A Career Into Environmental Field"
0,"The current crisis of our society is Climate change at the moment, but what’s is the point!? It is hard to believe that people like Leonardo DiCaprio are advocating for us to change our ways of living when he tells us to stop using gas cars as he continues riding his private jets, it’s just hypocritical.

Even now, I may agree that the crisis we are in now is really bad, but honestly, I haven’t changed my ways of living at all. I still take long showers, I don’t use renewable energy, and even now typing this on the computer is contributing to climate change. How? The electricity powering my pc is from a fossil fuel power station which just released more carbon into the atmosphere.

People around the world are skipping work, class, and other important activities to protest for climate change. It sometimes works, but thick headed governments who refuse to make legislation for climate change ignore the issue. And all that protesting which made you miss work and school was for nothing. 

Don’t get me wrong here, I want to solve this issue very badly so we can move on a solve other major world issues, but climate comes first to ensure we even have a future! My problem is that are we even doing the right thing? Are you doing your part to slow down climate change? Even so, I believe that even if we have 5% of the world change to renewable energy it still won’t be enough, we all need to contribute and kick in, the reason I haven’t changed is due to the fact that I question if it even makes a difference. One person changing their ways of living in order to combat climate change is pointless, how about billions of people changing their ways of living, Nope, I think that it’s is impossible. 

I just feel that currently the risks outweigh the benefits here, I just hope we all get our shit together.Have y’all really changed?"
0,"Hello all,

I am a student at the University of Michigan who, like many of you, is deeply concerned by our government's inaction on Climate Change and fearful of the world myself and our future generations will live in. My post is somewhat US-centric, so apologies to our foreign neighbors. I am also speaking to the students and young people among us, but I welcome everyone to read.

Many of you have heard of climate protests in Europe, in Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, China and around the world. Some of you may have participated in such protests in our own country, the United States. And yet, as inspiring and ambitious as all of these protests are, I cannot help but feel that they are all too often extremely vacuous, that we are simply shouting to the wind, unheard by those who hold the power to make real change. 

But it need not be this way. If we look to history we can find countless examples of civil disobedience movements bringing about revolutionary change. We can look to the Indian independence movement which brought the world's greatest empire to its knees and liberated hundreds of millions. We can look to the great heroes of our mid-century civil rights movement, which won freedoms for African Americans and other minorities that had been denied for centuries. We can look to the womens' movement which has massively expanded womens' rights after countless millennia of oppression. So many of these movements, whose results we too often take for granted today, were instigated and supported by young people and students like ourselves.

I am seeking to build such a movement for Climate Change today. 

We must seek out and promote the great orators of our generation, those who can persuade the American people and its politicians of the inherent urgency required to address climate change. We must build a national, inter-university infrastructure that is capable of applying acute political pressure wherever it is needed. We must be capable of holding mass protests, walk-outs, hunger strikes and marches of millions not just once year, but at the first indication that our demands are not being met. We must seek dialogue with politicians of all political stripes, at all levels of government. And we must bring into the fold all Americans with a fervor for action in their heart. We must help them realize the changes they want to see, the changes which are necessary to keep our planet livable.

Every generation before us has shirked their responsibility. The burden is ours now. We must carry it together.

TL;DR: We need a muscular climate movement capable of applying political pressure wherever it is needed if we are to take real action on climate change. I am seeking to organize such a movement, and am asking for your help. 

I will be reaching out to all relevant organizations at my university to organize this movement starting tomorrow. I will see about being published in my schools newspaper, and I will also be posting in dozens of other subreddits and on all other forms of social media to get the word out. I ask that all of you do the same. This cannot be a movement sprouting from a single mouth, or out of a single university. From the start, we must be a national, inter-university movement. If there is anything you can do to contribute to the cause, please PM me your details and I will begin constructing a listserv (at least your email, but phone numbers or other forms of contact are welcome).Inter-University Climate Movement"

Is a homeless man unable to chop down some trees to build his own house in place of those trees?

&amp;#x200B;

Since wood only grows on surface, and all but near surface of tree is dead, wouldnt it have many times the surface area in tightly packed thin trees? Couldnt you convert near any amount of dirt into a dense 3d block of wood in a few months if things added? For example, light diffuses in fog, so if it were very foggy in the dense block, light might get through even when no direct path, and fog counts as watering. Frequencies?

If I dropped a truckload of something cheap squirrels eat from a plane spread over a huge forest spread out in time, then soon I'd have all the squirrels I could eat, though unsure if they're often diseased. I've eaten roasted squirrel, few hours on low heat, pretty good. The large area cuz they seem repelled by too many other squirrels. Squirrels and birds seem to be the most efficient food finders, picking through stuff. I might even get squirrels to aerate the dirt by hiding a bunch of pieces of food in the dirt so they'll learn its in there somewhere. How much would it cost to vaccine an 18 wheeler with levels every 6 inches packed with squirrels just tight enough they dont get agitated? I could probably make a trap that looks safe to squirrels and they just fall into a huge box. Or if some kind of noise generator etc surrounded them and pushed them inward. If I took some already around my house some would come to replace them when the food density wasnt lowered by those eating it.I live near huge areas of unoccupied forest, spread sparsely. If I bought it somehow and cut down some of the trees could I sell it for more to farmers? Is dirt that trees etc eat good for anything? Food grows on its own.

0,"Global warming and scaremongering !!

Abstract
A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and emits infrared radiation. The primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is a nontoxic, colorless, odorless gas. Water vapor accounts for by far the largest greenhouse effect (90–85%) because water vapor emits and absorbs infrared radiation at many more wavelengths than any of the other greenhouse gases, and there is much more water vapor in the atmosphere than any of the other greenhouse gases. CO2 makes up only a tiny portion of the atmosphere (0.040%) and constitutes only 3.6% of the greenhouse effect. The atmospheric content of CO2 has increased only 0.008% since emissions began to soar after 1945. Such a tiny increment of increase in CO2 cannot cause the 10°F increase in temperature predicted by CO2 advocates. Computer climate modelers build into their models a high water vapor component, which they claim is due to increased atmospheric water vapor caused by very small warming from CO2, and since water vapor makes up 90–95% of the greenhouse effect, they claim the result will be warming. The problem is that atmospheric water vapor has actually declined since 1948, not increased as demanded by climate models. If CO2 causes global warming, then CO2 should always precede warming when the Earth's climate warms up after an ice age. However, in all cases, CO2 lags warming by ∼800 years. Shorter time spans show the same thing—warming always precedes an increase in CO2 and therefore it cannot be the cause of the warming.You don’t hear this on mainstream media"

0,"The Problem With Pollution

As we all know pollution has been a problem for the longest time. Some people could honestly care less about pollution but they should. Everyone does things to cause pollution even though they say that they don’t. Everyone has thrown trash on the floor like bottles, candy/food wrappers, gum and more. Pollution  is even caused by all automobiles which can’t really be when people are constantly using them. 80% of marine pollution comes from land-based sources and in most developing countries 90% of wastewater and 70% of industrial waste is discharged without treatment. Pollution is such a problem that 6.5 tons enter the world’s oceans each year. Factories dump toxic waste into rivers, lakes, or even oceans which can make that water undrinkable for animals and uninhabitable for animals. Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year,People who live in places with high levels of air pollutants have a 20% higher risk of death from lung cancer than people who live in less-polluted areas. A team of researchers in the United States and Australia analyzed plastic waste levels in the world's oceans and found out that China and Indonesia are the main sources for plastic bottles, and bags clogging up global sea lanes. There's a floating pile of plastic waste floating in the Atlantic Ocean called the North Atlantic garbage patch, it is estimated to be over 200,000 pieces of debris per square kilometer. People can help to stop the pollution in the air, oceans/lakes, and on the ground. To stop the pollution on the ground everyone could start be actually putting trash on trash cans or holding onto them until you have somewhere to throw it away and not just throwing out of the car window. When we pollute in oceans it doesn’t break down as fast and animals can mistake it for food and could possibly die from eating it. Pollution in the ocean causes the death of more than 11 million seabirds every year. Around 300 thousand dolphins die from pollution in the ocean because they get entangled with discarded fishing nets. And around 100 thousand sea mammals die every year because of pollution.pollution"

0,"China is currently the world’s largest polluter. Certain provinces are so polluted with smog that you have to wear a mask to breathe properly. 

Sad Fact: It’s so bad that a company is selling over 10,000 canned fresh air monthly at $24 each.

China is aggressively trying to change this public perception, but with so much bitcoin mining in China, it certainly doesn’t help its case, because 60% of China’s electricity comes from coal-burning plants. Mining rigs are used to mine bitcoins and they require powerful hardware and consumes electricity like no tomorrow.

There’s the famous saying, “With   great power, comes great electricity bills.”

In fact, in a single day, the electricity used for bitcoin mining in China is enough to power the average American household for over 5 million years.

Unfortunately, this problem is only going to get worse. Bitcoin was designed with a cap of 21 million coins, and the more coins mined, the harder and more electricity it consumes to mine.

Because electricity makes up about 70% of the cost of mining, miners want the cheapest electricity. And that place is Sichuan, where it has over 1400 rivers and 3200 hydro plants that produce cheap hydropower at just $0.01 per kWh compared to about $0.12 in US   or $0.16 in Singapore.

In fact, bitcoin mining is about 80% powered by renewable energy, which is about   4 times more than the global average of about 20%, making bitcoin mining much cleaner than most industries. 

However,  hydropower is seasonal, the wet season generates 3 times more electricity than the dry season.

Since mining rigs do not turn off, during the dry season when hydropower is not sufficient, coal-based electricity is used instead.

The carbon emission factor of electricity in Sichuan, therefore, ranges from 265 to 579 gCO2/kWh depending on the season.

Much higher compared to Sweden with a carbon emission factor of 13 gCO2/kWh, but it’s because Sweden’s electricity is fuelled mostly by **nuclear** and **hydroelectric power**.

The electricity cost of mining 1 bitcoin in China is about $3172, one of the lowest in the world.

But as the price of bitcoin crashed, known as the crypto winter, it was crucial to use the latest and most efficient mining rigs in order to be profitable. However, regularly upgrading causes a lot of e-waste which is an environmental concern.   

A  report finds that “the annualized e-waste generation of mining rigs would  amount to 10,948 metric tons.” That is about 20% of the e-waste generated by a country like Singapore. 

Places like Iceland and Canada have massive amounts of clean renewable energy in the form of hydropower or geothermal. In fact, a bitcoin mined in China emits 4 times the CO2 than a Canadian-mined bitcoin.

Hopefully, in the near future, there could be a practical solution that is secure, fast, and energy efficient to use, and we can all start enjoying greater benefits.

Three examples of earlier research include:

* A short-term Canadian study found bees’ presence was associated with much higher yields in food-grade soybeans.
* Australian researchers demonstrated yield increases of 10-40% in honey bee-pollinated soybeans, compared to self-pollinated beans.
* In 2005, a Brazilian research project compared soybean seed production with and without honey bee colonies by raising plants in cages, and reported 50% higher yields when bees were present.

Some want to argue that seed crops that self pollinate and roundup ready don't need bees and thus spraying millions of gallons of the weed killer does no harm to the environment and all news to the contrary is BS. Well I say BS to that false belief. Now we learn that the main ingredient in roundup causes cancer in humans.

For example:  “This [grocery store] sells individually plastic wrapped-potatoes” is certainly infuriating, how about a letter for us to sign to the company that says “this is stupid. Stop or we’ll never shop their again”?

(Or conversely, “Trader Joe’s is reducing their plastic by ____%, let’s sign a letter thanking them and encouraging them to continue to reduce their impact”)

Serious discussion, no emotionally driven opinions please. This is a post follow up of deceased drug lord Pablo Escobar's hippos starting to slowly grow in population within Colombia's Magdelena river. At least 40-60 hippos and growing. When I first saw this, I immediately felt disturbed and thought the easiest way to get rid of them would to be to set up a controlled hunting program, but that wasn't until I read that they might potentially be a beneficial addition given the way they may be fertilizing the waters and eventually Magdelena's forests (I do not know how nutrient rich the soil in Magdelena's forest is) but also could become a problem over-fertilizing the water, killing fish, and may pose a threat to the other native organisms such as manatees if they become too aggressive. The pros and cons of hippos living with humans in Africa can be the same in Colombia. So I'd like more insight and discussion how these hippos could potentially impact the ecosystem, whether it's good or bad.Pablo Escobar's Hippos Growing in Population"

I am so thrilled, as I find a lot of satisfaction and joy in simply being outside, gardening, etc. Being keenly aware of both the havoc pesticide usage wreaks on ecosystems, and the startling statistic that a sum 50% of insect populations are declining, I started researching ways to encourage a sort of sanctuary garden on my future land. 

Here are a lot of interesting things I learned:

1.It is basically useless planting non-native species. The plant and insect and animal species native to your region have co-evolved together for millennia, a lot of them NEED each other for survival. So look up natives and plant those. They’ll be easier to take care of too. 

2. Most native North American bees don’t make hives like you commonly think of, but rather have hives in the ground or burrows. Honey bees were imported from Europe circa colonization and frankly aren’t nearly as important as native populations (contextually).  

3. Don’t use pesticide (clearly). This one is a given, but fr like don’t. Surefire way to just fuck up all sorts of shit you don’t realize. Even native weeds serve a purpose and are important to some organism somehow. 

4. Mowing your lawn is *bad*. So so many insects lay their larva on the ground, on leaf litter; most native bees burrow beneath our feet, native wildlife tries to take root in its natural habitat, bunnies burrow.... we interrupt so many natural processes and life cycle just by cutting everything down before it has a real chance to thrive. Imagine how many insects, birds, wildlife species would be more likely to rebound if every suburbia in America just gave up this manicured idea of a bare patch-of-turf grass lawn and let what would naturally grow there *grow.  And added bonus, NO ONE HAS TO MOW LAWNS ANYMORE. 

5. Once your native plants take hold, and are given an opportunity to thrive, more native wildlife will be attracted to your land. You have to be accepting of every individual that arrives, because all these life cycles are intertwined. You can’t plant milkweed, and then exterminate milkweed bugs that are attracted to it. The predators that then eat the milkweed bugs won’t come, and so on.

It’s a win-win for everybody.Movement to stop mowing lawns- all in favor say aye!"

Tiff Needell (he's a racing driver for those of you who don't know his name) was presenter and was on all the time but the interviewees were being changed every half hour, with some pretty big names on stage like Richard Noble [OBE], for example.

Anyway, to the point: one of the interviewees was a motoring journalist called Mike Rutherford talking about the future of motoring. I asked: why is it that the UK government deems that these electric cars are even allowed to be made when so many different rare earth materials are being used, producing insane life cycles and just producing so much pollution?

Mike replied (I'm paraphrasing):

""The UK government doesn't know what it is. It allows diesels to be run and twenty years ago I, the rest of the motorjournalism industry, and the governments of the world knew that these diesels were carcinogenic and that they would endanger populations. And yet, the UK decided that they would support diesels like they were the future and that they were clean and not dangerous. Now the public supposedly knows that this diesel preaching is nonsense, so why do they still take the buses, run by ancient diesel engines? Why do they believe that the government actually knows what they're on about?
Why do people come to London by plane, using expensive and not ecologically friendly at all jet fuel, just so that they can complain about the environment? These people want to help the environment but they don't want to give up their plane flights."" 
There is more but this is all I remember well.

One of the first thoughts I had was that maybe it could be easier to somehow produce recycling bins that separate popular materials like paper, plastic, and glass. Since these materials are so different in composition, I think if scientists put enough energy into this, they can invent a cheap version to spread to communities. But idk, maybe it’s harder in practice than I think, or maybe this idea won’t be as effective as I described.

[https://www.tulsigabbard.org/tulsi-gabbard-on-climate-change](https://www.tulsigabbard.org/tulsi-gabbard-on-climate-change)

Tulsi Gabbard (2020 candidate) has issues with the Green New Deal in that it does not address fracking or nuclear energy (the GND favors nuclear alts which lead to nuclear waste). That's why she only supports the ""concept"" of the Green New Deal and has not co-sponsored it (despite pressure from her party).

The Green New Deal also makes general statements that mushes in various other Dem issues (free college, healthcare) basically making it impossible to pass in Congress and stopping it from addressing climate change. Tulsi's OFF Fossil Fuels Act, however, provides clear objectives with a timeline and simple focus on addressing the environment.

I urge you all to look at the article and a take a simple look at how much more clear and objective the OFF Fossil Fuels Act is. This is why many corporate Democrats and 2020 candidates have no issue supporting the GND; it does not give a timeline, it does not have any potential of actually passing and making an impact, and so it does not push these candidates and legislators to take any real action. It's just a soundbite or vision.

Please consider spreading the message and support of Rep Tulsi Gabbard's (HI) OFF Fossil Fuels Act alongside the Green New Deal. The ultimate goal of both the is to prioritize the health of people and the economy of the U.S. over the profit of the fossil fuel industry. Spread the word and support. Passing the GND will take a groundswell of support. We must reduce CO2 emissions drastically by 2030, we have no time to waste. Support the OFF Act.

Corporate America is calling on Congress to pass big climate policy in the most aggressive and united way since 2009, Axios' Amy Harder writes in her weekly ""Harder Line"" energy column.

Companies across the economy, including big oil producers, are beginning to lobby Washington to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions.
A new coalition called CEO Climate Dialogue launched last week.
Executives from 75+ companies will be on Capitol Hill this week to lobby.
The intrigue: This is happening against a tumultuous background that may not welcome such a shift.

On one side, President Trump outright dismisses climate change.
On the other, a loud chorus of environmentalists and progressive leaders is led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Where it stands: Three separate but similar corporate-led campaigns are calling for an explicit price on carbon emissions.

Three big energy companies — Shell, BP and EDF Renewables — have each newly committed $1 million over two years to a lobbying group, called Americans for Carbon Dividends. That group wants Congress to pass policy putting a tax (backers call it a fee) on carbon and returning the money raised to consumers. It already has funding from numerous other big companies, including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.
The nonprofit Ceres, which works on sustainable investments, is organizing a lobbying push this week with more than 75 companies, including BP, Microsoft and Tesla.
Be smart: This is driven by investor and legal pressure, falling prices for renewable energy, new bounties of cleaner-burning natural gas and growing public concern about a warming planet.

The fervor around the Green New Deal has accelerated this shift among businesses, which worry about the far reach of that progressive proposal.Corporate shift on climate change"

0," he sun, that nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma at the center of our solar system, is estimated to be about 4.5 billion years old. It's also estimated that the sun will be around for at least another 4.5 billion years, so from a human perspective it isn't much of an exaggeration to say that the sun is eternal. We have known, long before we possessed the science to prove it, that our sun is the powerhouse of all life on earth and that without it humans wouldn't exist. But only very recently in our history have we discovered that the sun's energy could be harnessed and used to power our homes, businesses, vehicles, appliances, and so much more.

Nowadays people have faced with the problems of their health. The reason people suffer from different diseases is not only their unhealthy lifestyle and harmful addictions but also environment pollution because of in particular constant development of natural resources. It’s really disappointing fact but more often than not oil companies don’t care about ecological safety and do damage to environment in compliance with human health. Here I’d like to mention one of the biggest in the world oil and gas company “Shell” that goes in oil extraction in Sakhalin too. This company is charged with oil spills on repeated occasions. If you don’t believe me, you can go to the page using the link below without any hesitation.

Every year is hotter than the last, every natural disaster increases in severity and occurrence - at what point do we, the inheritors of our parents and grandparents reckless abandon, say enough is enough?

0,"Hi there!

A lot of environmentalists have different ideas about how we can create a greener, more sustainable world. Some advocate for rewilding, others for a 'Green New Deal', etc etc.

But I'm here to talk to you about a radical alternative socioeconomic system that has a core focus of sustainability and public health and wellbeing, a new social order founded on something called a Resource Based Economy, or RBE for short. In short, an RBE is an economy where we use technology to its full potential in order to raise people's standard of living significantly, while keeping within our planet's means.

Alongside this goal of sustainability, the goal of an RBE is to create a system of relative material abundance, through things like forgoing property norms in favour of access, and building things to last instead of conducting the wasteful practice of planned obsolescence. With this in mind, as well as many other concepts - RBE proponents want a moneyless society, free of debt, barter, and trade, where everyone can readily access the goods and services they need free of cost. 

I run a YouTube channel largely dedicated to the advocacy of RBEs, as well as educating people about the concepts and theories behind the idea. In my latest video, I cover the concept of localisation, and how it can be good for our planet.

Also, they don’t know how their money will be spent. Our concept tries to address those concerns. One page within the app is dedicated to ocean cleanup charities. Another one to deforestation charities. We would love to hear your opinion.

\[Proposed concept\]

The picture below illustrates an ongoing animation of the ocean. The scene, visible in the app, represents the current status of our ocean. Each cleanup-charity is visualised with a boat. Whenever you tap a polluted area in the app, you can donate money and a boat will move to the area and clean up trash. The smaller the contribution, the smaller the area that will be cleaned; but, it shows that even small contributions matter in the bigger picture. Also, it illustrates how much work still needs to be done. Each time you open the app, the scene will be updated with “cleanups” from others.

[Plastic Ocean ](https://i.redd.it/nxwn76u73sz21.png)

The same applies to the deforestation concept. The more you donate, the bigger the forest will grow.

YouTube seemed like an okay platform - at least from a consumer standpoint.

Then in late December 2019 they started showing more ads.  I watch it primarily on my ""smart"" Samsung TV, so I don't have any blockers, etc.

Then in mid-February 2020 they started showing MORE ads.

Over the past week they've ramped the number of ads up YET AGAIN - even thrusting ads into channels which have never before shown ads.

&amp;#x200B;

My strategy has become to exit a video as soon as an ad plays, which means I have fewer and fewer options of anything to view on YouTube.

&amp;#x200B;

ADDITIONALLY YouTube never fixed their error of showing ads and having the original video continue playing behind the ad, such that when you start seeing what you wanted to again, it has now skipped many seconds - or, in the case of watching a full-episode ""ad"" like Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist (which I actually liked) the original video is long gone and cannot be accessed again.

1,"Recently I have been hearing more and more that people complaining about how not all phones are universal. How it is a struggle of whether your friends have your phone charging cable. EU is trying to standardize the phone charger. REALLY?! Does nobody remember back when everyone had flip phones and sliders. Almost every single phone had a different kind of charging cable. At least today you have a 1 out of 3 shot that someone will have the same charger as you. Also don't even get me started on the fact that if the phone had the right cable but was older or newer and could completely screw up your battery if the voltage was wrong.

It makes me laugh thinking about how many people do not understand or remember the struggle of cellphone chargers. This was just ten years ago when most people did not have smart phones yet. I want to hear what you all think about this. I personally think it’s stupid that they are trying to standardize it. It stifles innovation and can possibly screw up some big pushes companies are trying to do soon but haven’t announced.EU wanting to standardize changing cables. People complaining about multiple kinds of chargers out there."

From what I gather, it's ran by a guy in Germany who specializes in various computer sciences and I believe he is very well read.
His website shows he a very capable programmer with interests in privacy, cryptology,  and circumvention of sophisticated network attacks. 
The sub is supposedly a test sub ran by bots that seemingly post random material.

On the subreddit, there are various bots that post a myriad of things. Some apparently random, some appear to have bits of onion links, bitcoin wallet addresses and at times pieces of code in various languages such as Python, C and even Prolog (maybe?)

All posts by the bots are followed by another that replies with several words as an alliteration as well as what appears to be Morse code and binary sequences that don't offer much but similar alliteration and technical computer terms.

One post in particular I happened to dig into was posting pieces of an NSA Maintenance Guide to their early classified computer systems named ABNER II.
One also appeared to have pieces of a Russian guide into TCP hijacking. 

It frequently posts in Russian as well as English. 

I know Reddit is host to it's fair share of strange subreddits and many are just jokes to keep people digging for nothing.. But this appears to be more than that. Does anyone have any insight to offer?What is r/nulltheworldproblems?"

argues all products of human thought end in meaninglessness

examples/case studies

1)Mathematics/science ends in contradiction:an integer=a non-integer

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/MATHEMATICS.pdf

or

https://www.scribd.com/document/40697621/Mathematics-Ends-in-Meaninglessness-ie-self-contradiction

all very simple and clear

the facts are

1) it is proven an integer = a non-integer

1 is a finite number it stops

A finite decimal is one that stops, like 0.157

A non-finite decimal like 0.888... does not stop

A non-finite decimal like 0.999... does not stop

when a finite number 1 = a non-finite number 0.999.. then maths ends in contradiction

another way

1 is an integer a whole number

0.888... is a non-integer it is not a whole number

0.999... is a non-integer not a whole number

when a integer 1 =a non-integer 0.999... maths ends in contradiction

)1)Darwins book is called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection ....

but

this paper shows natural selection is not the origin of new species Natural selection is not the origin of new species

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/philosophy/Natural_selection.pdf

""Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant""

2) Biologist cant tell us what a species is -without contradiction thus evolution theory ie evolving species is nonsense

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/BIOLOGISTS-DON.pdf

Biologists agree there is species hybridization

but that contradicts what a species is

3) biologist tell us they investigate life

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/Bbiology-is-not-a-science.pdf

but

they cant tell us what life is-they can tell us what life does but cant tell us what life is they cant even give a definition of life that is not nonsense

You can prove Nihilism is objectively true

Magister colin leslie dean the only modern Renaissance man

HAS SHOWN

First you can prove by logic all products of human thinking end in meaningless

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/All-things-are-possible.pdf

Now natural language is inconsistent “now it is clear from the work of Tarski that the language of everyday speech is” semantically closed” and hence inconsistent”""

thus

""Now with the inconsistency of language all possible views and their negation are now possible""

""Each view contains within it its negation as all views end in meaninglessness""

Second you can then prove using that logic that the logic you use ends in paradox

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/logiccentrismbook.pdf

""Aristotelian logic as an epistemic condition of truth, the grand narrative of western philosophy: logic-centrism, the limitations of Aristotelian logic, the end of Aristotelian logic, logic/essence and language lead to the meaningless of all views""For those maths based research proofs that mathematics ends in meaninglessness"

For example, if I call a friend a rude name in a loving way it’ll send that to her and lists it as cyberbulling. Another example, my friend sent a picture of a buff Jojo character in a wedding dress and it sent it to my mom as sexual content.

1,"&gt;The phrasing around the [file and directory access restrictions](https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage#file-directory-restrictions) puts the blame on developers. How *dare* we ask for the Downloads/document tree, or for files in Android/data/directories!  
&gt;  
&gt;In reality, developers don’t do that. Developers simply fire off ACTION\_OPEN\_DOCUMENT, ACTION\_OPEN\_DOCUMENT\_TREE, or ACTION\_CREATE\_DOCUMENTIntents. Where the user winds up choosing is up to the user.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, in reality, **the restrictions listed in this section will be placed on** ***users***\*\*, not developers\*\*. And I have absolutely no idea **what sort of messaging Google could use** in the Storage Access Framework UI **that would justify to the user blocking them from navigating to certain portions of external and removable storage**. “Sorry, you can’t choose Downloads/, because ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯” doesn’t strike me as something that will make users very happy.  
&gt;  
&gt;**I am all for improved user control over privacy and security concerns, but the boundaries between what is and is not allowed need to make sense to users and, secondarily, to developers.**

A Two TeraHertz (2000 Gigahertz) Gallium Arsenide-substrate super-chip that is a 128-bits wide combined CPU, GPU, DSP and Array Processor coming out 2nd quarter 2021 and all for COMPLETELY FREE !!!! (you pay shipping though!)

What are YOU going to do with it??? WE want to know --- So post here with your stories!

What will YOU design, code, simulate and/or BUILD with such a supercomputing system at YOUR personal disposal?

SOME BACKGROUND ON OUR COMPANY AND THE SYSTEM ITSELF:

We are a Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada-based company that is a completely under-the-radar concern that's been designing a full-blown A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) super-chip for the last four years at home in our spare time that is so powerful that only a few of them combined will be more powerful than every supercomputer currently running in 2020.

This new custom-instruction-set supercomputer is a 2-THz, 128-bits wide 19.2 PetaFLOPs combined CPU/GPU/DSP/Array Processor that SURPASSES every single computer system available today and we will be burning the finished chip design onto GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) substrates (280 nanometre line traces) for 2-THz clock speed operations and we will be GIVING AWAY THESE Super-CPU/GPU/DSP/Array Processor chips FOR FREE TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE who wants one.

The massively-parallel Electron Beam etching system we are currently designing and building in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada will be able to print (i.e. burn!) over ONE MILLION Super-Chips PER DAY!

The chip itself is a STACKED multi-chip module where system RAM, general purpose CPU cores, RGBA/YCbCrA/HSLA GPU processing, Array/DSP processing, DAC/ADC, and General purpose I/O are on separate chiplet layers on a simple motherboard in a simple aluminum box that has multiple I/O ports on it so you can have all sorts of full-duplex communications and other Input/Output.

The entire system is about 2.5 litres (2500cc) in volume and needs no external fan-based cooling since a built-in FULLY-SEALED silicone oil-based thermal management system and cooling fins is part of the box! The system has been thermally tested for 24/7/365 operation at the full 2-THz and all I/O ports and sub-systems can be in use at the same time! TDP (Thermal Design Power) is 500 watts total at maximum usage (350 watts is typical).

For display, communications and storage drive ports, the following ports are built-in:

a) 16 Output DisplayPort 2.0 connectors that allow output (playback) of sixteen simultaneous up-to-DCI-8K resolution (8192 x 4320 pixels) streams of video at up to 16 bits per RGBA/YCbCrA pixel channel. (i.e. up to 64-bit colour!) so you can create 4x4 monitor video walls. Has Rec.2020, HDR10 and Rec.709 support with upgradable BIOS for eventual 64-bit colour output and 16k resolution.

b) 16 Input DisplayPort 2.0 connectors that allow input (recording) of sixteen simultaneous up-to-DCI-8K resolution (8192 x 4320 pixels) streams of video at up to 16 bits per RGBA/YCbCrA pixel channel. (i.e. up to 64-bit colour!) This means you can record 16 cameras at once! Has Rec.2020, HDR10 and Rec.709 support with upgradable BIOS for eventual 64-bit colour input and 16k resolution.

c) 8 eSATAp Connectors (powered external SATA/USB hybrid ports at up to 16-gigabits per second per port!) for attaching external SSD drives!

d) 8 powered USB-4 Ports at 40 gigabits per port (backwards compatible with USB 3.1)

e) 8 Ten Gigabit Ethernet RJ-45-style ports

f) 8 single-mode glass fibre connectors for up to one terabits per second per port (upgradable software-based protocols)

g) 16 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) BNC connectors (switchable between 3.3v and 5V and has Ground) connected to a combined ADAC (Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog processor) that does 32 bits per sample at up to 20 Gigasamples per second per port allowing sixteen channels of high-bandwidth software-defined radio (SDR) applications, motion control and high-resolution real-time data gathering and metadata export! It has two terabytes of input buffer and two terabytes of output buffer when using in typical configuration of 8 channels input and 8 channels output.

h) On each Super-Chip is 16 Terabytes of SHARED SYSTEM RAM between the 1024 cores (single threaded-per-core-only so there are 1024 total 128-bits wide hardware threads available!) Each of the 1024 cores has one gigabyte of L1 Cache and 2048 of local-to-current-core-only 128-bits wide on-the-fly renamable storage registers used for storing current operands, variables and local processing results.

i) There are 65,536 built-in full-hardware accelerated 128-bits wide signed and unsigned integer, floating point and fixed point math processing micro-cores which do full SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) array processing on arrays of integer and real numbers (up to 65,536 of 128-bits wide real or integer values at a time!). Has specialized hardware-accelerated array-like bitwise operations for long bit-length AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SPIN-BITS, FLIP-BITS, ROTATE-BITS, SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, PROTECT-BITS, SET-BITS, COPY-BITS, MOVE-BITS and REVERSE-BITS operations.

j) A separate 128-bits wide RGBA/YCbCrA/HSLA pixel GPU processing engine (32-bits per channel) has an independent-from-main-system-RAM 1000 frame STEROSCOPIC VIDEO BUFFER for up-to-1000-fps video playback from and 1000 fps video recording to 1000 of the stereoscopic 16,384 by 16,384 pixel frame buffer locations which saves a left-eye and right-eye frame at each buffer location – i.e. two 16k by 16k video frames plus audio samples. (16 Terabytes Total video buffer). It also has real-time Hardware accelerated convolution filters (with LUTs) such as accelerated 2D-XY and 3D-XYZ SOBEL Edge Detection, Hi-Pass and Lo-Pass filters, and 16k x 16k resolution hardware-based LANCOZ-3, LANCZOS-5, LANCZOS-7 Sin-C, Bilinear, Bicubic, pixel doubling and super-sampling upscale/downscale resize algorithms! Also has built-in single-frame and multi-frame visual colour/luminance filters, and distortion-oriented and multi-pixel-oriented special effects for still photos and video!

k) Two NVME M.2 slots for multi-terabyte internal flash drives.

l) Built-in software-defined GPS, Glonass, Beidou, Galileo receiver and 3D-XYZ MEMS-based accelerometer, 3D-XYZ rotation/orientation/compass sensor, external atmospheric/barometric pressure and wide-range temperature sensors. Also has upgradeable SDR-based Wi-Fi 802.11acnx transceiver system.

m) Everything in the box is Fully Canadian-designed and manufactured ENTIRELY in Canada of ONLY custom-built Canadian parts and software! The Boxes, Capacitors, Transformers, Connectors and even the Nuts and Bolts are ALL custom-designed-and-built entirely in Canada using Canadian-designed-and-built manufacturing systems and Canadian-built 5-axis CNC and 3D printing machines! All the software such as the assembler, compiler and custom-OS and toolbar applications are also fully Canadian designed and coded! This means it's all ITAR-free (i.e. NO U.S. sourced hardware components or software) for worldwide exportable applications!

---

As you can see, this is the WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL PROCESSING CHIP and it's only the size of a shoe box! You can use it for robotics, general purpose computing, CAD/CAM/FEA and Physics simulations plus scientific visualization, multi-million-instances of operating system virtual machines and a whole lot more!

Question: Why are we doing this?

Answer: We are going to unceremoniously disrupt ENTIRE INDUSTRIES and YOU the general public will be able to build entirely NEW industries with such computer horsepower at your disposal. We want to KNOW what YOU would do with such VAAAAAAST processing horsepower!

Question: So Why is it FREE ???

Answer: We happen to have ANOTHER set of technologies which are actually QUITE A BIT MORE IMPORTANT than this one, sooooooo we are going use this as a GIFT-TO-THE-WORLD and to prepare humanity for some rather Earth-shaking discoveries and STUNNING new technologies!

Question: Again, why are you doing this?

Answer: We want EVERYONE to have their own personal supercomputer to do whatever they want and we aim to give the public exactly that AT ZERO COST TO YOU! With our 30+ years of coding and design experience, we KNOW what programmers and hardware engineers WANT in their high-performance compute systems! And they are going to get THEIR DREAM SYSTEM at a NO COST other than shipping !!!

We are not here to make a profit. We are here TO GIVE EVERYONE A CHANCE to get their own supercomputer FOR FREE!

SO AGAIN with such MASSIVE computer processing power please discuss WHAT YOU WOULD DO WITH IT ????

Please Discuss Below:

1,"The Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach (1500+ rooms, worth $1bil+, \~$1mil in revenue daily) is undergoing a ransomware attack as we speak, and not one word in the media, the hotel won't tell guests anything about it.  

I have tried contacting everyone in the media I can (Miami Herald, Miami New Time, Krebs, Schneier, etc) and literally no one will respond, I think they think this is insane.

My understanding is that the credit card system at the Fontainebleau Hotel is hacked and being held for ransom.  My understanding is they have not issued hotel wide instructions, so some departments are ""cash only"" and other departments are swiping credit cards and storing it in the system, but it does not connect to your bank and they cannot authorize cards, or close out charges.  (I think they are hoping this will be resolved and then they can process all the saved credit cards later basically.)  My understanding is this happened some time between 9am-5pm on Thurs Jan 16th and they aren't telling guests anything, and the line to check in is crazy (because they cannot process credit cards like normal) - people are waiting up to 4 or 5 hours for rooms, and it is chaos.  There are people sitting all over the lobby with their luggage just waiting, are extremely angry, and they are not telling them anything.  And worst of all, they are still ""accepting"" credit cards in some departments (some of the restaurants for example) but aren't telling people in advance their credit card system is hacked, they are pretending everything is fine, even though it clearly is not.  They swipe your card, but you can check your account and see that it is not authorizing the card with your bank.  I do not know if the hackers are then able to see this additional credit card.  I do not know if they plan on paying the ransom.  ATMs on property have run out of cash (I do not know how often they are refilling them.)

No, I do not know how much they are asking in ransom.

I have literally no idea who to contact or how to do so.  So here I am on Reddit.  I am about to give up, everyone will find out in a few weeks I imagine.  All I know is a major convention is about to check in tomorrow (NATPE) and the Superbowl is a week later (1500 rooms at $1k+ per room/night), and they are literally unable to capture any credit card payments or collect any money at all (besides cash.)  All they will state is their credit card system is ""down.""  Also, their WIFI seems to be down.

Imagine if you were there swiping your credit card right now not knowing whether or not the hackers have access to these additional numbers, and the hotel isn't tell you, so you have no idea.

So, reddit, where is the best place to post this, or who should I contact before I give up?

1,"Yeah, I'm done.

I want to quit.

I've had it with the digital revolution, the smartphones, watches and whatever's next. Log-ins, passwords, pass phrases, dual level authentication, and never having a day away from work.

That's premise one -- digital gadgetry doesn't make life easier, it makes it harder, and gives us more work to do -- work just to operate our devices, which we use for both work and our leisure time (TV), and we have to work at our leisure time to make our devices operable (and just to freaking log in).

Taverns, restaurants lack real patrons with more delivery drivers waiting to take people their favorite bar food directly to their front door via an app on a smartphone, and coffee shops are filled like classrooms with youthful phone tappers and scratchers, which is probably why Starbucks has the Cool Jazz channel raised to concert-like decibels -- no one is speaking to each other anyway. Smartphone glow illuminates the concert, the play, the feature film, the wedding rehearsal dinner, and at the cinemabonplexapalooza. God damnit, why can't I see transformers transform without somebody's text ding interrupting the CGI stroke fest in front of me?!

That's premise two -- the way people interact with their devices has altered our culture from one of interaction and conviviality to one of avoidance, passivity alongside constant connectivity that borders on the annoying.

And about connection, calling is now considered ""rude"" even if it's a call to get a response on an e-mail that they avoided answering. And that's the overall paradox of the digital revolution -- a transformation from a society of wired connectivity and limited methods of information dispersal to a society in which constant, high tech communication and sharing and swapping of information is commonplace, routine, and happening at every moment. Yet this same digitized society is typically more worn out, less connected to human beings, tired, sick and more stupid than the people who inhabited our land before the digital revolution occurred. 

One would think with a constant stream of  information at our fingertips with complete connectivity virtually 24 hours a day, every day of the freaking year, that we'd be an overall better society. But we're not. We're worse. Zombies. Society has degenerated into one of tech gadget zombies, and an common expression of dazed infatuation is the default face of just about everyone we know.

Work -- it never ends, following us with our devices, on the freaking cloud -- it's always there. And overall, the digital revolution has killed certain jobs, like receptionist. Sure, it wasn't a great job, but it was a face and a voice to an organization, company, or institution (and I knew some receptionists who made a lot of money). Those hardly exist any longer, creating a technicratical disneyland of automated bureaucracy. It's amazing that business is still being conducted in the digital revolution, and even when money's on the line, it's still hard to get people to answer a freaking e-mail.

Everyone has probably heard of adfly by now. It's a very popular link shortener, which forces you to look at ads for 5 seconds before you can proceed to the destination link.

There's nothing wrong with that.

HOWEVER, adfly doesn't seem to give a sh*t about security of anyone:

1. Inappropriate ads. Adfly is displaying NSFW ads and nude content on their ""Wait for 5 seconds"" page.
This is especially a problem, since a lot of popular websites related to games (mostly the ones rated Pegi 0, like Minecraft) are still using adfly.
I just came across a comment section under a Minecraft tutorial. There were several kids (age 11/12?) who were apparently traumatised because they saw porn on adfly when wanting to download Optifine.

2. Hacking. Yeah, adfly (or there related redirecting page ""gloyah.{...}"") uses Network attacks and device penetration of some sort. I've experienced it myself:

When I had to redirect via adfly once, Norton suddenly beeped really loud and displayed a warning (something like ""Network attack. High Risk. Name: Fake Tech support...""). I've read before that this happens several times and there's some Adware, scamware etc. related to this.

3. Annoying Spam &amp; Unethical Ads. If you redirect via adfly, there's a good chance they will try to trick you into downloading a different programm. Older people won't know this and they'll probably end up with a virus the first time they'll come across adfly.

Adfly also uses the notification function and apparently several spam functions to further annoy you.

Conclusion:
This isn't tolerable anymore. Adfly needs to be stopped if they don't seriously change their business model. Everyone can try to use a bypass addon in chrome or Firefox, or atleast a good adblocker and antivirus/antiphishing tool.Adfly needs to be stopped (Network Hacking, displaying porn ads etc.)"

Now I bought a phone with another phone number to use. I have to manage client information and would like to know when a client calls and manage the information like who called, when they called, texts, etc.

Essentially a communication platform.

So I researched something like this and I found several examples of different companies using cloud to manage this information.

Right now I use a spreadsheet that lists all my clients with data like first and last name, email, address, etc. Is there some kind of core data software, like a core spreadsheet, in the cloud that connects with any communication platform that I choose? So when I update my core data set, for example, add a contact, it saves it to the core and then when I open my platform, it's already there since it's connected to the core.

I have experience with google sheets and excel but I don't know if anything connects to it. I could always export but then I have to double input information. You could say just use the platform to manage the information, but what if something comes up that needs this information and I have to export etc instead of connecting this platform to my core.

I'm not sure how to phrase it. Is there a way to have a live core data set on the cloud, that connects with various platforms? Like a communication platform for a business.Looking for Advice: Client and Phone Usage (inbound and outbound communication including calls, sms, etc) Data Management"

Author: Darryl Rosenblatt writes......

I wrote an article a couple of weeks ago about skill-based games. I've been tracking the performance of these games since they were introduced to the market a few years ago.

In this particular article, I mentioned a company called GameCo, and I referenced it's CEO, Blaine Graboyes.

After I published the article, I received an enormous amount of messages and emails.

These could be sorted into three piles.

First, there were the folks that completely agreed that skill based games are better suited in their own environment, where they don't have to compete with slots.

Second, there were the folks that thought I was crazy, and that I was being really harsh on Mr. Graboyes.

Third, there was a disproportionate amount of folks that wanted to talk to me about Mr. Graboyes himself.

Now, I am an amateur journalist. I like to say ""journalist"", because I like to think that I take more responsibility for what I publish, than say, a blogger.

However, I promise, If it weren't for spell-check, and a wife with a keen eye for grammar, you'd think this piece was authored by a fourth grader, whose English was a second language.

With that said, I don't want to talk about anyone.

But, the emails were persistent, and what was weird, is that these people were not crackpots.

Financiers, Angel Investors, GameCo Employees, Ex-GameCo Employees, former partners, engineers, even the ex-COO of GameCo had reached out to me, with what amounted to be, a plethora of allegations against Blaine Graboyes.

To say that these people were upset, would be like saying Steve Wynn liked to flirt.

These individuals described Blaine Graboyes as a man who treats the truth like a tree falling in the woods. If you can't see it, and you can't hear it, it simply didn't happen.

However, none of these things really had anything to do with the GameCo product, and despite numerous accusations to the contrary, the only thing I saw Blaine guilty of was bullshitting gaming operators, and an extremely confusing haircut.

That was until I got an email from an unassuming young man, who had quite a story, and he really wanted someone to tell it.

Justin's tale was tall, and my patience was short, and most importantly, I needed evidence.

It came in troves.

In fact, it was some of the most meticulous record keeping I had ever seen.

After reading hundreds of documents, multiple email chains, dozens of files, court filings, photographs, videos, corporate board recordings, schematics, patents, and interviewing the other people involved, I can say with absolute certainty, the GameCo story does not begin with Blaine Graboyes, and an epiphany, in New York City.

No alt text provided for this image
The story of GameCo begins in a small suburb of Toledo, Ohio called, Sylvania, and with a young competitive gamer named Justin Yamek.

Justin worked as a Journeyman during the day, and spent most of his free time playing video games.

Except, Justin’s free time wasn’t free. Gaming is an expensive hobby, and as accomplished as he was at playing video games, the equipment, travel, and upgrades, were almost unattainable on his carpenters salary.

Justin envisioned a privately held company that would run grassroots competitions for the mass market of “core gamers” by rewarding their participation while playing their favorite games on PC, consoles, social, and mobile.

No alt text provided for this image
Justin developed his concept to include the first video game casino. This would be the home for gamers, just like him, where the outside is built and branded to look like a video game console, with pulsing lights attracting visitors. All of the attractions are video game themed, the floors and rooms evoke game genres and characters, and the gambling is focused on video games.

No alt text provided for this image
Instead of slot machines, there are rows of individual gaming stations at which players can compete locally and online.


At the heart of this new Video Game Gambling casino concept was Justin’s new flagship product, the VGM, or Video Game Gambling Machine.

Designed specifically for younger players, The VGM is a single player, or multi-player gaming experience that allows players to gamble on the outcome of video games.

Justin envisioned these games to replace traditional slot machines, which often generate 60% to 75% of the $60bn/yr in U.S. gambling revenue.

Justin shared his idea with his brother-in-law,Tony Legeza, because he knew him to have experience in product development, and was aware that Mr. Legeza holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and had graduate Cum Laude from Eastern Michigan University.

Tony found merit in Justin’s concept and launched Beyond Gaming, LLC in July of 2009.

The original founders of Beyond Gaming, LLC were :  Anthony J. Legeza Jr. , Justin Yamek, Dan Gross, and Brandon Cohen.

The original board consisted of Tony Legeza, Justin Yamek, and Dan Gross, the new Chief Technology Officer for the company. 

In September of 2009, As one of his first official acts as CEO, Mr. Legeza successfully secured an IGNITE! Grant for Beyond Gaming in the amount of $37,500.00

Between 2009 and 2010 Tony Legeza, in his role as CEO, raised seed money (Angel) from family and friends in the approximate amount of $250,000.

In 2010, Tony Legeza, in his role as CEO, raised approximately $500,000 (Series A), through Rocket Ventures.

In September 2011, Tony Legeza, in his role as CEO raised $850,000 through WPSChallenger - Heli Holdings I Investment (Common B shares).

From 2013 - 2014 Beyond Gaming, LLC also was funded through a series of convertible debt notes from Challenger &amp; Rocket Ventures in excess of $1M.

Between October 2011- mid 2012 the corporate board for Beyond Gaming, LLC consisted of various principals of WPS Challenger.

At the request of Mr. Legeza, Robert Montgomery is brought onto the Board of Directors to replace Graeme Weston, whom Mr. Legeza felt was underperforming in his position on the board.

Robert Montgomery had a personal relationship with Challenger CEO &amp; Beyond Gaming Board Member, Bruce Steinberg, and convinces the board to bring in Blaine Graboyes - “An old friend with vast experience with Video Games”, into the business as a consultant. 

Blaine's ex-wife is originally from Toledo, Ohio so they eventually moved to Toledo, and rented a house from Mr. Legeza. 

In September 2012, Beyond Gaming, LLC began developing protypes for the VGM and presented Detroit Venture Partners &amp; Rock Gaming (Adam Suliman) ideas about a Video Game Casino and hardware/software solutions to put on the casino floor.

Tony Legeza resigned as CEO in November in 2012, and remained active with the company, as a paid consultant for five months, as Blaine Graboyes took the reigns as the CEO of Beyond Gaming, LLC.


Prototypes were rapidly being developed for the first VGM, conceptual renderings were being created for the Video Game Casino, and marketing materials were being designed by Beyond Gaming LLC, that focused primarily on the VGM and the Video Game Casino concept.

On December 11, 2013, the Beyond Gaming Platform debuted at a private event hosted by Rock Gaming in their offices in Detroit, Michigan. Players were able to experience the VGM and VGC concepts for the first time.

Blaine Graboyes attended this event.

No alt text provided for this image
The prototype was extremely well received, and there was enormous interest in seeing the next iteration of the machine.

It is the assertion of Yamek and Legeza, that it is during this event, that Blaine Graboyes decided that he was going to find a way to make this new video game gambling technology his own.

Four months later, in April 2014, Graboyes E-mails the future COO of GameCo, and friend of thirty years, Cinnamon Booth,

“This past year, I’ve developed a way to gamble playing video games at the casino. Our funders have run out of cash and I’ve negotiated to buy the company. Now I need to raise funds quickly to make this transition. Attached is a quick backgrounder. If interesting, I’d provide a NDA and support materials. The technology and business are ready to go - need the funding. Thought this may be a match for some of your contacts. Please lmk if you have time and I can walk through the opportunity.”

Graboyes enclosed a “Backgrounder” to his email, that duplicated all of Beyond Gaming’s content and replaced Beyond Gaming’s logo and branding with GameCo’s.

At this point, Graboyes is utilizing Beyond Gaming promotional material to raise money for his own company, (GameCo) without the permission or knowledge of Beyond Gaming, LLC. 

On or about May of 2014, with interest in Beyond Gaming’s concept at a fever pitch, Blaine Graboyes decides the company is insolvent, and spends the next several months trying to convince the board, that chapter seven bankruptcy is the only option moving forward, for Beyond Gaming.

Citing Beyond Gaming’s lack of cash, Blaine pushed for the bankruptcy for the benefit of the “creditors”, the two biggest creditors being Blaine Graboyes and Robert Montgomery, for what they have claimed, but have failed to prove, were for unpaid wages.

Of important note, save for Montgomery and Graboyes’s unsubstantiated claims for unpaid wages, which were never proven, There were high net-wealth individuals at the time willing to put forward the seed capital to further Beyond Gaming, LLC, and several offers were formally presented to the Board of Directors which were ultimately ignored &amp; expired.

To accept any offers proffered by suitors of Beyond Gaming, Blaine Graboyes would have to forfeit his plan to start his own company using Beyond Gaming’s proprietary technology.

Neither Graboyes, nor Montgomery, had anything to lose, because they already had a plan in place to purchase the technology from Beyond Gaming, and dump the debt in Bankruptcy Court.

As such, Graboyes presented a plan to the board that would purposely omit Beyond Gaming’s IP assets from the chapter 7 filing, leaving them unencumbered, so that Blaine Graboyes could purchase them directly from Beyond Gaming, LLC. 

This was essential in order for Blaine to legally launch GameCo, utilizing Beyond Gaming’s work product.

Rocket Ventures was willing to fund Graboye’s GameCo venture, provided that the IP was purchased from Beyond Gaming, LLC.


On June 4th 2014, Graboyes drafted a purchase agreement between GameCo and Beyond Gaming, LLC, confirming and identifying specific intellectual property, owned by Beyond Gaming, LLC, and to be conveyed to GameCo.

These assets were listed in the agreement as:

Schedule 1.1: Certain Identified Purchase Assets

Prototype Software
SwayZ Software
Cabinet Prototype
Pelican Prototype
Math Model (Excel spreadsheet)
VGM White Paper
Executive Summary documents


What Graboyes did not anticipate, was Beyond Gaming’s complete and total rejection of his offer.

Beyond Gaming’s refusal to accept Graboyes’s offer was simple, and three-pronged.

First, Blaine would continuously refer to himself as the inventor, and or pioneer of the technology, and Beyond Gaming, LLC sought recognition for their work in the space. 

Second, it was evident that Graboyes was abusing his position as CEO of Beyond Gaming, LLC, and manipulating the future of the company, to his benefit, without respect to members of Beyond Gaming, LLC.

And third, the gross inequity of the agreement presented.

Beyond Gaming could not see leaving their original investors with nothing.

Blaine was walking away with 80% of the new business and 100% of the Beyond Gaming assets.

Considering he had 0% ownership of Beyond Gaming, LLC, this agreement seemed ridiculous.

Plus, it was become evident in hindsight, that Blaine was promising positions in the newly formed GameCo company to people on the board, if they supported his chapter seven scheme.

Unable to strike a deal with Beyond Gaming, LLC , Rocket Ventures and Challenger pursued, and eventually funded the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, leaving Blaine Graboyes unemployed.

Blaine Graboyes left Beyond Gaming, LLC and took all the physical, and intellectual property assets of the company with him, including the VGM prototype.

Graboyes unexpected change of fortune left him in a panic, as evidenced in an email to his friend Cinnamon Booth on July 29, 2014,

“I’ve had to pass on the funding in Ohio. I’m now absolutely desperate for work. Will consider and pitch for any opportunities anywhere. Remaining focused on GameCo but need to hustle to stay alive.
Will share more next time we talk.”
Between September and November 2014, Blaine Graboyes and Robert Montgomery began rebranding all of the Beyond Gaming, LLC marketing assets into GameCo.




While it was relatively simple to simply replace the Beyond Gaming Logo on promotional materials, it was an entirely different thing to duplicate the demo software in the Beyond Gaming VGM prototype.

Whereas, Blaine had the code, he had absolutely no idea at the time what to do with it.

On December 14, 2014, Blaine emailed Cinnamon Booth and Robert Montgomery, he had a breakthrough!

""Here’s a quick update on the situation. I’ve hacked the demo such that it’s usable but still broken.""
There are two main issues:
• The game does not display full screen (you can see edges)
• The “Bank” is not working properly (shows wrong amount)""
It’s not worth trying to debug this further. I want to focus on making a new, slicker demo.
We will still use TrackMania as the core game.
""The work on the maps is what’s really essential.
Everything else is just reporting data - the maps are the key!!""
No alt text provided for this image


The “demo” Graboyes references in his email, is the demo game featured in the stolen VGM. Trackmania is the game that features Beyond Gaming’s proprietary mapping technology and utilizes SwayZ Software (also proprietary to Beyond Gaming), to determine a player’s time versus the optimal path around the track to determine payout.

Trackmania was the game featured in the VGM presented to Rock Gaming in Detroit.

The mapping technology utilized in Trackmania are literally, and figuratively, the principal claims of the ‘282 and ‘138 patents prosecuted by GameCo.

No alt text provided for this image
The patents filed by Graboyes and GameCo feature a photograph and sketch of the VGM prototype stolen from Beyond Gaming, LLC.

GameCo also copied the Beyond Gaming, LLC RTP weighting index, and smacked that on their patent as well.

The white-paper on the VGM authored, and subsequently stolen by Graboyes, when he couldn’t come to terms with Beyond Gaming, LLC, mirrors the claims of the GameCo patents almost identically.

From January 2015 to present, Blaine Graboyes and Robert Montgomery have used the stolen assets of Beyond Gaming, LLC to build GameCo. 

GameCo has since raised over $56,000,000 in private investment per CrunchBase (https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gameco-llc)

Mr. Graboyes, as CEO, pays himself $350,000 a year, and Mr. Montgomery is listed on the GameCo website as Chairman. 

Mark Sinosich, the mathematician contracted by Beyond Gaming, LLC, to develop the Math Model for the VGM White-Paper is listed as one of the inventors of GameCo’s patent.

Interestingly, Beyond Gaming, LLC is mentioned - nowhere.

The reason that this is the case, is because Yamek and Legeza were afraid to sue GameCo, because Graboyes made it clear, it would be the type of litigation that could cost them their homes. Their homes, where their children live.

People like Blaine Graboyes, who are a slap away from singing show-tunes on command, are in no position to bully anyone.

The fact that this gonif has been allowed, even encouraged, to pollute the space with his endless parade of bullshit is an embarrassment to our industry, an insult to true innovators, and an enormous black eye on the Great State of Nevada.

We reached out to Blaine Graboyes directly and through his attorney. They had no comment at the time of publication.

There’s still a lot we don’t know about the device, including price or many of its features, but there are a few things we can speculate about from this one image. It looks like you can use the watch to make and receive calls. And if you look at the watch on the right, it looks like there’s an option to send a message to the caller if you aren’t able to take their call.

The watches themselves also look *slightly* different than the Apple Watch. While the body of the Oppo Watch appears to be pretty similar in shape to the Apple Watch, there’s no knob that could function like the Apple Watch’s Digital Crown — instead, the [Oppo Watch](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21162153/oppo-watch-series-new-smartwatch-looks-just-like-apple#) has a second and larger button similar to other WearOS devices. The watch on the left also comes in a nice blue color, which isn’t an option for the Apple Watch. And the bands look a little different than those you can get for Apple’s wearableOppo's New Launched Watch Just Look Like Apple's Watch."

1,"Hello r/technology Sub-Reddit, my name is Alexander R. Gieraltowski. I am currently eighteen years old and live in Downtown Manhattan, New York City. I am also the Founder &amp; Chief Executive Officer of the Settlement Defense Federation, a Decentralized Government Corporation. I have been developing this company for the past three years, ranging from planning financial strategies to developing software needed. A few days ago I releases a very brief summary of what the Settlement Defense Federation is and plans to accomplish; 

""The Settlement Defense Federation is a Decentralized Government Corporation, a Sovereign State, Comprised of Multiple Subsidiaries Operating in Various Market Sectors. In Accordance with Maritime-Law &amp; with the Articles of the Law of the Sea, the Settlement Defense Federation Seeks to Operate a Sea-Based Micro State 12 nautical miles Off the Coast of Manhattan &amp; Long Island, New York, U.S. The Settlement Defense Federation Strives to Ensure the Continuing Stability &amp; Security of the United States Economy through the Implementation of Efficient &amp; Effective Economic Practices, Additionally Supported by the Research &amp; Development of Advanced Technological Systems with the Capability of Accelerating the Modernization of the United States as a Whole. Externally the Sea-Based Micro State of the Settlement Defense Federation will be Comprised of Multiple Floating Platforms I.e. Retired Aircraft Carriers Upgraded &amp; Outfitted to Support the Operations of the SDF State. Citizens of the SDF Micro State will Operate within its Personal Jurisdiction while Still Being Subject to Certain U.S. Laws.""

To me, that is the briefest summary I could write that respectively got my initial point across of describing what the Settlement Defense Federation is. So anyway, I have been developing this business for the past three years and I am now at the point in time where I am ready to start raising capital through public contributions... and well, It has not been going well. I have been trying to raise capital for the past 4 months and have literally raised nothing, not a single penny. I am getting to the point where working on this business is becoming painful, I put all this time and effort In and have not been able to convince anyone in the potential this business has, enough to the point that they would make a donation / contribution. Developing this business is all I do, roughly twelve hours per day. So yeah, thank you for reading this, if you have any ideas for me and/or questions, feel free to comment them below.

Thank you for your time,

Greetings! I work for a start-up that builds technology for animal welfare. We have built a web application that makes it easy for rescues and shelters to foster out animals temporarily [RescueFoster.com](https://RescueFoster.com). Check us out and I'd appreciate any feedback. This app gives shelter staff an opportunity to use something better than spreadsheet and thick paper binders when it comes to figuring out what animal can go to what homes they already have available.

The honest truth is that if more people like you and me took in cats and dogs on a temporary basis less animals would be put down. We need more rescues and shelters to sign up, our goal is one rescue or shelter in every state by the end of the year. No animal is more grateful than the one you pull out of a kennel. Even an overnight sleepover at a foster home reduces ""shelter stress"" that these animals get at overcrowded animal shelters. Animals are infinitely more adoptable in and after foster care.

1,"Having a wide range of applications in [**Intellectual Property**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/) (IP) regimes of several countries worldwide, Geographical Indication (GI) is a sign, symbol, or name used on products to indicate that they have originated from a specific geographical locality and possess qualities, characteristics, and reputation attributable to their origin. GI not just functions as quality marks that improve export markets and revenues but also provides a precise source of origin. In this way, it prevents unauthorized users or manufacturers from manufacturing and selling fake products, i.e., products that don’t meet the applicable standards in regards to that origin. For instance, as Darjeeling tea holds a GI tag, its producers have a complete right to prevent the use of the term Darjeeling for the tea products, which are either not produced as per the standards set by the GI law or not grown in their jurisdictions. Though geographical indication protection doesn’t provide the right to prevent others from using the same technique or procedure to manufacture products similar to those that have been granted GI tags, yet it is beneficial in protecting unauthorized use of sign, symbol, or a name that constitutes indication.

Now, if we talk about the designation of origin, it refers to a special kind of protection and implies exclusive or essential natural and human factors of the geographical environment leading to specific characteristics and quality of products and services. It grants protection to the names or signs indicating that a product or service originates from a specific geographical region.

**Why Should Geographical Indications and Designation of Origin be protected?**

Protection of GIs and designation of origin under the [**Intellectual Property Law**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/) is crucial to evade unauthorized use and infringement. Prevention of such unlawful use will ultimately contribute to increasing the commercial value and reputation of the products and services. Moreover, it also benefits the general public and consumers. For instance, by promoting good business practices and fair market competition, protected GIs will help the customers to buy the precise products. Furthermore, by retaining the active workforce and stimulating family farms, especially in rural areas for developing specific and traditional products and services, the protection of these signs is favorable to economic development as well.

**How Should the Protection of Geographical Indications be granted?**

The protection of GIs under IP should be granted through a relevant registration procedure. GIs are often protected under national laws and following a wide range of concepts, like laws for the protection of certification marks, laws against unfair competition, consumer protection laws, or special laws for the protection of geographical indications or designations of origin. The [**Geographical Indication Protection**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/geographical-indication) provides the owner with the right to prevent third parties from using the authorized indication on or for the products or services that do not conform to the applicable standards and can be obtained by acquiring right over the sign or name that constitutes the indication. Once registered, the GI and designation of origin may be used collectively by any of the producers (who meet the requirements) from the specific locality.

Contrary to other sorts of [**Intellectual Property Rights**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/) (IPRs) like a trademark, patent, [**Industrial Design**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/industrial-design), and more, the legal systems taking care of this field may differ from state to state. One other considerable fact about geographical indication or designation of origin is that these are often used with producers’ sign or logo that can be protected under trademark with a perspective to focus on the individual character and common characteristics of products’ origin.

Protection of GI tags and designation of origin not just prohibits infringement issues but also builds a remarkable reputation worldwide. It then motivates the consumers to buy the GI products, along with visiting the regions where these commodities are being produced or made, and that ultimately benefit both the producers and nations by enhancing the tourism of those areas. **For more visit:** [**https://www.trademarkmaldives.com**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/)

I knew it would hurt me more in the long run, so you don’t need to reply block me need be. I’m just sorry. “ 

he replied within minutes. it’s been weeks since we’ve talked, i’m not sure why it was me who texted first. probably just because i was tipsy, upset, and letting the holidays get to me. But when he replied saying i have nothing to be sorry about and we should see eachother, i blocked him. not sure why. just did. ill be okay with time, i told him i needed lots of it.

First time digital currency backed by neutral and sustainable internet capacity

*THREEFOLD TOKEN (TFT)*
ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. TFT is listed on the exchange BTC-Alpha and BitMex. Based on funding round for the TDE Three Fold will contract with 3 (or more) exchanges based in Europe.(Coinsbit, P2PB2B, Shortex)
  
*THE THREEFOLD GRID*
ThreeFold Grid is an alternative to centralized cloud providers – a global, neutral, and sustainable network of autonomous storage and compute Internet capacity created by ThreeFold Farmers, with more than 80,000 TB and 14,000 cores existing today. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost.

1,"Hi all, sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. If you know of somewhere more appropriate, please let me know.

I, like everyone else in the developed world, am dependent on mobile technology: my smartphone and my smart watch follow me all day every day. I'm also pretty frustrated about how the industry is designed to push me towards buying the newest, shiniest, technology every year. I like cool tech, but I don't want to have to buy new shit every year to keep up.

Specifically, I've got a samsung galaxy watch that I really love. About 6 months ago it asked me to update it, and when I did I was greeted with fancy emojis and animations that now accompany me during my daily activities. This by itself is not upsetting, but those little animations take processing power, and its little things like that, every couple of months, that cause the mobile technology to become sluggish and ineffective over time. If I just give in, and update my watch every time they ask, I'll be buying a new smartwatch next year.  
Also, google maps. Its excellent gps software, but over the last year or two, its started becoming much more than that, with recommendations for activities and dozens of cool new features. I would actually be satisfied with a basic gps software, that didn't require 4-8gb of ram to run smoothly.

I'm tired of the cycle that's pushing me to consume more! I've got a few questions.

1) can I change any settings on my s7 phone to not prompt new updates for my watch? Will it eventually auto-update?

2) It will be time for me to update my phone in the near future. I know that some updates are more important than others, and I probably can't ignore all of them outright, but is there a way to use smartphones in a somewhat normal way without accepting all of the bloat that comes from updates? 

3) Has anyone made a modular smartphone yet? One that I can update gradually, instead of just outright replacing?

3) Is there maybe a subreddit out there full of people like me that are trying to hide from the constant push to consume more? There have to be specific strategies that people can follow to use modern technology, while avoiding the cycles of planned obsolescence.

Thanks! Hope this didn't come off as too rant-y.Help avoiding planned obsolescence in mobile tech"

Isn't the act of learning from a creation part of intelligence, regardless of what materials are used?

Because everything is made up of the same thing organic or not.

If we are artificial or in a simulation, doesn't that mean the ones creating it could be in a simulation as well?

Relatively speaking we have only existed in this universe for a blink of its eye.

We missed 14 billion years of it's life and trillions of lives of other solar systems.

All with their own planets and life, big and small.

The chances of us being the very thing we create is higher than the chance of us being the first ones to do it.

At the end of the day we will never know for sure because answers always lead to more questions.

1,"In 2007, when I was 18, I worked for an electrical retailer here in the UK. It was exciting. The first iPhone was just about to be released, the Xbox 360 and PS3 were miles ahead of the Xbox and PS2, and TVs were bigger, HD resolution but slimmer and were no longer big heavy glass boxes.

Most amazingly, laptops had become cheaper, more powerful and even a £500 laptop was higher specification and much better than a 5 year old desktop which originally cost £1500.

The one laptop I remember most was the one I bought. A HP Pavillon, 15” WXGA screen (1280x800), Dual Core AMD Turion 64-bit mobile processor, 4GB RAM, 320GB hard drive, DVD burner and even a remote control. All for just under £500.

13 years prior to that, in 1994, our family desktop computer was a 486 33MHz, 8Mb RAM, 512k Trident VGA graphics card, no sound card, a 640x480 15” CRT and Windows 3.11. Oh, and the CD-ROM drive was single speed. The cost? About £800 and that was *cheap* at the time (£1,400 in 2020 money?)

So you can see the HUGE change in specifications after 13 years between 1994 and 2007.

But now, in 2020, 13 years after I bought my first brand new laptop, the specifications of laptops in the same price range have barely changed! It’s almost impossible to find a laptop under £500 with more than 4GB of RAM, hard drives have been replaced by SSDs but the storage is still around 500GB, processor speeds are similar and the number of cores is either 2 or 4, and many laptops now don’t have an optical drive (saving the manufacturers on parts).

The pace of technological innovation has ground to a halt.Laptops haven’t advanced for 13 years"

1,"*From [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/12/police-struggle-to-keep-up-with-explosion-of-online-child-abuse)


*End-to-end encryption of messages will make it far more difficult for the police to prevent and detect online abuse, the report warns, adding “regulation of the internet industry is now required”.*


Social media companies should be forced to pre-screen all uploaded material to help law enforcement agencies cope with the “explosion” in online child sexual abuse in the UK, a critical report says.

The UK is identified as the third-biggest consumer in the world of the livestreaming of abuse in the 114-page study by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA).

Published at the end of the inquiry’s hearings into internet-facilitated exploitation, the report says social media companies appear motivated to “avoid reputational damage” rather than prioritising protection of victims.

It calls for the industry to be legally required to pre-screen all uploaded material and adopt more stringent age-verification techniques for users.

End-to-end encryption of messages will make it far more difficult for the police to prevent and detect online abuse, the report warns, adding “regulation of the internet industry is now required”.

While enforcement efforts have reduced the global proportion of child sexual imagery on UK websites, the report notes, that has not hampered ease of access. Indecent photographs of children can still be reached “from common search engines in only three clicks”.

Chief constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for child protection and abuse, has described the UK as “the third greatest consumer in the world of the live streaming of abuse”.

Since 2016, as many as 450 people a month are being arrested in the UK for abuse-related offences. “Despite technological advances to detect and prevent online child sexual abuse,” the study says, “law enforcement is struggling to keep up.”

As many as half a million men may have watched indecent images of children online, it is believed.

The IICSA is scathing in its criticism of social media companies, finding that “responses appeared reactive rather than proactive; action seemed driven by a desire to avoid reputational damage rather than to prioritise protection of children”.

It added: “We are unconvinced that internet companies fully understand the scale of the problem of livestreaming on their platforms such that they can properly assess whether they employ sufficient numbers of moderators to detect such offending.”

They need to ensure “there are sufficient numbers of human moderators with a specific focus on online child sexual abuse and exploitation”, the report states. “The value of human moderation is evident from the success achieved by the social network Yubo, whose moderators interrupt livestreams to tell underage users to put their clothes on.”

Online grooming appears to be increasing, with up to 10 grooming offences a day, according to research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). “Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are frequently named as the most common platforms where grooming takes place,” the report says.

The risks have become more widespread because the majority of UK children own a smartphone from around the time they start secondary school. “Although industry companies either prohibit or discourage children under 13 years old from accessing their platforms or services, the age verification process can be often easily subverted – simply by inputting a false date of birth,” the IICSA says.

“Children aged under 13 years old need additional protection. The industry must do more than rely on children to supply their true age when signing up to a platform. There must be better means of ensuring compliance with the current age restrictions.

“The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) frequently encounters images of livestreams which involve children from western backgrounds, the majority of whom are girls aged between seven and 13 years old.”

The sums paid to watch and in some cases direct the abuse are trivial. Sometimes it costs little more than a pound. The IWF has helped reduce illegal content on UK websites.

In one of its main recommendations, the report states: “The government should introduce legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on all relevant devices.”

From September this year, schools will have to include compulsory education in both primary and secondary schools that will help teach children about the need to stay safe online.

Prof Alexis Jay, the chair of the inquiry, said: “The serious threat of child sexual abuse facilitated by the internet is an urgent problem which cannot be overstated.

“Despite industry advances in technology to detect and combat online facilitated abuse, the risk of immeasurable harm to children and their families shows no sign of diminishing.

“Internet companies, law enforcement and government [should] implement vital measures to prioritise the protection of children and prevent abuse facilitated online.”

The report makes four recommendations for action the government should take to tackle online abuse:

* Requiring industry to pre‐screen material before it is uploaded to the internet to prevent access to known indecent images of children.

* Pressing the WeProtect global alliance to take more action internationally to ensure countries hosting indecent images of children implement legislation and procedures to prevent access.

* Introducing legislation requiring providers of online services and social media platforms to implement more stringent age verification techniques on devices.

* Publishing, without further delay, the interim code of practice in respect of child sexual abuse and exploitation as proposed by the online harms white paper (published April 2019).

The IWF, a UK-based charity responsible for finding and removing child sexual abuse material online, is a core participant in the inquiry.

Responding to the report, Susie Hargreaves, the IWF’s chief executive, said: “There is no longer any reason not to be decisive on taking action against the predators who exploit and abuse children online. This report makes it abundantly clear there is no room for excuses. The internet industry and the government need to step up and tackle this head on.”

Andy Burrows of the NSPCC, said: ““This report is a damning indictment of big tech’s failure to take seriously their duty to protect young people from child abuse, which has been facilitated on their platforms on a massive scale.

“That’s why the UK must lead the way with world-leading regulation that forces industry to acknowledge the inconvenient truth that they are putting children at risk.”Inquiry calls for web pre-screening to end UK child abuse 'explosion'"

1,"So my parents have Suddenlink which they currently have a bundle for. The bundle of internet, landline phone and cable is $142 (phone $15, cable $72.64 and internet $54.99) per month total but, they keep raising the prices. About 2 years ago they were paying $134 per month. By the way, this is the regular price, not a sale price that they've been paying. The taxes and fees keep increasing and they're paying $189 per month total now. Suddenlink said that if they drop the cable it would be $103 per month for just the internet and phone and that's before taxes estimate!! I'm uncertain why phone that's $15 and internet that's $54.99 per month would increase to $103! That would be $40 of taxes/fees!

The other options they have are: AT&amp;T, DirectTV and Dish. I believe Suddenlink is the best option if they want this bundle. Suddenlink is ripping them off with price increaes but looking at the amount of download speed and the prices after these sales prices these other companies have Suddenlink's price is the best. Suddenlink gives them 5 mbps upload and 50 mbps download. I don't think they have 100 channels on TV though.

I mentioned that they could just have internet and phone with suddenlink and stream using firestick but seeing as how suddenlink's increasing prices, idk what to tell them.What are my parents best options for Internet Service Providers in a small town?"

Necessity is the mother of invention. The root of all the technology and its applications emerges from human needs. The same is with the ""PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor"", and PiXL Document Reader"". The idea of these two products arises from our financial sector client's needs. The 

# The story begins here...

We are in a time where the technologies enable machines to simulate and augment human intelligence. Banking sectors are also inside the circle of intelligence age or else within a short time we can see a drastic change in financial services especially in manual works. They are the world of computers and networks that store the world economy in databases. PixDynamics had a trusted relationship with a prominent bank where they find difficulties in KYC form extraction and classification. Banks are the place where they handle a bulk of paper documents. We have to submit our proofs say Adhar cards, voters ID or any other means of Id proofs. This had to be entered into the system by a bank employee. Imagine how difficult it is to do these works manually. This is a practice that had been followed for years. Even though we address banks are in the path of AI, a lot of manual works are still an ongoing process. This gives us the idea of ""PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor"", and PiXL Document reader "". Our developing team developed the product under DL and ML proficiency. After implementing the product our client bank classify and extracts the documents with less time and thus gets the documents scanned with 99 percent accuracy. And now we had a trusted relationship with a couple of banks where they realize the product's efficiency and quality.

It was a hard work of one and a half years effect within the hands of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. The flow of the project was 

**Data collection -&gt; Train the system -&gt; Optimization**

The first real step to train our system is **gathering data**. This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that you gather will directly determine how good your predictive model can be. A few hours of measurements later, we have gathered our training data. Now it’s time for the next step of machine learning: **Data preparation**, where we load our data into a suitable place and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. Now we move onto what is often considered the bulk of machine learning — the T**raining**. In this step, we will use our data to incrementally improve our model’s ability to predict whether a given drink is wine or beer. Once training is complete, it’s time to see if the model is any good, using **Evaluation**. This is where that dataset that we set aside earlier comes into play. Evaluation allows us to test our model against data that has never been used for training.

People think that merely covering visible camera solves anything.  
They can build them into anything, from computer display to TV, notebook, tablet or even a smartphone.

This thing looks like purposefully built option for every module:

* it has to be very thin, so it uses fresnell lens
* since it is between LCD and backlight, it is flooded with visible light, so it mostly operates in IR spectrum
* if space permits, it can have IR flash (LED)
* it can have NFC communication side\_channel as main, only or additional channel
* usually  that secondary channel is NFC. It can be  triggered by a coded pulse  and its signal is meant to be received with Software Defined Radio or  similar device. There is usually no space for purpose transmitter &amp;  antenna, so the chip uses what it has, usually some traces that are laid  in available space.
* if/when given equipment doesn’t support such spycam as manufactured, simple unit can be built-in afterwards.
* it can capture video through main channel and snaps through secondary channel
* capturing  video and photos in well\_lit environment seems seamless, without any  visible disturbance. For usage of the built-in flash, it seems to have  to transition to all black frame momentarily.
* it can have complete sensor set. Along with video, it can capture audio, temperature, movement (MEMS) etc.

Is  there a good GPS app to install on family member's phones to track  their movements but secretly? Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking but  this is for very old people to make sure they're not lost and also don't  surprise me when they come to visit. :)

1,"Hello everyone 👋

My name is Dan Zaitsev and I’m the founder and co-maker of Catchar [https://catchar.io/](https://catchar.io/). Today, I would like to showcase to you our side-project that we are bootstrapping at our own. 

Catchar 2.0 is the world's largest community and hub where developers and companies build, share and support the best Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality projects that change the ways we interact with digital content and information. In addition, Catchar can help in terms of business opportunities and collaboration with AR creators.

BTW, today we are also presenting Catchar on Producthunt [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/catchar-2-0](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/catchar-2-0) and I would highly appreciate it if you can support us, leave your review and 🔼

About me/us

I’m a product (startup) maker and entrepreneur from Ukraine. Actually I’m not a developer but I know how to code a little bit on React.JS, Node, PHP, Wordpress, etc. I have more mixed experience (around 12 years) in product / project management, growth hacking &amp; classic marketing, UX design, monetization and bootstrapping the startups / products. Previously, I was working on a number of different startups and full-time based tech companies. In 2019, I met Dmitriy Zolotar, he is our CTO &amp; hacker now and Sergey Lagodzinsky, our hipster and lead designer. 

Story and challenges 🙇‍♂️

I started Catchar 1.5 years ago as a side-project and was the solo-founder during the first year. One friend of mine helped me to build the basic MVP based on React.js. The first version was a simple, curated directory where users were able to share their projects. I’ve got some transactions and feedback but honestly, the first 4 to 8 months were very tough for me. First of all, it was difficult in terms of activity and traffic, secondly, I had a lack of features and resources. I even tried to learn React.js and Node.js to improve the core features but had no time to mix marketing, management, design and also do my full-time job. Anyway, I didn't stop working on marketing, SEO and AR content. Also, I was talking to users to get feedback and collect more XR projects. I felt that I had problems in PMF so I was looking and thinking about new ideas for Catchar.

Changes and profit 🚀

In 2019 I came up with an idea to transform Catchar into a community-based startup/project. In summer 2019 I met my new co-founders and we have started working on the 2.0 version. Our main goal was to build something for AR/MR creators and be more focused on people rather than on projects. And this worked well. Also, I jumped into Startupschool by YC and it helped me to change my mindset a little bit. The first positive feedback was received when we got a spike of pre-registrations for the 2.0 version and our first donations. 

Business model and investments 💰

Catchar is still a 100% self-funded project that we support at our own expense, along with donations and the profit from business users. In terms of the business model, we ask AR/MR creators and companies to pay once for the membership fee to be listed on Catchar. In addition, they will unlock their profiles and as a result, have the ability to create online portfolios. Basic users are able to use the product for free but they don’t have profiles. 

How much we spend per month:

* Support - $140/mo (I have a friend of mine who works with us on a part-time basis. He helps us in terms of moderating the community properly)
* Hosting - $0/mo (Trial by Google Cloud Platform)
* Content - $50/mo (Proofreading of EN articles, posts, etc.)
* SEO - $300/mo (We are also working with 1 guy who helps us in terms of SEO)

How much I spent in one year

Currently, I’m investing in Catchar with my own funds. Please note I’m not an investor but it’s necessary in terms of supporting, marketing, etc. So, if someone thinks that they can build a startup or side-project with 0 investment, I would say it’s possible but will be difficult. During the last year and 3 months, I have invested around $1,529. 

Revenue

Until today we have earned approx $976. We achieved this during the last 3 months after the launch of Catchar 2.0 with a connected payment gateway. Unfortunately, the first version of Catchar wasn’t connected to a PG and it was tough for me to monetize it.

Traffic and stats

Currently, we have up to 400-700 unique visitors per day but we hope to double this number after the global launch. Around 50% of traffic is coming organically with the other 50% through direct and social media channels. I’ve worked a lot on SEO and have been writing tons of content and posts. In 2020 SEO is going pretty hard.

Our tech stack

Website is written on PHP and Javascript, using Laravel framework for back-end and Vue.js on the public. Server instance has Ubuntu 18 and MySQL 5.7 database. We use Redis for caching and Pusher for broadcasting events. For the instant notifications we have connected Mailgun service. Payments are going through Stripe. Hosted everything on GCP.

Some recommendations:

Below, I’ve decided to share some recommendations that might help you to build something quickly. Please note, maybe in your case they wouldn’t work. Also, I think I will use the same tactics for my next ideas / startups / side-projects. 

* Work on PMF and talk to users first! I would say you even don’t need to have a product to prove PMF. Simple start from a .pdf presentation or landing page and send it to your potential users / customers.
* Founders &amp; Co-founders. I think guys this is the biggest challenge to find the right co-founders / people, if you can’t build a project / startup as the solo-founder. I have had a few dead startups due to co-founders that weren’t able to finish them or they just passed out. Think twice and work only with open-minded people who will be on the same page with you.
* GO with crowdsourcing! I’ve found that some guys such as Pieter Levels (founder of Nomadlist) are doing amazing projects and products with crowdsourced databases. It will help you in terms of content.
* Start from PoC and MVP. Don’t try to build a Maximum Viable Product if your product has PMF, people will use it anyway.
* Monetize. I would say you have to monetize your products and ideas ASAP. Integrate any payment gateways as soon as you can. One of the best will be Stripe and Braintree but Gumroad, Paddle and Paypal will work for PoC too. With monetization you will get a picture of whether your idea / product makes sense and users are ready to pay for it. In addition, you and your co-founders will get +100 on the motivation scale when you receive your first payment or check.
* Marketing, talk and scale. Don’t think that users and customers will come by themselves. This will never happen. You have to take them by the hand and bring them to your product. 
* No code? Thanks to Bubble, Webflow and Carrd, makers are able to build something fast and good. If you are the solo-founder with limited coding skills, those products would definitely help you.
* Community and growth hack. You know guys, one of the most important things is to find your growth hack and build a community around yourself (or your product). I still have challenges in terms of building community around myself, since I don’t have enough time to write posts on Medium, share stories to Twitter, etc. But if you create something cool and useful YOUR USERS will definitely help you and support you! Actually, if you create a community around yourself then you can launch and scale almost any ideas and projects.

I hope that you found this post useful.

Good luck with your ideas and projects.

Anyways, I started a new subreddit called [r/techgays](https://www.reddit.com/r/techgays/) for folks that are gay to chat about all things tech.

Being 31M ([photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/lsnbe8f)) new to San Francisco this past year, it's been a struggle developing a strong friends circle, so I am really excited to build a community with fellow gay guys like me interested in connecting over technology here on Reddit.

1,"When can we expect to see a new revolutionary design in cooling for our smartphones that will allow us to do very intensive and heavy tasks without thermal throttling? 

Unfortunately, most smartphones are built very compact with little room for airflow. I know that since phone companies are trying to make our phones water resistant but it is at the sacrifice of our phones hardware breathing.

Vaper chamber and liquid cooling are effective to a certain degree but I'm more interested in something that will keep our phones at a constant and sustained level of performance. Something that isn't hindered by our phone cases either. 

Something that can...instead of forcing heat out of the metal of our phones, it has a chemical that turns something warm instantly cold. A liquid substance that can be put in a copper chamber that won't evaporate but instead can be used as a chemical reaction.

The chemical can circulate through the tube and as it gets hit with the heat of the CPU/GPU and Ram, it starts to forcefully cool the area that the heat is most prominent. 

Think of something that is almost like LN2 (Liquid Nitrogen) but only activates as such under extreme heat. Maybe not literally as cold as ln2 because that would most like cause damage somewhere.

Year 2020, I hope to see better cooling for our smartphones.Revolutionary Cooling (Smartphones)"

# What do I need exactly? Mobile Printer I am thinking.

📷

So this is probably a really easy question but i have been stomped and looking and asking a lot of places! Ok to the question im looking for something that can easily print out receipts/invoices on the go and will keep a log of everything each place gets.

At the moment our delivery driver goes to each store selling different kinds of pretzels and writes out each place a receipt example would be like two soft pretzels salted cost 2.00 I am trying to get him a device he can carry with him programmed to were he can press a button sort of like a cash register he will press a button it will be like ok Pretzel 2 dollars then he will put in an amount of how many soft pretzels he wants example 10 and it will come up to 20.00 then print out a receipt for the customer saying 10 soft pretzels salted total 20 dollars.

This part is not 100% needed but would be really preferred that all the receipts he makes could also be sent from the machine to a cloud or app we have on the work computer saving him time from typing all the receipts into the computer the next day.

Thank you for reading all this i hope it was clear if not please say where it was not and i will quickly clear up the confusion i can not seem to figure out what i need to accomplish this goal. Thank you in advance.What do I need exactly? Mobile Printer I am thinking."

Don't think about the complicated aspects of it. Pretend that the universe allows you to chuck everything in a cosmic blender and a smartphone just magically pops out.

1,"Hey folks.

Sorry if you've done this loads of times. I'm hoping to gather some information for local councils about drones and drone operators in the UK. The survey page says it, but I'll say it again here:

[This 30-second anonymous questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAbrrn1rO5KmjS_sVrFsi3-cF1R282JvJ3i7Rw2n4OG_44FQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) may help take data to local UK councils on the owning and usage of drones in the UK. The data will hopefully help shape council drone policies, and help change policies already in place which are excessive and unfair.

In the UK, the CAA and Government have identified areas, or Flight Restriction Zones (FRZ), over and around airports and runways in which flying drones is not allowed without proper permissions. These FRZ restrictions are fair and proportionate.

However, some local councils have published their own drone policies which form a ""blanket ban"" in parks and open spaces outside of designated Flight Restriction Zones, with some policies including on-the-spot fines and fixed penalty notices ranging from £100 to £1000.

Some councils also have costs attached to giving permission for commercial drone flights, with some costs ranging from £25 to £300 ""per take-off"". These costs are disproportionate from council to council, and unquantifiable in that the council fees requested are not justifiable on the grounds of what the drone operator is actually doing (ie, the size and duration of a battery, and therefore how many take-offs, should not dictate the overall cost to a local council).

Some of these local council policies are:

* disproportionate in comparison to Flight Restriction Zones already set
* excessive by being unnecessarily restrictive in spaces that are ""Drone Code"" safe
* causing licensed Drone Pilots to fly INSIDE FRZ's instead of outside
* increasing collision risk by decreasing separation distances from OUTSIDE to INSIDE FRZ
* unfair, by restricting licensed pilots from keeping required ""airmanship""
* inflating drone flight costs with unjustifiable council permission fees
* inflating costs by passing council permission fees to production companies

By answering the questions, data can be taken to local councils to show drone usage and measurable data in relation to the understanding of rules and regulations.

I'd be really grateful if UK drone owners/operators could [spend 30 seconds clicking a few multiple choice questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAbrrn1rO5KmjS_sVrFsi3-cF1R282JvJ3i7Rw2n4OG_44FQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

1,"Hey all,

From my observations it seems that our world exponentially grows toward digitization of many things; I wouldn't be surprised if technology related knowledge once not essential becomes a regular part of society, honestly. That's what got me thinking, as I'm sure that various skills would be awesome to know in the years coming out. What sort of knowledge would you think is necessary?

Off the top of my head, I've come up with a few things:

* General computer usage skills, what one would call ""tech-savviness,"" as in one must know how to operate computers in settings, and whatnot
* Scripting knowledge, not necessarily CS, but in this day and age, being able to whip something out in Python, on the command line/terminal would benefit all
* Security knowledge- if you follow the news, big breaches occur far more often than one would expect, at least for me. Again going back to savviness, I think it'd be awesome if most tried to put more security in effect with their passwords and such, whether it be password managers, etc.

Of course, I'm not particularly skillful in anything, so those are just my observations. I'm curious to see what your responses/thoughts are!

Cheers!Let's list some important things to know for the future!"

1,"So for a combined 1 year I had to deal with a one plus x which had been water damaged resulting in me being unable to see half the keyboard, the brightness levels at an unfathomable dullness which resulted in me having to cover the phone with my hand while I stood centimetres from the screen to read a simple text message, after I decided I couldn't bear to deal with that situation for any longer than the multiple months it had somehow dragged on for. I then picked up my friends old IPhone 5, now I saw this as nothing short of a huge upgrade considering my previous situation. Following about a month of use in which my main complaint was the 60 minute battery life of the phone... The home screen button died, so for the following couple of months I would restart my phone to log in and choose an app in which I wanted to use and then stick to it until I was finished with that because I would not be able to switch between apps during use. So unemployed apart from the income that I had supposedly made from my youtube channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH9vY\_kzBKhDDrpMavKxTIQ?view\_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH9vY_kzBKhDDrpMavKxTIQ?view_as=subscriber) (unashamed plug considering my current situation, subscribe, do all that good stuff if you wish or completely dismiss this, that's equally fine). So I then caved again and had to ask my parents to help me buy a new phone (Im still in school), with the hopes that I would reimburse them once i start making some $ on my youtube channel or just get accepted for any of the 6000 jobs Id applied for. So after finally getting a new phone and doing so in great style with an iPhone 8, I then proceeded to lose it as it slipped out of my shallow pockets on public transport... yeh didn't really feel the need to build up the situation of losing my phone because its too fresh and I did not want to recount it... But anyway that's my rather unintelligible story that is probably more funny if I was good at storytelling but yeh I'm fuming.Love to see it"

I've tried googling this, but the set of words I want to use throws up answers to a different problem, which would also use those words. Anyway. Maybe someone can help.

I've recently moved away from my family for work and what I'd like to do is log into netflix, for example, and me and my family back at home watch the same film at the same time, perfectly* synced.

This is relatively easy for a film, in fact. Although it can be annoying for the first five minutes trying to sync our viewing. Where I'd really appreciate it is watching a series with adverts together with my family. In these cases, even if we get synced, after the next advert break we are inevitably out of sync.

As you can see, my question is ""is there a piece of streaming tech that can watch the same content on two different streams, synced?""

1,"Report on the Peer Review of the Draft NTP Technical Reports on Radio Frequency Radiation 
Exposure to Rats (900 MHz) in TR-595 and Mice (1900 MHz) in TR-596
 Presenter: Dr. Chad Blystone, NIEHS/DNTP 
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) convened a Peer Review Panel on March 26-28, 2018 to 
for reviewing these two Draft NTP Technical Reports. These reports contained the NTP’s 
evaluation of the potential chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity from radio frequency radiation 
at two frequencies and modulations. The frequencies 900 MHz (rats) and 1900 MHz (mice) and 
modulations of GSM and CDMA were selected based on common usage in cell phone devices 
and modeled exposure tolerances. This research program was made up of a series of technical, 
logistical and toxicity evaluations starting with the development, construction, and validation of 
the exposure chambers, to initial pilot studies in animals, followed by 28-day toxicity studies, 
and ultimately the two-year study in both species. 
The review of the two technical reports began with an assessment of the exposure system. A 
Panel of experts in the area of radio frequency radiation reviewed the exposure system which 
was developed, constructed, and validated in conjunction with National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) and IT’IS Foundation. A second Panel made up of experts in toxicology, 
pathology, and statistics reviewed the toxicity studies (the 28-day toxicity studies and the two year studies) starting with the mouse report (TR-595), and then the rat report (TR-596). 
There was robust discussion by the Peer Review Panels on the exposure system and NTP’s draft 
scientific interpretations. The Panel recommended increasing the NTP’s level of evidence calls 
regarding the heart in male and female rats, adrenal gland in male rats (GSM only), and the 
brain (gliomas) in male rats of both modulations. 
The Panel’s comments on the draft interpretations will be captured in the peer review report, 
which will be posted with other meeting materials when completed. NTP will carefully consider 
the Panel’s recommendations when finalizing these technical reports, which will be published 
on the NTP website in fall 2018 (https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/36144)More data about RF exposure and cancer."

My phone is four years old and is in great shape physically. Unfortunately I cannot put anything on it; I was told by a Verizon employee that Apple sets their updates to take up more and more space with each update and you cannot do anything about it so you eventually just have to buy a new phone.

My old MacBook had issues and cost $800 to repair so I bought a new one recently. The battery is horrible! It's like a cheapo version of what I used to have. I've had non stop issues with my air pods shutting off while I'm on the phone with a call. I bought my fiance a series 4 Apple watch for Christmas and it's had glitching since the day it was opened.

All of this makes me never want to buy an Apple product again. The company used to make quality reliable products. Now everything just seems cheaply made and expensive. I feel like people are paying for the brand name only at this point.

This all being said I desperately need a new phone. Has anyone made the switch to non Apple with limited issues?? I heard crApple makes it super hard to switch. Any recommendations on a great phone alternative to the new iPhones?? I just want a quality reliable easy product. All phones are crazy expensive these days, is that so much to ask?crApple protest!"

My trusty old MBP (mid-2009) was sitting more or less unused the last 5 years or so; but I ended up performing all the obvious upgrades over the years, because why not. I was curious how much life I could get outta 'er, so: 8GB RAM; 256 GB SSD; new battery.

What's astonishing is, the more I use this computer just for novelty (and its amazing keyboard, as opposed to the garbage that is my 2017 MacBook butterfly mechanism), the more I arrive at the same conclusion: 

But for the fact that Apple limited this computer to macOS El Capitan (10.11.6), this computer is otherwise completely capable of being used as a daily machine, for any and all tasks I throw at it.

Sure, my shiny new iMac Retina 5K 27"" (early 2019) will blow its iMove export capabilities out of the water (I clocked it at between 4-5x faster; though I'm not even sure how impressive that is given the decade between the two), but besides that -- when thinking only about things like basic web browsing; Google Suite/Drive; iCloud web; Squarespace; etc -- apart from occasional latency and lag here and there when opening a bunch of tabs at the same time, say, my chunky, plucky little ""vintage"" MacBook Pro from 2009 isn't just able to do duty as a modern daily computer, it's legitimately more than capable.

This, to me, is truly astonishing, as a 10 year-old computer in the past, would NEVER be able to hold its own in the present era.

Color me completely, utterly mind blown. Bravo, Apple?

Thoughts, anybody?My 2009 MacBook Pro is 10 years old. 10 years was the difference between an IBM XT in 1985 &amp; Mac LC II in 1995 &amp; Dell Latitude in 2005, and the earlier computers would be unusable 10 years later. Meanwhile, my MBP (8GB RAM &amp; SSD) is still fine as a modern computer"

These choices lead Bluetooth speakers to became the major tech focus over docking stations, pushed portability forward and a few years on, wireless/BT growth has subsequently lead mobile developers to slowly do away with the headphone jack and port.

Hi requestbruh,

Penalty:

Given 1 points which will never expire.

Content moderated - Indefinitely

Restricted from posting - 3 months and 11 days

FUD spreading. If you had only given a look at the javascript you mention you would have avoided to spread nonsense.

javascript is required since 2011 in our web site and you wake up only now? :)

— AirVPN

\# ---------

my original post that your company edited and removed from a forum that has an section for inviting 'feedback' on your new site design was close to this:

'forcing javascript now? really? what's your email provider? what's your browser?'

\# ---------

first, my post is a critique, a 'feedback' post on your new site design, the 'gripe' is the simple fact your company is forcing customers and potential customers

to have javascript enabled in order for the site to even load, meaning nobody can review any content without first enabling javascript in their browser

as you stated the site has always required javascript but not to view the site itself, that's the complaint, the feedback, that's not FUD spreading sir/mam that's

what your site is doing, anyone can hit the internet archive and look at the previous versions of the site to verify my statement

javascript has been required since 2011 for certain sections of the site but not to simply view the site or the forum

feel free to close my account out at any time ya want, i'm not gonna give my hard earned money to a vpn provider that censors their own forum and forces javascript

you are not the only vpn provider around the internet and straight up, at this point, i in no way shape or form trust you or your company

sincerely, rod leathers 091919

\# ---------

tested this out on different airvpn servers and browsers same deal, forcing javascript on their customers you can not even look at their site now without enabling

javascript first, this is NOT 'air to beathe the internet' most of the internet doesn't force javascript like they are doing now so my suggestion is avoid them and

go with some other vpn provider

so not only are they forcing javascript upon their customers they heavily censor their forum, you can not even ask about the javascript or you get a warning email from

them as shown above, and when you say anything about it basically they treat you bad so not a company i suggest anyone can trust with their traffic imho

Market analysis is the predominant thing to do while thinking of your next product idea. Without knowledge of market situation companies may run into serious problems as their products fail to deliver educational value.

1,"In 2006 I went to a technical college with lightning fast internet and an internal on-campus P2P network which was even faster. That was when the problem started.

I downloaded anything I wanted, and the days of downloading on my parents home internet were over. I had convinced them to upgrade to one of the best packages just so I could download more stuff, but I had been downloading a movie in a matter of hours or at worst days, whereas I was now able to get a movie in a matter of seconds.

So... I began collecting.

I started with a 500GB drive and a 250GB drive coming into freshman year. They offered hard drives for sale at the campus store, and I always found a way to get more money to buy more. I was a complete asshole spoiled brat, to be honest. Most of it involved asking my parents for money for equipment for classes, when in reality - you know. I would spend it on upgrades I didn't really need. Thinking it would make me cool. I had a PC case from ibuypower or something. I was one of those types of kids in college.

At the end of college I had collected about 4TB worth of movies, tv shows, games, and probably a little x-rated stuff. Then I kept collecting through the years. I used to rip netflix movies and shows from screen capture and I would setup my computer to capture while I was asleep, and rip DVDs and Blu-Rays (those blu-ray rips alone are about 2TB now). I have been downloading from torrent ever since, and now in 2019 I am looking at my 16TB stripe drive here which I have finally organized out everything but movies and TV shows and downloads... It's all here and theres 900GB free.  If I wanted to archive it for backup purposes...

I tried cloud services. They all have limits. And it would cost a lot of money to store this all online. So offline storage is all Ive got. And I can't keep buying new hard drives every few years when I just realized something major -

&amp;#x200B;

I have been hoarding media. I haven't even watched this stuff in years. And I don't plan to. I was watching a show about hoarders, and this lady is up to her torso in filth, and she wont throw out even a scrap of newspaper with rat piss and shit all over it, because she says "" I haven't read that yet, what if there is something important written on it.""

&amp;#x200B;

And it dawned on me, I am a fucking hoarder of media. I have been up to my torso in shitty smelly old movies covered in rat piss and shit I'll never want to really watch again, like Borat.                            I love you Sacha😘. Or even ones that were good and deserve to be recognized as classics of some kind, like Pan's Labyrinth.  I've lived the magic of those movies and tv shows and they are over.  And If I haven't watched them by now, it's time to let go.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to just delete it all, and call it done. It's been over 13 years and over 16TB but it's all getting wiped today, every single file. I am doing a whole format and splitting the raid stripe and everything, and I'll just use the drives to backup important things from now on, like family photos, memories, work files, and that kind of stuff.Confessions of a media hoarder: I think it's time for me to let go"

Hi r/technology ! We are a team of students in general management in Switzerland and for the last year of our master we work in relationship with a center of microtechnics and electrotechnics that developed a technology and we must find applications for it.

We would be very happy if you could tell us your opinion on it but first here is the presentation of our device:

--------------

After deciding in which field we wanted to apply our technology we got a device that we called witness. It measures and monitors different factors such as air quality, temperature, humidity, light and it can also use a camera to take pictures. The device is plugged on a flexible photovoltaic cell (PV cell) that can also generate power in non-direct sunlight (inside a room, house…). The PV cell is built as a sticker so you can basically stick it wherever you want. The device works in ultra-low-power (ULP) and communicates the data through Bluetooth low energy (BLE). 

Photo of our sensor: https://i.imgur.com/93joHc8.png

We can integrate different captors (visual, sound, infra-red, chemical) it holds a battery, a memory chip and a small processor that can support an already trained IA or another basic program.

The consumer buys the number of “PV stickers and sensors” that they needs. They can use one by room to monitor their interior. Then the data can be sent (encrypted or not) to their phone / computer or monitoring device. Our goal there is to save energy and its costs by monitoring your interior simply and efficiently.

Since the device can support an already trained IA we wanted to make it open source so that any customer can create his own program and share it with the community. Which is where you might be interested to step in?

--------------------------------------

We're looking for opinions, inputs, etc on this tool, especially from people with programming background (but from everyone really).

What do you think about this technology? Would you have use for it? What would you make you want to use it? And how far would you go with this?Looking for applications to a Witness sensor, would love to hear your opinion and input on it"

According to [Amazon Workers are Listening to What You Tell Alexa](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/is-anyone-listening-to-you-on-alexa-a-global-team-reviews-audio), some sensitive information gets picked up, like bank account numbers and sometimes even sexual assault happenings. The title of the article implies it only happens when its in use, but why would they be picking stuff like that up if Alexa is supposed to not be recording when not activated? Or is it because it accidentally got activated because something the person said sounded like the wake word? 

The idea that Alexa can be recording your entire audio life is kind of creepy, but is it?Is Amazon Echo listening &amp; possibly recording when not activated with the wake word?"

And I thought that the data transfer protocol is always a compromise between range, speed and reliability. But what if all these characteristics fade into the background, and the decisive factor is the impression factor for the user? I decided to make a protocol in which note frequencies will be used for modulation.

I selected 16 frequencies for each hexadecimal character starting from C1. Using higher notes will make your ears less comfortable. And lower notes are worse transmitted due to the characteristics of the speakers and microphones. It turned out a kind of musical-frequency modulation.

You can listen to how any phrases sound in a [small online demo](https://octave.skrup.ru/?lang=en&amp;message=Reddit).

Of course, it’s fun to listen to random sounds based on text, but data transmission can only be called if the signal is received. I made a prototype receiver as a proof of concept. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4oj1lZcFw) of how it works.

All current developments are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/krupnikas/octave) \- you can try to develop the project yourself.

Where do you think you can apply such musical modulation technology?Data transmission at note frequencies"

Necessity is the mother of invention. The root of all the technology and its applications emerges from human needs. The same is with the ""PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor"", and PiXL Document Reader"". The idea of these two products arises from our financial sector client's needs. The 

# The story begins here...

We are in a time where the technologies enable machines to simulate and augment human intelligence. Banking sectors are also inside the circle of intelligence age or else within a short time we can see a drastic change in financial services especially in manual works. They are the world of computers and networks that store the world economy in databases. PixDynamics had a trusted relationship with a prominent bank where they find difficulties in KYC form extraction and classification. Banks are the place where they handle a bulk of paper documents. We have to submit our proofs say Adhar cards, voters ID or any other means of Id proofs. This had to be entered into the system by a bank employee. Imagine how difficult it is to do these works manually. This is a practice that had been followed for years. Even though we address banks are in the path of AI, a lot of manual works are still an ongoing process. This gives us the idea of ""PiXL KYC Classifier and Extractor"", and PiXL Document reader "". Our developing team developed the product under DL and ML proficiency. After implementing the product our client bank classify and extracts the documents with less time and thus gets the documents scanned with 99 percent accuracy. And now we had a trusted relationship with a couple of banks where they realize the product's efficiency and quality.

It was a hard work of one and a half years effect within the hands of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. The flow of the project was 

**Data collection -&gt; Train the system -&gt; Optimization**

The first real step to train our system is **gathering data**. This step is very important because the quality and quantity of data that you gather will directly determine how good your predictive model can be. A few hours of measurements later, we have gathered our training data. Now it’s time for the next step of machine learning: **Data preparation**, where we load our data into a suitable place and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. Now we move onto what is often considered the bulk of machine learning — the T**raining**. In this step, we will use our data to incrementally improve our model’s ability to predict whether a given drink is wine or beer. Once training is complete, it’s time to see if the model is any good, using **Evaluation**. This is where that dataset that we set aside earlier comes into play. Evaluation allows us to test our model against data that has never been used for training.

I never received any sort of education on what to watch out for on the Internet (never had sex ed either but thats another story / social problem where I'm from lol) - how to identify fake news, how to evaluate your source of information, what to do when you're approached by a stranger online (like social media requests from people you don't know, people on Omegle asking for your personal info), the risk of sharing stuff publicly that would possibly go viral / out of hand, what to do and whom to approach if content related to you is spread online without your explicit consent, etc,.

The European equivalent of fancy conferences like Google's I/O or Apple's WWDC don't get much exposure.

My question is: What are all the cool tech conferences I should look out for? I'm someone who LOVES tech. So it doesn't matter if it's a language or platform or gadget. Anything related to tech would be a great starting point.

Thanks.[Discussion] Technology conferences/expos in Europe in 2020?"
1," The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has [ordered Boeing 787 operators to switch their aircraft off and on every 51 days](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/) to prevent what it called ""several potentially catastrophic failure scenarios"" -- including the crashing of onboard network switches. The Register reports:*The* [*airworthiness directive*](https://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/US-2020-06-14)*, due to be enforced from later this month, orders airlines to power-cycle their B787s before the aircraft reaches the specified days of continuous power-on operation. The power cycling is needed to prevent stale data from populating the aircraft's systems, a problem that has occurred on different 787 systems in the past. According to the directive itself, if the aircraft is powered on for more than 51 days this can lead to ""display of misleading data"" to the pilots, with that data including airspeed, attitude, altitude and engine operating indications. On top of all that, the stall warning horn and overspeed horn also stop working.*  


*This alarming-sounding situation comes about because, for reasons the directive did not go into, the 787's common core system (CCS) -- a Wind River VxWorks realtime OS product, at heart -- stops filtering out stale data from key flight control displays. That stale data-monitoring function going down in turn ""could lead to undetected or unannunciated loss of common data network (CDN) message age validation, combined with a CDN switch failure."" Solving the problem is simple: power the aircraft down completely before reaching 51 days. It is usual for commercial airliners to spend weeks or more continuously powered on as crews change at airports, or ground power is plugged in overnight while cleaners and maintainers do their thing.*

1,"What I really want is a big serious discussion of ideas, thoughts, explanations of how or why it could or couldn't work, OR even just what would it take to replace your other devices.

&amp;#x200B;

Samsung DeX and Huawei EMUI, iPad OS (not the same but it could get there), Windows Continuum (dead), ARM on Windows (trying to be more mobile friendly with Smartphone tech).

They are all beating around the bush for what they could be. DeX and EMUI are the closest to REALLY appealing to me in terms of usability, but I wanted Windows and Apple to pull through because they are honestly the big influence... Love them or hate them, it's just how it is.

iPad OS was SO close to what I thought the iPad should do to begin with! Not dock on a literal MacBook but just become the MacBook [https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/01/28/apple-planning-iphones-and-ipads-that-can-dock-inside-macbooks](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/01/28/apple-planning-iphones-and-ipads-that-can-dock-inside-macbooks) 

If only iPad OS made use of the device to be able to take full advantage. *You can use a mouse (pointer) on the iPad*. **Poorly** but if people want it, they will catch on and make it better and more functional. The UI if used like a laptop is chunky, maybe they will listen and have an option to switch to a mode like that. I feel like Apple is so close too.

SO what is great? What is missing and what could they add eventually?...

**The Good:**

DeX and EMUI are great. Scaling apps, multitasking, some pretty impressive app capabilities. 

Windows was a false hope but started the dock your phone and work on the go. Dock the phone, add accessories. What they needed was something like Windows 10 on ARM to be the base and make the rest of the mobile aspect work on that.

iPad OS just needs to turn into the laptop... All the talk about PC performance on their chip yet they use it to run mobile software... I still have some hope for Apple though they just need a push from competition. Like always these days.

**What's missing?**

1. USB C all the things! Standard USB C ports need to just support everything on one port.
2. A setup.  (2a) Monitor + keyboard + trackpad + battery all in one -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNCuEYF5uKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNCuEYF5uKk) \-- It needs a better screen and a few other things, but it's easy to setup and if made right it could support more just like a real Laptop. --   (2b.) A dock -- A proper one that has multiple USB Cs, display outputs and all the standard ports, to be able to work for a Desktop set up.
3. Get the gamers involved in the market! -- Be able to connect external GPU with USB C -- NVIDIA has worked on ARM before, they could get on board with making it work. Steam would definitely hop on Linux again for Android and maybe use a x86 emulation (or better, the real deal) that Windows has already working better than it has before. -- this is a harder one that would take a while to get to work but the pieces are their I think.
4. (**HARD** stretch) Microsoft needs to get back in the mobile game. If they base a phone for using ARM on Windows 10 as their selling point, they could maybe make a realistic reason for people to buy their phones. Directly compatible, if not eventual just completely replace, standard Windows 10

Please discuss. I'm not looking for just complete counter points to my thoughts. What do YOU want if smartphones replaced PCs and how do you think they could do it? Thanks.Hear me out about the idea of phones ACTUALLY replacing computers."

1," 

I  have been a very satisfied Amazon Prime customer for 11 years now.  I  have spent thousands of dollars ordering products through them.  I also  started incorporating their automation eco system into my home since the  very first Amazon Echo was released, and I was on the preorder. (The  pringles can).  
Since that time, I have installed Amazon devices in  each room of my house, bedrooms, kitchen, dining room as well as both  bathrooms.  
I purchased the Fire TV recast, and installed Amazon Fire sticks on each of the 5 TV's in my home.  
Fast forward to today:  
My  Amazon Prime Credit Card was compromised, and 5 purchased for Amazon  gift cards that I did not authorize, were charged to my card.  I called  and reported the fraudulent charges.  They told me they would  investigate the charges, and happily return the money to my card.  
When  I got home from work, every device in my house had the amber ring going  around in a circle.  Any commands to the echo, were promptly replied  with “Please see the Alexa app to continue setup.  
I had never seen  this, and called Amazon support.  They informed me that my account was  placed on hold, until the charge backs were investigated.  Put on hold  would be one thing, but every device in my house was rest to factory  defaults.  Losing all alarms, device settings, reminders, shopping  lists, and all other settings.   She said it would take 3-4 days for the  investigation to complete, and my account would be reactivated at that  point.  2 Days later, I called again, and the rep said it never takes 3  to 4 days, and everything should be working within the next 24 hours.   Another 2 days, and I get the same run around that the account is on  hold.  
It has now been 3 more days, and I called Amazon once again,  and explained everything all over again.  They informed me that there  was nothing they could do, as the account was on hold!  After being on  the phone for more than an hour I got no where.  
During the course of  this fiasco, no one ever took a serious interest in resolving my  problem, showed any compassion in any way, nor apologized for the  inconvenience.  
I woke up to the realization that I had given Amazon  FAR too much control of my life.  I can not longer listen to prime music  (which I pay monthly for) on the Alexa auto in either of my vehicles.  I  can not control around 40% of the lights in my house, as they are on  Alexa controlled plug modules.  The rest are in wall controlled switches  that I can use normally.   I had to dig out an old alarm clock from the  closet to wake me up for work.   I can not watch anything live on the  Amazon Recast, or that has been recorded on the Amazon DVR.  I have no  access to watch TV in any way, except the living room TV that has  Netflix built in.  I can understand turning off prime video, but I can  not watch Netflix, Hulu or anything else on  the fire sticks,  that I  Purchased outright.  
I am unable to log into my account on Amazon,  neither to look at delivery times for some things that I had ordered,  and can not place any new orders with Prime that I have PAID the $110 in  advance for.  
Tonight I decided to say Bye Bye Amazon!   I went to  Target and purchased replacement Google Home devices, and I am slowly  converting everything over to their eco system.  Luckily my main  interface to the automated switches, lights and plugs is a Wink hub, and  it is compatible with Google.

So take this as a word of warning, and be very careful just how much you allow Amazon control of your life.  
I  have pulled out every piece of Amazon equipment from my home, and  everything is going on eBay this weekend.Be Very Wary of Amazon!"

A little bit of back-story: Xinjiang, China is an information vacuum. With reports of a million Uyghurs in detention, plus censorship, surveillance and a blackout on outside communication, it’s hard to know what’s happening. But [some TikTok users have started using the app to share visual clues about life under Xinjiang surveillance](https://codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/tiktok-uyghur-china/). That’s why international Uyghur activists are digging deep into TikTok &amp; similar apps. They’ve found videos that show China’s ongoing destruction of Uyghur and other Muslim architecture, checkpoints with long lines of Uyghurs waiting to go through, and videos of crying people in front of pictures of their relatives. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is behind China’s firewall. To gain entry, international Uyghur activists have to use Chinese phones. To find compromising content from Xinjiang TikTok, the Uyghur activists “game” the app’s algorithm, which serves them content according to how they respond to each video. Searching isn’t an option. Location-based TikTok search results are cleaned up by moderators. But still, videos make it through, and are downloaded by the activists and then reshared on other social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, so they don’t disappear. 

TikTok - obviously - wasn’t made to share human rights violations, but for some it has become the only tool to let the world know what’s happening.

1,"WASHINGTON—The Trump administration has bought access to a commercial database that maps the movements of millions of cellphones in America and is using it for immigration and border enforcement, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The location data is drawn from ordinary cellphone apps, including those for games, weather and e-commerce, for which the user has granted permission to log the phone’s location.

The Department of Homeland Security has used the information to detect undocumented immigrants and others who may be entering the U.S. unlawfully, according to these people and documents.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a division of DHS, has used the data to help identify immigrants who were later arrested, these people said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, another agency under DHS, uses the information to look for cellphone activity in unusual places, such as remote stretches of desert that straddle the Mexican border, the people said.

The federal government’s use of such data for law enforcement purposes hasn’t previously been reported.

A tunnel authorities say was used to smuggle drugs across the Mexican border terminated inside a closed fast-food restaurant in San Luis, Ariz. The tunnel was discovered by agents monitoring the movements of cellphone users.

Experts say the information amounts to one of the largest known troves of bulk data being deployed by law enforcement in the U.S.—and that the use appears to be on firm legal footing because the government buys access to it from a commercial vendor, just as a private company could, though its use hasn’t been tested in court.

“This is a classic situation where creeping commercial surveillance in the private sector is now bleeding directly over into government,” said Alan Butler, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a think tank that pushes for stronger privacy laws.

According to federal spending contracts, a division of DHS that creates experimental products began buying location data in 2017 from Venntel Inc. of Herndon, Va., a small company that shares several executives and patents with Gravy Analytics, a major player in the mobile-advertising world.

In 2018, ICE bought $190,000 worth of Venntel licenses. Last September, CBP bought $1.1 million in licenses for three kinds of software, including Venntel subscriptions for location data.

The Department of Homeland Security and its components acknowledged buying access to the data, but wouldn’t discuss details about how they are using it in law-enforcement operations. People familiar with some of the efforts say it is used to generate investigative leads about possible illegal border crossings and for detecting or tracking migrant groups.

CBP has said it has privacy protections and limits on how it uses the location information. The agency says that it accesses only a small amount of the location data and that the data it does use is anonymized to protect the privacy of Americans.

“While CBP is being provided access to location information, it is important to note that such information doesn’t include cellular phone tower data, is not ingested in bulk and doesn’t include the individual user’s identity,” said a CBP spokesman. Tower data from cellphone companies, which can locate a specific phone, has been singled out by the Supreme Court for extra protection.

ICE initially was given access to the data for use by its criminal investigators who track human- and drug-smuggling organizations, according to people familiar with the activity. Subsequently, the data was shared with ICE’s arm that carries out deportations, one of the people said.

“We do not discuss specific law-enforcement tactics or techniques, or discuss the existence or absence of specific law-enforcement-sensitive capabilities,” said ICE spokesman Bryan Cox. Mr. Cox said the agency “generally” doesn’t use location data for routine deportation operations.

The data was used to detect cellphones moving through what was later discovered to be a tunnel created by drug smugglers between the U.S. and Mexico that terminated in a closed Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet on the U.S. side near San Luis, Ariz., said people with knowledge of the operation.

The data tracking contributed to the 2018 arrest of the defunct restaurant’s owner, Ivan Lopez, on conspiracy charges related to the construction of the tunnel, the people said. But police records of the incident make no mention of the use of data showing cellphones crossing the border in an unusual location, attributing the case instead to a routine traffic stop.

Contracting records show the federal government is buying the location data from Venntel. Venntel, in turn, purchased the information from private marketing companies that sell the location data of millions of cellphones to advertisers, people familiar with the matter say.

Venntel’s president, Chris Gildea, said, “We are not able to comment on behalf of our customers, and any inquiries on this contract should be directed to DHS.”

The company’s website says that it “supports our national interests through technological innovation, data reliability and proven results.” It says it offers defense-intelligence and national-security services.

Digital marketing, a multibillion-dollar industry, uses such data to deliver, for example, an ad for a restaurant or store to a nearby consumer who is scrolling through Facebook on a phone.

Divisions of DHS, ICE and CBP have purchased licenses to use Venntel’s software as part of analytical programs for border security and other law-enforcement efforts, federal records show. Separate government documents make oblique references to such data being used to track, among other things, tunnels along the border.

The data is pseudonymised—meaning that each cellphone is represented by an alphanumeric advertising identifier that isn’t linked to the name of the cellphone’s owner. Cellphone users can change their identifier in their phone’s settings menu or limit the apps that have access to their location.

Though anonymized, such mobile location data can be used to identify and track individuals based on their real-world behavior, the New York Times reported in December.

Marketing data is widely used by the government to gather intelligence abroad, say people familiar with the matter. But those contracts are frequently classified, so the extent to which intelligence agencies are buying such data cannot be determined.

In 2018, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in the case Carpenter v. United States saying that geographic location data drawn from cellphones in the U.S. is a specially protected class of information because it reveals so much about Americans. The court put limits on law enforcement’s ability to obtain such data directly from cellphone companies without court supervision.

But the federal government has essentially found a workaround by purchasing location data used by marketing firms rather than going to court on a case-by-case basis. Because location data is available through numerous commercial ad exchanges, government lawyers have approved the programs and concluded that the Carpenter ruling doesn’t apply.

“In this case, the government is a commercial purchaser like anybody else. Carpenter is not relevant,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former DHS official who is a resident senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank that promotes free markets. “The government is just buying a widget.”

Honestly this shocked me; I haven't had this problem before (getting ads delivered via SMS I mean). And I also wonder why, exactly, the SMS service wasn't abused years ago to flood people with spam, seeing as how in this capitalist shithole in which we live, literally everything else is! Email, telemarketing/robocalls, fliers on your car, you name it. Why is SMS mostly impervious to abuse by advertisers and spammers? And is there anything else I should do besides blocking the number?

In true Android fascion, I am on an older OS version that hasn't seen an update in years and never will again, so some random asshole pushing unknown content to my device (especially with photos) makes me a bit nervous, because things like buffer overflow exploits are a thing, and the only people with less ethics than folks that work in the advertising industry are the overseas scammers whose day job it is to literally exploit grandmas.

That’s all I can say. I am now almost 40 and I feel like I am lost in the world as abuse has been front and center in my life, distracting me.

As such, I now find myself completely overwhelmed by technology and where to begin learning. I really need guidance.

I’ve always had an interest in tech. I’ve always had a desire to help myself and others in a significant way.

I believe bad things happen and they define you, good or bad: ultimately the choice is up to the individual.

I want to make sure that I rise up and fight for myself and for other victims. I need to learn about internet/phone etc. (sorry i don’t even know how to word it) security. Abusers are cunning and they are smarter than they lead one to believe. I have had my phone hacked I have been tracked etc. by abusers. People say this is impossible can’t be done. Internet searches don’t provide much info.

How can a novice like myself learn and eventually attempt to create solutions to protect themselves and others? Maybe something already exists. But I want to learn and understand. I don’t have much money and can not afford the cost of living let alone cost of education.

Can anyone point me in a direction, starting point etc.? Please. Thank you for your time.I need guidance on where to start learning tech independently so I can protect myself and others. Advice appreciated."

1,"Redwood City, Calif. and London -- Dec. 3, 2019 -- Hyperion X, created in 2019 as the data and technology division of Hyperion Insurance Group, a leading insurance group with employee ownership at its heart, has selected Reltio Cloud as the core client data platform to power its data and analytics capabilities and strengthen its competitive position in the insurance sector.

“We recognise that the combination of data and technology are now differentiating competitive advantages in our industry,” said Miguel Baptista, Chief Data Officer, Hyperion X. “Reltio Cloud gives us capabilities to fuel the experiences of the future at Hyperion X with the data that matters most to our business. It gives us the business agility, enterprise scale, and the insight-ready data we need for big ideas so we can compete effectively.”

Baptista joined Hyperion X from Merck Pharmaceuticals following more than 20 years in information management, customer insights and analytics strategy. He is responsible for leading Hyperion X’s data collection, use and analysis to develop a pipeline of digital products for clients and business partners whilst optimising delivery costs. This is a significant challenge in the insurance sector. To do this, Baptista needed to look beyond legacy customer data management solutions. He chose a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that aligned with Hyperion X’s cloud-first policy and focus on customer centricity. 

Baptista continued: “Hyperion X wanted to partner with a company that shares our goal of harnessing data to drive change and innovation within the insurance industry. In Reltio, we’ve found a great match; their approach to master data systems is both bold and unique; rather than modifying existing technology, Reltio chose to build from the ground up, creating a flexible platform that avoids the common constraints found in traditional MDM platforms. I am looking forward to incorporating Reltio into Hyperion X and working together to get the best out of our data.”

“We’re excited to work with visionary Chief Data Officers like Miguel who are accelerating innovation and growth with the strategic use of data,” said Manish Sood, CEO of Reltio. “Hyperion X is a great example of a company that is building a data-driven culture so they can reimagine what’s possible in their market. Miguel is leading a trend we’re seeing from forward-thinking CDOs who are working for companies that need to compete effectively in the experience economy but are held back by their legacy environment. To drive business agility, operate at enterprise scale in real-time, and generate big ideas, these CDOs are eliminating customer data silos and breaking free from legacy customer data management technology, innovating faster and responding to client needs quickly.”

For the third year in a row Reltio ranked on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies. The SaaS company, which is recognized for product functionality and performance, roadmap and vision, and a strong customer focus, has a European team, based in central London which is working closely with Baptista and his team to ensure they successfully support Hyperion X’s immediate and future needs as the company grows

The electronic signature should be based on the account the user is logged in to because our company has company wide accounts we use.

Anyone have any suggestions? Thank you!Automatic Document Control based on login?"

1,"Using SMS as a 2FA( Two factor authentication ) for Facebook is a TRAP, dont use it if you dont want to loose your account.

2FA is indeed necessary, but SMS 2FA??? Thats a trap. Its a problem because their server gets overloaded( which is very frequently the case ) and SMS will be delayed for more than a day. Ofcourse for that long, you are locked out of you account and have no idea whats going on. Its a good excuse for them to not allow you to use your account if you were behaving different than they expected you to.

There are many authentication apps available for Android, ios, or Symbian phones(Those old Nokia phones) if you just search the word ""Authenticator"" on the app store. Some apps from the top of my head are,

Authy
Google Authenticator
Aegis

They will work fine, if not better. In case of Aegis, the one I use, it exports a .json file(encrypted of course) that can be backed up and imported on other apps.

Just make sure your phone clock is correct. Usually clock skew of at minimum 30 seconds upto 1 minute is fine for Facebook.Using SMS 2FA on any website is a Trap, dont do it, use Authenticator apps instead"

در این روزها که سرمان به مشکلات ریز و درشت زندگی گرم است، چه بهانه ای بهتر از «شب یلدا» برای شاد بودن، برای فراموشی غمی که بر دلهایمان نشسته، برای حس دوباره «زندگی»... و چه زیباست که این شادی را در کنار دوستانمان جشن بگیریم و با هم خاطره سازی کنیم.

امسال نیز همچون سال های گذشته، مدیریت شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان شرایطی را ایجاد کردند که کارمندان و مدیران، مانند دوستانی دیرپا و قدیمی، در کنار یکدیگر جمع شده و لحظاتی شاد و به یاد ماندنی را تجربه کنند. نکته ای که بیش از همه برای مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر جای افتخار دارد، افزایش تعداد کارمندان و دوستان جدیدمان نسبت به سال گذشته است. به طوری که می توان گفت که جمعیت شرکت ایده برتر نسبت به همین مقطع در سال گذشته، دو برابر شده و با قدرت بیشتری به سمت موفقیت و آینده ای درخشان در حال حرکت است. از حضور تک تک دوستان در جمع مان خوشحالیم و به خود می بالیم که توانستیم لحظاتی هر چند کوتاه، شادی را به دل هایشان بیاوریم.

در کنار جشن یلدای 98، مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان از لوگوی جدید خود نیز رونمایی کرد. امیدواریم با استواری در مسیری که آغاز کرده ایم، روز به روز به پیشرفتمان ادامه داده و بتوانیم رضایت شما را بیش از پیش جلب نماییم.

1,"I am starting a new lab this fall at Florida International University (FIU). Our lab will focus on **understanding the neurocognitive processes that allow for the emergence of cognitive control** (how the human brain/mind monitors and adapts itself overtime to achieve task goals). Moreover, we will seek to understand how this system develops across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. Towards this end, methods that I currently employ, include: (single-trial) ERP analyses, time-frequency analyses of EEG (power and phase relations), source-localization of EEG, traditional fMRI approaches (GLM-based), and basic computational modeling (drift-diffusion models). Our lab is currently purchasing a high-density EEG system and FIU houses an fMRI scanner.

I am **seeking collaborators** that may or may not currently work in the fields of psychology or neuroscience, but that have at least some **expertise in one or more of the following domains: data science, advanced signal processing, machine learning, computational modeling, graph-theoretic/network analysis.** *I am most interested in finding collaborators that can help generate the best science; location, status, affiliation, or degrees earned are not important.* I also intend to take on at least one PhD student this fall and welcome responses from prospective students.

The scientific goal of this collaboration will be to combine skillsets in order to test novel hypotheses regarding the human cognitive control system, its developmental trajectory across adolescence, and relations to social behavior and social anxiety. At a practical level, we would seek to produce high-impact publications and to generate pilot data for pursuing collaborative grant proposals. **Depending on the situation, initial funding may be available for potential collaborators, consultants, or contractors.**

For examples of recent studies that will inform the work in our lab, please refer to the following publications:

The US had Huawei build backdoors into its hardware. However, under law, the manufacturer has to remove their ability to access these backdoors without network operator consent (although I question how feasible this is, as the manufacturers would have for more capabilities than law enforcement or intelligence).

From WSJ:

&gt;US officials say Huawei has built equipment that secretly preserves the manufacturer's ability to access networks through these interfaces without the carriers' knowledge. The officials didn't provide details of where they believe Huawei is able \[to\] access networks. Other manufacturers don't have the same ability, they said.

So these were not unknown backdoors. They claim they have proof that they could still use them, though they say nothing about evidence that they actually have. 

Outside the US I am not sure what the law says about hardware.

[Here is the arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/02/us-gave-allies-evidence-that-huawei-can-snoop-on-phone-networks-wsj-says/) article, as the WSJ is behind a paywall.US is claiming Huawei can still access backdoors they had them put in."

&gt;[...]the source code has multiple databases the addresses were hardcoded into. This is significant because these servers were left open on the public internet (no firewall that restricts say access to just a few IP addresses that passwords were allowed to come from). So the address was all you needed to get started bruteforcing a correct password combination into the database. This was neither needed or done because the credentials for accessing these databases were hardcoded AS WELL into the source code. Yet even this was unnecessary to access the database because if one simply logged in without any password...the database immediately granted access.

-

&gt; I will stop at this point to note that only the databases hosted in mainland China did appear to have protection, and the US databases did not appear to have passwords (although they might very well have on other interfaces we did not see). It’s strange that they seem to be protecting data in China more than data in the United States and this should be noted.

-

&gt; Also, it is interesting where the second Git server was hosted (https://git.wyzecam.com). Not only was it in mainland China, but in an IP space that is usually not seen for hosting “civilian” applications. It was out of Shanghai, where the most notorious of the Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat groups operate. Shanghai is a large city, but what matters more is that the telecom hosting the service indicates a location of Shanghai rather than the actual coordinates. As you can observe from the screenshot above, the server resides in an IP space owned by Beijing Kingsoft Cloud Internet Technology, or Kingsoft in ASN 59019.Smart Device Maker Wyze has a data breach of 2.4 million users info."

He sees a meme, and just believes it without doing any research behind it. As for 5g, I feel as though if somebody could actually PROVE how harmful it is, there'd be a class action lawsuit filed and they could be making a shit tonne of money from it. I will paste the post below - but can somebody please let me know if any of this is even true??

THE WIFI KILLSHOT by J.E. Ante
5G at 60Ghz resonates with the oxygen molecule and gives oxygen a reverse polarity that makes it much less usable to the human body. At high concentrations of 5G usage you get suffocation of humans at street level. And at lower doses you get flu like symptoms which are the exact same symptoms as the flu with this lowered oxygen uptake by the body. But the way 5G kills is much more interesting.

Our bodies have trillions of parasitic organisms inside which feed on us and some say help us live by doing many useful functions. But when these bacteria, fungi, and parasites are subjected to any WIFI microwave radiations they are harmed and begin reproducing toxins in self defense. These organisms begin reproducing rapidly to ensure their survival. And so we get flu like symptoms from these internal parasite organisms under attack from WIFI microwave radiations reproducing rapidly and excreting toxins. This is the real illness people are getting not a bio-weapon coronavirus.

2G has ten microwave frequencies assigned to it, 3G has ten also, 4G has five frequencies with some overlaps, but 5G has 3000 microwave frequencies assigned to it by the FCC. Why so many? So 5G should really be called 297G not 5G. So with this 5G rollout in China, Korea, Italy, Iran, and cruise ships we have the greatest concentrations of 5G usage and the greatest concentrations of illness and death in the world. Our internal parasites are like canaries in a mine and are being killed off rapidly from this 5G usage. When this happens too quickly the body can not get rid of the increased toxins and the host (you) die from toxemia. Our human cells are all tied together and form a much stronger union but our many parasitic hosts inside us are much more isolated within us and much more vulnerable to this WIFI microwave radiations. They try to survive by multiplying rapidly and making toxins to protect them from harm but it is no use and they die with 5G. And with their rapid death our bodies (at least of older and less healthy human) are overwhelmed by toxins very quickly and die from the combined effects of lowered oxygen uptake from 5G, and also from the massive overpopulation, and then die off of our internal biomass of germs and parasites, which creates overwhelming toxemia.

When the Chinese locked down the people in Wuhan they turned to their new 5G phones and internet connections and so the city was flooded with much more 5G WIFI radiations and made many more people fall sick and die. Many people even fell sick instantly at street level from oxygen deficiency which previously had no sickness. A massive cloud of 5G 60Ghz microwave radiations caused oxygen in the air to fall below critical levels for survival. 

Yesterday all of Asia turned off their 5G and left on only their 3G and 4G systems to communicate so they know 5G is the real cause of the illnesses.

So turn off your smartphones or put them in an aluminum pouch until you need to use them to lessen radiation exposure to yourself and everyone else. 

That is the real thing you must do instead of washing your hands to protect others. 

And if you would heal your elderly and grand parents put them in a Faraday cage where they will not be irradiated constantly by WIFI signals that are all around us especially in hospitals. Then their sick bodies may heal themselves in time as the toxemia clears from their bodies.

I’m talking if it’s paused for more than say 30 seconds, the game seems fine but the inputs don’t work. I have to reset. Other than that and the faulty battery the game seems to work fine. Does anybody know if this is related to the save battery or is the cartridge just a dud?Vintage Tech question regarding Nintendo game"

1,"Hi guys,


So I recently bought a smart tv.

 I heard that it is not possible to get a virus on your tv using a hdmi cable connected to a phone or laptop(that has a virus, or while your connected u go on a virus filled website to watch something) to your tv. Is this true. Also if there is a small chance of getting ur tv infected if there was a hyper virus, is there a higher chance of a virus appearing from the laptop or phone(both have viruses) connected to a tv. 

 One more thing, when you factory reset a laptop, will it remove all the viruses on it, if not, is there anyway to remove all viruses. And as we know, hdmi's for the most part dont give viruses, what about a micro usb to hdmi cable, or micro usb to hdmi adapter to hdmi cable(since phone has only a micro usb port) does this have the same chances of bringing a virus as a regular hdmi, or is it less safe


Many thanksSmart tv malware help"

I'm going to be starting my first semester of college in the fall and I don't think I'm going to be taking my desktop PC with me for distraction reasons. I want to get an e-notetaker and a laptop. I am torn between going with the paired Apple devices or with the remarkable 2 and a windows laptop. I know the advantages of having Apple would be the compatibility between the two devices and especially with my iPhone 11 (Airdrop of course and I think there's this new cool extra screen feature you can do with the IPad and a MacBook?). I don't think I will like taking notes on the IPad Pro because of the screen type and I wish I could feel what it's like writing on a Remarkable 2. I like the remarkable because it's so pencil-paper-like and I won't get distracted while using it. Can someone please help me decide???New Macbook Air + New IPad Pro OR New Remarkable 2 + New Dell XPS 13 ????"

I am debating between a Dell Precision m6600/6700 that is running an I7 processor, 32gb ram, 500gb SS, Nividia Graphics Card. OR an older MacBook Pro (2012), also running i7, 16gb ram, 256gb SSD. Both are running around $400-$500.

I will be mainly using it for projects and will be multitasking a lot. I will have around 30 or so tabs open on google chrome, word, excel, adobe, powerpoint running as well. It would also be used for occasional gaming like GTA V or Modern Warefare. My current laptop can not keep up with this demand and constantly freezes and overheats.

1," Before I start this debate, I want to make it clear to what I am referring to here, it is not the largest software and technology companies in the world today, but midsize, or even large companies that have no final purpose in software. 

 It's not a very long debate, and the answer to that may be pretty obvious, but I wonder what kind of blindness some entrepreneurs face today. For example, I've seen many cases of a company using open source technologies and to gain advantage over competition, develop things like extra functionality in the technology they use, attach all their systems to such functionality, it doesn't take long and the community is already far ahead of what they have developed, which makes the migration process much more difficult, while any other company that can adapt their systems to the new features developed by the community will be far ahead, which blinds them to the point of Instead of producing proprietary software that will soon be legacy, do not collaborate with open projects directly, so move forward so that they can adapt their implementations to it?Why do companies insist on making the same mistakes in IT?"

Companies are now working from home, schools are shut, supply chains have been disrupted, etc. Companies may come bruised out of this (corporate earnings get hurt, forced lay-offs, defaults, etc) but new cost &amp; operational efficiencies will come to light, i.e. actually it’s not so bad to conduct meetings over Zoom video call so let’s reduce the amount of international travel because it’ll help our bottom line. 

Schools closing down will accelerate the speed at which we start adopting MOOCs / virtual learning. Latter has been on a steep adoption curve but wonder whether this will finally render on-campus education obsolete.

\- Programming

\- Electrical engineering (e.g.  protoeus, eagle , matlab , etc)

\- some gaming, (e.g. lol )

so I decided to get a high refresh rate laptop, but I found it quite expensive, and I will get some specs that I really don't need!  
then , the idea of getting an external screen with the high refresh rate I want, and laptop has just the right amount of specs.  
but someone advised me to keep my old laptop for going out, and get a PC that I can customise the specs and everything!

1," ***Let\`s explore together how downtime and slow page load time burns a hole in your pocket and how you can ensure your site is speedy.*** 

It’s no longer a secret that a slower website is detrimental for your website. If your website doesn’t load fast enough, you end up losing customers, and possibly quite a bit of revenue. 

**The Real Question Is, What Is a Good Load Time?**

Well, you can get an idea of that by knowing that 53% of mobile users leave a website if it takes more than three seconds for loading. So, a website taking more than 4 seconds to load is considered to be the slowest while the average acceptable time for loading is two to three seconds.

**What Website Downtime Could Cost You**

Before looking into the consequences of downtime, let’s first see what downtime really is. It is when a website isn’t online or when it doesn’t allow users to do what they came to do in the first place.

Downtime easily causes businesses to lose an average of $7,900 for each minute that the website is down. Over the course of one year, for small and medium-sized businesses, this could total up to $1,000,000. In other words, for each minute the website down, a business would lose $66.240.

1,"Everybody is talking about chatbots. They have become that cool new toy on the market that companies put high on their wishlist. Chatbots promises to be faster, better, and cheaper than their human alternative. An interesting take on what started the hype and what the future looks like. [I recommend giving it a read here](https://www.botxo.co/blog/chatbots-after-the-hype/)

Snippet:

&gt;The first proof of superficial contact between man and machine took place in 1966 as the chatbot [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) was created. Fast forward to [MSN](https://www.msn.com/g00/da-dk/?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.encReferrer=&amp;i10c.dv=17), which is a web portal developed by Microsoft and launched in 1995. Here, we also encountered a chatbot that would enter conversations with its users and ask about simply anything. People were ecstatic. It was the start of the technological breakthrough that people had been waiting for. The bot would give standard answers to messages that were recognised by non-complex sentences or even just keywords. For a long time, chatbots’ purpose was to do just that – and even though these features and applications on platforms boosted the chatbots’ reputation wildly, these bots were not smart.

What the future will bring, is yet to see. What is your opinion on chatbots? Do they belong in customer service?Chatbots after the hype"

What was interesting about these was that they supported several different voltages and wattage amounts used by various Fast Charging methods - so with that in mind, the thought came to me - what are the prospects of appliances and other devices coming out in the future, with the option to use a Type C port, for power, instead of a traditional plug-in? 

While this may not be an option for say, an oven or a microwave, I could see it for things like TVs, and kitchen mixers of various kinds - maybe even a blender. Could USB C ultimately become a universal power standard and could we see additions made to the standard allowing for appliances, like hot water pots and microwaves to function - and if so, could the prospects of Ethernet over Power Line and even Internet over Power Line be re-explored for those instances where a smart TV or a laptop is plugged into a wall charger?The Potential of USB Type C and Future Specifications"

This is because people generally rely on the internet to discover new products and services.

With this shift from brick and mortar retail outlets to online e-commerce platforms, people find out about new brands through online reviews rather than word of mouth.

In this digital world, one of the major mediums through which businesses have been able to attract high online traffic to their e-stores is through search engine optimization, also known as SEO.

Through this process, businesses increase the rank of their web pages so that they are [visible on the first page](https://www.raletta.in/internship-in-indore/) when people search for the relevant keywords.

If the rank is high the business can expect to receive a major chunk of the traffic from users redirected from the search engines.

I am thinking of some curved wrap around oled display that wraps around a ring, the display essentially replicates the visuals of the surface of the one ring, and upon speaking the words, the inscription lights up.

How feasible is this to create now, and if not now, what do we need to make it so?Is there a way to create the one ring with glowing lettering?"

A large number of the Pixel 4 leaks have been related to its software, thanks to the numerous leakers who shared the new apps online. The new Pixel 4 live wallpapers, Pixel Launcher, Google Recorder app, and Google Camera app have been made publicly available, but other APKs from the new Pixels have also leaked. Thanks to Nextrift, we got our hands on a pre-release APK for Motion Sense, Google’s name for the Soli radar gestures, and it reveals which countries and media apps are supported.Google Pixel 4’s Motion Sense gestures should actually work in 53 regions and with 23 media apps"

1,"Hey All,

I thought this was relevant especially since most of you are some what idealistic and entrepreneurial. If you have a project (business/organization/company) that you always wanted to create, but you are not sure where to start this may be worth checking out.

This new organization I've been following ""Crowdspark"" started as a sub, but then expanded into an actual project with the goal of creating a social media platform for connecting entrepreneurs with great ideas with experienced professionals across all disciplines (i.e. business, law, HR, finance , engineers, programmers etc.) in order to form permanent teams to actualize the idea.

Basically it is a way that you can expand your entrepreneurial network to find the people you need. It is not a freelancing forum or place for consultants, but a place that you can go to find people who actually care about what you are trying to do and are in it for the long haul.

Eventually they also want to turn it into a full-fledged crowdsourced VC fund/incubator. They now have a dedicated development team that meets regurally. The just released a draft of their pitch deck that you can read at the link below of their sub r/crowdspark.

1,"Alright, I have a pretty straightforward question that I'm hoping one of you can answer.

Although my ISP uses dynamic IP Addresses, the lease renews before it ever expires, which means my IP address never actually changes.

I want a new IP address.

From my understanding, I can change my MAC address so it looks like a new piece of hardware, and I'll be given a new IP address. This being said, I went in and spoofed my MAC address in my modem/router settings to see if it would work. I quickly realized it wouldn't because my ISP must associate that new MAC address with my account for the services to work.

My question is: can I call my ISP and tell them I got a new modem/router (even though I didn't) and give them my spoofed MAC address I made, and this work like I expect it to?

1,"When people conventionally think of net neutrality, they think of the ISP that they are currently using throttling, extorting, or otherwise hampering usage of competing online television services.

But what is stopping net neutrality from being wielded the other way; (by the television streaming service) to harm a small ISP? It goes like this. You subscribe to a big company's TV streaming service. This company also runs a (big) ISP. But you are NOT using their ISP, you are instead using a small competitor to get your Internet connection. So, the big company providing you the online TV service sees this and fucks your connection to their Internet TV service unless the small ISP that you are currently using pays them a protection racket or you also switch to the big company as an ISP.

Now that the big ISPs are getting into the online television delivery game, do not think that they would not do the above, and that our current FCC would not let them.

Thoughts?Net Neutrality as a double-ended sword."

1,"I’m not sure where else to post this, so I hope someone here can help. 

To start things off, I got an Orbi router with 2 satellites, it’s working fine. I got the app on my phone and I can run speed tests that will tell me the exact speed the router is getting. 

So I then got a new ISP called “TDS” and we got the 300Mbps Down and Up package. I tested the speeds on my Orbi app to see the speeds after my new ISP did their installation. And I was getting around 290-295Mbps for download and upload. It looked good, and I was happy.

Then, about a few days ago, I tested my speeds again on my app, and the upload speed hasn’t changed, but my download went from 290-295 speeds, down to just 200. After I noticed this, I contacted TDS support, and they said they would send a technician out tomorrow. 

He came, and ran a speed test by directly plugging an Ethernet cable into the wall that ran to the modem. He was getting 290-300 for both download and upload. I even showed the technician my app, and how my download speeds were not matching up with my upload speeds. 

But he then says “On my laptop I’m getting up to 300 for both, so you’re getting what you’re paying for.” But why is my app not reflecting that like when they first installed my internet? Are they throttling me? Or is my router the issue? 

If anyone can give me some kind of insight, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.Is my ISP Throttling my Internet?"

However, I don't want to it record to a memory card, where it could later be lost, but instead upload itself straight to the cloud or maybe facebook, or some other place online.

1,"Hey everyone, I'm currently looking for a laptop that can last me through college. My budget is around $1.5K. I'm willing to dance around that price a little but nothing too expensive. I'm using it the most for work and educational purposes, but I would like the laptop to be able to run games decently, nothing too fancy. I don't necessarily need the processing to be insane, but it would be best if it could handle some stress. The most important fact is that I would like a laptop that is reputed for its durability and is also adequately well-rounded in its other aspects.

I heard gaming laptops can have high quality and processing powers, and I'm fine with buying one as long as it can last me through college. I also heard that Macs are pretty useful for long term use. But I'm not really a tech fanatic and the laptop market is huge. I've tried to do my research but every site tells me something different or isn't what I'm looking for.

1,"Hi! I recently bought a Gigabyte GT 710 2GB at my Computer Shop. They installed it, and its the drivers, and said I was ready to go. I know a GT 710 isn't a good graphics card, but it's better than the one I had. As soon as 'n came home and Started up the PC, I tried to play games (like Minecraft, Parkitect and Prison Architect). Some games there wasn't a problem. They had better frames at better settings. Other in the other hand, didn't work that well. The screen would just randomly go off. Not the monitor. It would just go black. Now I took the PC back to the shop, telling them the problem. They said they would do testing. A day later I have gone to fetch the PC. The shop said that they reinstalled the drivers and that everything work as it should. I was disappointed that as soon as I got home and started using the PC, the same happened again. I contacted them and they said I would maybe need to replace the PC cable. The cable that powers the PC. I don't see how that could make the card work. These problems started since I got the Graphics card. I don't know how to fix it. What should I do?
Thanks for the helpGraphics card not working"

I play videogames a lot, but I also listen to music or watch shows on Netflix, and my current headphones are broken so I decided to upgrade to noise-canceling headphones but  I don't know which ones to get that are affordable for my budget.I don't know if this is the correct sub, but I need help."

However, very often some live channels are running with pixels.  I never experience this with video services like Netflix.  So I dont think its my internet connection.

Is it worth upgrading to a streaming device like Apple TV or Roku for things like live TV?  Is the reason for the poor live tv performance due to me running an app that is built into the tv?  I dont want to sped $200 on a device and to find out there is no difference between the tv and the device.  And the poor performance is tied to something else.Optimum device for streaming live TV"

There are a couple of audio streams that I like to listen to, but couldn't due to my schedule.  Can anyone recommend a good cloud based audio streaming site?  Ideally, it should:

2 - Save the stream somewhere, either Dropbox or Google Drive, or allow me to download later.

3 - Extra bonus if the recording could be scheduled.

1,"The days of parents holding the hands of their children while they go shopping in crowded places or busy streets has ended for a while now. In the past decades, we see both parents and children holding mobile in their hands, which is similar to interlocking hands with brands like Apple, Samsung other devices to ensure that they are safe.  
No doubt that the Google MAPS and location sharing options are the new virtual handshakes that make two parties meet and also ensure the other party that, they are safe. We do this with a lot of people to ensure that our rides arrive on time where we are supposed to be picked up from, allowing sales reps to be on time to the client's offices also including the starstruck lovers to be aware of where their soulmate is heading to.  
Why not capitalize on this relationship between people and mobile by acting as the beacon lights guiding people to the right store by making use of the notification services and sending offer messages to eyes glued to the phones traveling through the alley of stores? This is what is the thought of most of the shopping malls or store owners, who can afford to buy beacon devices to send out notifications.

These offer notifications are acting as beautiful treats to the eyes of the customer and are turning the subconscious ""Wants"" to ""Needs"" most of the time, and are leading to purchases for many users. There are many shopping malls nowadays who are taking advantage of the beacon devices to not only guide people but also to ensure that stores enlist their offers and share the same with the users of the app.

It is cool, cause it is similar to the doors to the wonderland which entertains you and keeps you occupied even when you are out there in those malls just to kill your time or boredom. Trust me, it all starts when you download the app when you enter the mall to guide yourself through it and the rest (notifications) are just the candy rain (offers) in which you are going to be drenched.

If you have a smartphone device with an active internet connection you would be thrilled by the journey this would give you.

According to a new research published by Polaris Market Research the [**Air Compressor Market**](https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/air-compressor-market) is anticipated to reach over **USD 45.6 billion by 2026**. In 2017, the stationary air compressor segment dominated the global market, in terms of revenue. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the leading contributor to the global market revenue during the forecast period.

The increasing applications of air compressors in industries such as healthcare, construction, mining, automotive, and oil &amp; gas among others are expected to support the growth of this market. **Other driving factors include high energy efficiency, low maintenance cost, environmentally friendliness, portability, ability to deliver variation in supplied pressure. The increasing awareness regarding use of energy efficient compressors would boost the market growth during the forecast period.** However, rising cost of raw material, noise pollution, and contaminated compressed air hamper the growth of the market. Growing demand from emerging economies, and technological advancements are factors expected to provide numerous growth opportunities in the coming years.

**Request for sample copy of this report @**[**https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/air-compressor-market/request-for-sample**](https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/air-compressor-market/request-for-sample)

Air compressors are used to power a variety of equipment in diverse applications such as automated tools, spray painting equipment, material handling and separation equipment. There has been an increasing demand of energy efficient air compressor over the years. Use of energy efficient air compressors helps in conserving electricity and reducing costs. Thus, launch of energy efficient air compressors by leading players in the market would provide growth opportunities in the market.

**Turbocor and thermoacoustic are some emerging technologies in the air compressor segment. Compressors based on turbocor technology offer an oil free design with comparatively lesser moving parts, and deliver high performance and reliability. Thermoacoustic compressors utilize a thermoacoustic engine and a positive displacement reciprocating compressor. These upcoming technologies along with research and development would provide new opportunities in the air compressor market.**

Asia-Pacific generated the highest revenue in the market in 2017, and is expected to lead the global market throughout the forecast period. The presence of emerging industries such as healthcare, agriculture, construction, and automotive, substantial initiatives in research and development, and favorable government policies drive the market growth. Rapid industrialization and growth of manufacturing industry further support market growth in the region.

امسال نیز همچون سال های گذشته، مدیریت شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان شرایطی را ایجاد کردند که کارمندان و مدیران، مانند دوستانی دیرپا و قدیمی، در کنار یکدیگر جمع شده و لحظاتی شاد و به یاد ماندنی را تجربه کنند. نکته ای که بیش از همه برای مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر جای افتخار دارد، افزایش تعداد کارمندان و دوستان جدیدمان نسبت به سال گذشته است. به طوری که می توان گفت که جمعیت شرکت ایده برتر نسبت به همین مقطع در سال گذشته، دو برابر شده و با قدرت بیشتری به سمت موفقیت و آینده ای درخشان در حال حرکت است. از حضور تک تک دوستان در جمع مان خوشحالیم و به خود می بالیم که توانستیم لحظاتی هر چند کوتاه، شادی را به دل هایشان بیاوریم.

در کنار جشن یلدای 98، مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان از لوگوی جدید خود نیز رونمایی کرد. امیدواریم با استواری در مسیری که آغاز کرده ایم، روز به روز به پیشرفتمان ادامه داده و بتوانیم رضایت شما را بیش از پیش جلب نماییم.

To quote this article: https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it

“The bill would, in effect, allow unaccountable commissioners to set best practices making it illegal for online service providers (for chat, email, cloud storage, etc.) to provide end-to-end encryption -- something it is currently 100% legal for them to do under existing federal law, specifically CALEA. That is, the bill would make providers liable under one law for exercising their legal rights under a different law. Why isn’t this conflict with CALEA acknowledged anywhere in the bill? (We saw the exact same problem with the ill-fated Burr/Feinstein attempt to indirectly ban smartphone encryption.)”

1) United Arab Emirates &amp; Egypt:

Twitter removed a network of 267 accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt. They found evidence that these accounts were created and managed by DotDev, a private technology company operating in the UAE and Egypt. 
The company has permanently suspended DotDev, and all accounts associated with them. Twitter additionally suspended a separate group of 4258 accounts operating uniquely from the UAE, mainly directed at Qatar and Yemen. These accounts were often employing false personae and tweeting about regional issues, such as the Yemeni Civil War and the Houthi Movement.

2) Saudi Arabia:

Twitter also detected a small group of six accounts linked to Saudi Arabia’s state-run media apparatus which were engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government. 
While active, the accounts in this set presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government. 

Separately, Twitter has also permanently suspended the Twitter account of Saud al-Qahtani for violations of the manipulation policies.

3) Spain:

259 accounts falsely boosting public sentiment online in Spain were removed by Twitter. They were operated by Partido Popular, these accounts were active for a relatively short period, and consisted primarily of fake accounts engaging in spamming or retweet behaviour to increase engagement.

4) Ecuador:

Earlier in the summer, Twiter removed a network of 1019 accounts in Ecuador tied to the PAIS Alliance political party. The network, composed largely of fake accounts, was primarily engaged in spreading content about President Moreno’s administration, focusing on issues concerning Ecuadorian laws on freedom of speech, government censorship, and technology. Tactics most commonly used were hashtag manipulation and retweet spam.

5) China (PRC)/Hong Kong:

Twitter discloses  an additional datasets relating to 4,302 accounts which were most active in the Hong Kong information operation to further public awareness and understanding.New Twitter data disclosure to their archive of information operations"

Im sort of worried at the moment because if it is true and my parents have been doing that, it will make things extremely awkward. My parents aren't ""tech savvy"" but they aren't clueless either.

1,"World  Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cervical cancer is the fourth  most frequent cancer among women worldwide. India accounts for 16% of  global cervical cancer patients and an increase in demand for cervical  cancer demand has been worryingly seen.

SRL  Diagnostics is the largest diagnostics laboratory in India and they  receive around 100,000 pap smear samples every year. A cytopathologist  in their Mumbai laboratory alone screens around 200 slides for cervical  cancer every day in addition to 100 other slides for other types of  cancer.

To  solve the problem of the low proportion of cytopathologists available,  SRL Diagnostics partnered with Microsoft to create an AI network that  would have an API to enable screening out of normal slides, so that the  cytopathologists could concentrate on the abnormal slides. This would  give a huge boost in the overall speed of screening as only 2% of all  samples turn out to be abnormal and need deeper analysis. 

To develop the AI algorithm, cytopathologists studied digitally scanned versions of...

1,"Ok yes, in theory it gets you around geofences -- but youd have to have every company that has any site enabled with shared content to create separate websites for the EU. this would be a big expenditure and is in fact, not in line with their own interests (they pushed these laws here first and failed, so they went to the EU and paid them off)  


they WANT to control speech and information. but aside from that desire, businesses also are in the business of making money -- and erecting a great wall between the EU, China, and the rest of the internet would cost trillions in business losses as well as forcing them to hire a whole separate web development team for each region.  


in reality what will happen is there still will only be one site -- one site that follows the strictest set of laws. therefore there is no way around it without creating laws in teh US that criminalize doing online business with the EU WITHOUT creating such geofences period end.  


youd have to force them to invest more money into making less money by law.  


thats the only way.  


so when you log into the VPN it wont matter where you are. sure you could torrent all day and not get caught -- but thats different. you could access US sites but thats still different. US pay sites like netflix just offer different libraries and therefore are already geo-fenced so it works.  


however article 13 is a bigger threat because if i wanted to run a non-compliant reddit, for example, id have to block EVERY NATION THAT IS PART OF THE EU AND GIVE THEM A SEPARATE REDDIT.  


an alternative might be to flag every post and comment with a tag expressing the nation a person is from and straight up blocking 100% of content from other countries in the EU. so an EU poster wouldnt be able to see any of the replies but other people could see them.  


not only would this be a tremendous cost for users, but also businesses as the only people online in the EU would all be using VPNs and thus absolutely no money would go to EU licensing agencies and everyone would be a criminal there for intentionally avoiding the law.  


so i get it, your an influencer who cant get ad money because of tyranny. believe me i do, i wish i could imprison our governments. but the fact of the matter is, it wont get you around article 13 when/if it actually hits. we're all just screwed. unless the US government decides it wont extradite anyone for violating EU law and will totally disavow allies court systems.  


this is even more unrealistic to happen then the geofencing. but if any of us in the US care about this, its time to start protesting to implement oppressive to business laws that FORCE geofencing as a form of sanctions against the EU. we should be forcing every business who wants to have a website visible to the EU to create an entirely separate website, or otherwise complex scripts that in effect achieve the same effect.   


both will cost tons of money and require new teams of employees for massive amounts of businesses and increase the cost of doing business. both will decrease sales and increase sour feelings. but there really isnt another way and VPNs wont be a solution UNLESS that happens.why do so many people in europe now advertise VPNS as a way around article 13 -- they arent (not without heavy internet sanctions)"

1,"Blockchain for business is the new industrial revolution in 2020. It has become the hottest field in the technology sector now, empowering crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. There are few business owners in 2020 who exactly know the potential of Bitcoin technology, its far-reaching application beyond Bitcoin.

The adoption of [**Blockchain technology for businesses**](https://itobuz.com/blockchains/) requires time and effort. But business owners need to understand the reason behind the popularity of this technology.

📷

1. **Rise of Federated Blockchain** \- One of the latest trends of using Blockchain technology. Federated Blockchain provides private Blockchain for a more customizable outlook. It comes with some added features.

📷

2. **Stablecoins is going to dominate** \- Bitcoin, an example of cryptocurrency is highly volatile in nature. Stablecoins are created to provide a stable value associated with each Bitcoin. Blockchain will provide additional layers of security from currency crashes.

📷

3. **The Finance and Economy sector is adapting Blockchain applications** \- As per the PWC report, more than 77% of all financial institutions are expected to adopt Blockchain technology by 2020. This technology will help banks to decrease bureaucracy, faster transactions at a lower cost and improved secrecy.

📷

4. **Blockchain as a Service adapted by Tech services (BAAS)** \- Amazon and Microsoft have already implemented Blockchain as a Service platform. A cloud-based service that enables users to develop their own digital products using Blockchain applications.

📷

5. **Social Media Security enhancement with Blockchain** \- Blockchain technology is expected to solve all Social media issues like privacy violations, data threats, scandals, data control, and control relevance.

📷

6. **Blockchain combines with IoT** \- the Global number of IoT devices has already reached 26 Billion. The centralized architecture of IoT is one of the main reasons for its vulnerability. So device and IOT hacking will be common in 2020. Blockchain is public, so everyone can see who has participated in transactions. Moreover, it is decentralized and secure.

📷

7. **The demand for Blockchain experts** \- There are a few percentages of experts who are skilled in this technology. As it is widely spreading, it is creating opportunities for many to develop skills and experience about Blockchain Technology.

📷

8. **Blockchain and AI** \- Integration of AI with Blockchain will make for better development. Blockchain can make AI more understandable making it clear why decisions are made in machine learning.Why Blockchain technology is making a revolution in 2020?"

I come from Romania, Eastern Europe.

In a day like today september 4th, 21 years ago in 1998, [Larry Page](https://www.onthisday.com/people/larry-page) and [Sergey Brin](https://www.onthisday.com/people/sergey-brin), as two students at Stanford University, officially incorporated Google inc. the company. By that time Google was a simple search engine with no other functionality. The principal idea was to allow people to write “top 5 american singers” or any other query of one or two keywords and obtain a set of results based on such words. 

Who thought that Google would become one of the biggest enterprises in the world? Not to mention that it has been in the top for more than 10 years, innovating in many fields of the technological industry and almost monopolizing the worldwide web. Their aimed mission right now, as stated by themselves is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” even though this didn’t seem to be the idea, since Page and Brin first said  “We chose our systems name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines” letting us know that their outcome result surpassed their original idea by far. 

Are you one of the millions of people who uses google search engine? You may as well have a gmail or find places and navigate the world using google maps or google earth, talk to your friends with hangouts, shared photos and documents with google photos and google drive or set important events with google calendar. If you say no to all of these you probably still won't be able to say that you haven't seen a video on youtube which is by the way owned by google inc since november 2006 with 23.35 billions of visitors per month just after google search itself with 42.46 billions per month by july 2019 according to alexa ranking. 

Today should be a day to remember how big dreams can become a reality and how every person, no matter where they come from can become a creator and start building their own future step by step. 

Peter Ferdinand Drucker, an american educator and author, contributor to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation, once said that “the best way to predict the future is to create it” and he couldn't be more right. This is one of the purposes behind mintMe as a project, we want people to be able to mint their own future, giving them the tools they need to promote themselves and obtain real support from real people. 

To dream bigger also means that we have to do bigger, change our mindset to explore and be open to greater possibilities, and be willing to participate in promising projects with our eyes set on the future, looking forward to a success that may surpass our ideas.

However, when I moved over to the other Apple ID, I only have about 60 of my photos now and not all of them? 

Maybe it’s because I logged out twice from my main Apple ID and it didn’t get the chance to load them back in? I don’t understand how that’d work though because if they’re backed to the cloud they’re not gonna be on my phone if I switch to an alternative ICloud/Apple ID.

1,"Crossposting from another reddit since no answer to question.

When telemarketing calls were widespread in the US--and we used to get them  daily--there was a law years ago created for a nationwide do not call  list that forced business to check the list before attempting to call anyone. If your phone number was on the list, they were not permitted to call you unsolicited. When that law took effect, it reduced spam  callers by 98% because you could easily report them and they would be fined. Many are probably too young to remember this. A do not call list would be very similar to a do not track list (but browser setting).

What's stopping governments from implementing something that simple? Is there a technical reason? Or it could be gradual, starting with 3rd parties only-the browser setting could be do on track/share activities with 3rd  parties. If not, since Congress is working on updating privacy laws, this should be advocated. 

Why all the complicated privacy policies and cookie settings when this mechanism already exists since it's built into browsers.What if there was a law that ""do not track"" settings in browsers must be honored?"

Today, Donald Davis and Applied Intelligence issue the following statements regarding the lawsuit filed by Mr. Davis.  Neither party will make any further comment on the litigation or its resolution:

**Statements attributable to Donald Davis and Applied Intelligence:**

\*  Mr. Davis and Applied Intelligence have resolved their differences and have reached a resolution to the issues, dismissing the lawsuit.

\*  **As part of their resolution, the parties have agreed that Applied Intelligence will provide additional training to its human resources professionals, including on issues of caregiving and other family responsibilities.**

The remaining terms of the parties’ resolution are confidential.

\--------------------

**Statements attributable to Donald Davis:** 

\*  I sued because I felt I was discriminated against for being a caregiver, but I believe that Applied Intelligence wants to further a fair work environment for employees who have caregiving responsibilities.

\*  Applied Intelligence's new training program will help build a best-possible work environment for employees who are caregivers in their families, and especially for men who choose  non-traditional family roles.  I hope this new training will also break down stereotypes. 

\*  **I'm grateful that Applied Intelligence has taken my allegations seriously and has worked with me to resolve the case.  The resolution we have agreed to will mean that the employees of Applied Intelligence will receive additional resources on issues of caregiving and family responsibilities.**

\*  Applied Intelligence worked honorably with me to resolve the case and has shown a demonstrable commitment to making internal changes.  I believe Applied Intelligence is committed to protecting its employees who have caregiving and other family responsibilities.  I am proud to have played a part in this progress. 

\-----------------------

**Statements attributable to Applied Intelligence:** 

\*  **Applied Intelligence remains dedicated to ensuring a welcoming work environment for all of its employees, including those with caregiving and other family responsibilities.  In further support of its efforts, the company  is proud to provide additional training resources to its human resources professionals on these issues.**

\*  Applied Intelligence contested Mr. Davis’ claims throughout the litigation and has not admitted to any legal violations or other wrongdoing.  However, we are happy to put our differences behind us and appreciate Mr. Davis’ professionalism in working to resolve the parties’ differences. 

\*  Applied Intelligence is an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate on the basis of any characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws, including with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities or any other treatment during employment.Don Davis and BAE Systems Applied Intelligence US Corp Resolve Their Lawsuit with HR Training on Caregiving Issues"

1,"I know, this question is probably VERY STUPID. 
Of course it doesn't, it's glass. Probably. 

Story: my glass backed phone cracked and shattered recently. Trying to figure out if it would be worth fixing the damage, I came across some probably sketchy articles implying that phone radiation, wich may or may not be harmful, could actually go through the cracks. 

My critical part figured out that a thin layer of glass would not contribute any shielding in the first place, but still, I wanted to ask the community about it to decide on whether or not the repair is worth it, apart from obvious visual and structural advantages. 
(Also, to calm my hypochondriac mind)

Thanks for reading! :)Does smartphone glass protect from radiation?"

1,"I don’t know if this is an appropriate place to ask, but I am wondering if there are any video chat apps that have an option to convert voice to text as captions?

My family is very separated and my mother is very hard of hearing. We can all FaceTime but she is left not able to interact. She does not know sign language. As a result, we mostly text, but my father finds video easier as he is not as quick to text as the rest of us.

I am looking for an app that allows for blended communication so that we can all video chat, my mother can keep up with a voice to text caption, and keep engaging. This will allow her to see her young grandchildren, also. I know voice to text isn’t perfect, but even an imperfect solution provides enough context cues to be able to help her engage.

Does anyone have a suggestion, or is there an option in any existing video chat apps that I should be enabling? My parents are seniors but generally tech savvy. Our issue is really with the need to blend technologies for each of their needs.

Well I wanted to post because a few weeks ago I was joking about putting my mother in a nursing home. She doesn't actually need to be in one, and I've never searched for nursing homes. We don't even live in the same area. I got ads a few hours later for nursing homes in my area. 

That still didn't convince me 100%, I'm not sure why but I questioned my sanity. Maybe I'm making things up and I didn't really make that joke lol. I did but you get the point. 

So earlier tonight, I work in a hospital. I walked out to my car and an uber pulled up in front of the ER to pick up a patient. The patient walked out and said ""hey are you uber? I have to fit my wheelchair in the back"" I was about 5 feet from the guy. Phone was in my hand. I thought how is that guy going to fit his wheelchair in that car lol.

Well, a few hours later I have an add on my phone for wheelchair accessible uber's. I do not use uber, and I don't have a wheelchair or search anything wheelchair related on the interwebz. 

There is absolutely no way our phones do not listen to us and analyze for add words in real time. Do people still disagree? Am I crazy?Are our phones always listening?"

1,"I’m 100% not about it personally.

For me i love being able to simply say “fuck this place I’m out”. For example my first job out of college was there for two years, not to brag but i was better at the technical portions of my job than the “senior” developer. Mainly because he was older and didn’t want to adapt to new ways of doing thing, hell he insisted every api connection be done in SOAP because “rest was too new and untested”..... this was only 8 years ago...

Anyhoo i got a promotion and raise within that two years, but there was a nepotism hire who came in at my level and at a hire salary. So that weekend i looked for other jobs, within a month i had gone through a handful of interviews and picked one that gave me a 50% raise, better benefits, and travel (consulting), a few years later after i got sick of that i got another promotion(new job) with another huge “raise”, free food, better benefits, a free gym.

Loyalty to company is a morons game, being a mercenary is literally cash money. 


Now why I’m against unions in the sector i work in:

My dad and grandfather where both union men. Union jobs are hard to get into, onboarding is bitch, and they’re set up with the expectations you’d work there for the rest of your life. Seniority is given far too much value compared to skill set or knowledge. They also drastically reduce labor mobility, so being a code mercenary would be incredibly difficult. Right now at any moment i can drop this job and shift right into consulting, if everything was unionized my ability to do that would be significantly reduced.

It benefits the old and connected to the detriment of the young. Sure if you’re the kind of guy who wants to do the same thing for 30 years i guess you’d like it; who’s happy with small raises here and there.


That’s not even touching on the politics of it all.How do you guys feel about unions trying to push into tech?"

I would like to come out and say that who ever thought that needed to be a thing needs to be shot.  Our freedom is going to be destroyed by this design and he even told me that we're going to have these barcodes on us in which we can't buy food or anything without it.  We don't need this and it needs to be legalized and the idiots who thought this was a good idea needs to be fired and arrested.

Hearing these news did confirm one thing for me: I now officially have nothing but contempt for humanity and it's clear that the future is will be nothing but slavery and despair.We Don't Need Microchips on our person"

1,"So I'm not really sure if this is the right place but I don't really know where else to go... I guess I'll just get right into it. It's a little long... Just so you know.

I'm 29 years old, I've lived in Phoenix, AZ most of my life but I have travelled and lived in other states and even other countries [Korea, Norway]. Today's technology is... Depressing. And it's not that I don't like the direction technology is moving [sort of], it's more that I have this strange phenomenon where shit literally craps out on me or starts doing shit that I didn't tell it to do on a near constant basis. It's almost daily at this point that some electronic device in my life doesn't fucking work the way it's supposed to, even if it's brand new. And I'm not technologically illiterate; my girlfriend has grown tired of my bitching and anger about it that she's started monitoring me like a prison guard to make sure I'm not an idiot with modern  technology like cell phones or video game consoles or computers and whatever else a modern young person would have in their home. She's confirmed I'm doing everything correctly yet witnessed MANY times that it just simply malfunctions with no real reason behind it. But the second SHE tries to do the same thing as me, whatever device is being used, works perfectly fine the second it leaves my fucking hands. Several weeks ago she finally admitted this kind of this does happen to me at an unusually high frequency...

Here's an example [and a quite recent one] Before she moved in with me she had this security camera with a phone app that worked amazingly well. She installed it at my place when she moved in with me and I downloaded the app so we both have access to it, and within several months it just completely stopped working altogether. The manufacturer has diagnosed it themselves and straight up told us they honestly have no idea why it stopped working, there's no damage to it at all in any way and they've had ZERO other incidents like this.

This has been happening to me for almost ten years now, it even effected me with some military equipment when I was in the Army in my early twenties. I don't know what the fuck is going but it's becoming extremely difficult for me to live in a world so heavily dependent on modern technology but every time I get MY hands on it, it craps out on me.

Last incident was last night and now I think it's starting to impact my relationship... I guess my girlfriend was just trying to make me feel better before because last night she told me that this happens to everyone and I just have an extremely low tolerance for it... I've NEVER met a single person who has this happen to them with such severe consistency that it makes daily life a goddamn struggle because you literally cannot survive in the modern world today without technology... I'm honestly trying, I'm young, I grew up with a father who made decent money so we always had the most up to date tech in our home, I don't have a personal problem with any of it [except for autonomy but that's not part of my personal life so it's irrelevant here]. I don't buy cheap shit either, I have expensive taste and I take care of the things I buy...

I don't understand what's going on. There's no where I can go where I can get away from it all and have a normal daily life, the world literally forces you to adapt or... Well there is no other option. I don't know how much more of this I can take...Trouble adapting to modern technology..."

Supplementation  with 200 IU per day vitamin E did not have a statistically significant  effect on lower respiratory infections in elderly nursing home  residents. However, we observed a protective effect of vitamin E  supplementation on upper respiratory infections, particularly the common  cold, that merits further investigation.

Because  of the high rate and increased morbidity associated with common colds  in this age group, these findings suggest important implications for the  well-being of the elderly and for the economic burden associated with  their care. Future studies in the elderly should address the effect of E  supplementation on the common cold and incorporate microbiological  methods to allow for assessment of the impact of vitamin E on specific  types of respiratory pathogens.

I'd like to ask for your feedback on the website that provides an easy way to learn about the best latest tech products.

It is hard to learn about the latest tech products without sifting through lots and lots of data, junk, and spammy posts.

That's why I created a website that allows you to watch the endless stream of the best latest tech product videos:

https://productvideos.tech/

You can go to the website, click play, sit back and enjoy the stream of the latest awesome technology on your screen.

You can also play it in the background because every video in the stream has a voice over.

You can play it when you're working, cooking food, working out in the gym, etc.

Do you like this way of learning about tech products or not?

Please go to the website, play the stream and write your answer in the comments.New easy way to learn about the best latest tech products."

1,"It’s almost entirely anecdotal at this point but when I noticed the FB app was using my location quite a lot, I started routinely force quitting the app after use so it wasn’t running in the background. 

Ever since I started doing that, the number of notifications I get pushed has increased dramatically. From c. 2-3 per day to 20+ per day. More when the app is closed than when the app runs in the background.

I wondered, has anybody else replicated/noticed this behaviour? Is this built into the app so we’re more likely to leave the app running in the background all the time when we forget to shut it down?

Is the app trying to stay alive in the background for better monitoring purposes... or... am I crazy? :)Does the Facebook app generate notifications more frequently when the app is closed to increase the chance of being left running in the background?"

People aren’t perfect and I’m ok with that. I’d rather us just accept and appreciate our imperfections and differences rather than try to genetically engineer and augment everyone to be perfect. It’d be boring as fuck if we all looked the same and it doesn’t stop there. If all of our thoughts are uploaded to computers, we’d have no privacy and individuality anymore. We’d be part of the internet fully and become one big hive mind. People with power can alter us so we all think the same too. Robots would do all the work so we’d be even lazier than we are now. I wouldn’t want my brain chipped so I can know everything and read minds. Call me crazy but I enjoy being human, the highs and the lows.

Big data is characterized as the data that can not be prepared by customary methods and systems, because of its large size and complexity. The word Big in big data means petabytes or exabytes of data. It is calculated that nearly 90% of the data that we have today has been generated in the last two years. This implies; exponential growth in data volume is going to proceed. This growth will increase further with the increase in IoT (Internet Of Things).

Data analytics mainly uses Big Data. It gives necessary insights into business operations of any business. It helps businesses in growth, competitiveness and profitability.

## Need of Big Data –

There are many challenges for handling a huge data in applications. Big data is no longer growing trend. This is now time-tested, accepted with a sound, secure, stable architecture. It is synchronized with information, generating efficient analytics by organizations, ranging from data oriented start-ups to big technology giants around the globe. There are many tools on the internet, there is considerably more to it than Big Data alone.

If you hold a large amount of various data, and from this you need to find out answers at fast, you may look at the opening gates called “the three V’s” of the data. This means that you are ready to look at better solutions that fulfils your need of data. Can you say that it is enough? Of course not.

Do you want to turn your existing application asset to a bigger store for a theoretically possible performance? How big are your existing data security issues and how would you deal with the same on the new infrastructure? Is your data “big” enough for these solutions? Such questions carry you to a point where you have to think about a couple of significant things. You realize that first, the idea of building an efficient big data infrastructure, lies the need to build a decision on whether to present a big data infrastructure or not.

## Why you should need big data in an organization?

Organizations or businesses requires a big data services to allow them to survive in a fast growing and increasingly competitive market where the sources and the requirements to store data are growing at exponential manner. To handle high volumes, the data storage should be elastic and scalable. Cloud based storage is a better idea for most businesses because it reduces investments. There are no physical systems on site, means that it saves space and power consumption. It handles the data security issues. You require tools to enable virtualization and carry out data compression. You should require object-based storage architecture to handle a large amount of files. organizations are looking out for the solution that can store complex unstructured data and which do not have predefined schemas.

Big Data solutions do not force a schema onto the stored data. Instead you can store any type of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data and then apply a suitable schema when you query this data. Big data solutions store data in raw format and apply a schema only when the data is read. This preserves all information within the data. This is contradictory to the way of traditional database.

## Data Magnitude Determination-

In 1997, the first documented use of the term “big data” appeared in paper by scientists at NASA. It describes the problem facing by them with visualization. Generally data sets are large, taxing the capacities of main memory, local disk and remote disk. This problem is Big Data. When there is a situation like data sets don’t fit in main memory, or when they do not fit on local disk also, in such cases the solution is to acquire more resources.

Another most important factor is what you want to do with the data. The problem is big data solutions is that they are numerous. Getting the perfect tool is important for the cost, efficiency and delivery constraints also. Creating an understanding of these factors is a main requirement of big data infrastructure requirements.

## Necessity of Advanced Analytics-

An interesting thing that gives thought on analytics is- one of the financial services firm which turned to big data to better identify which new client opportunities warrant the most investment. The organization enhanced its client statistic information with third party data purchased from eBureau. The data service provider appended sales lead opportunities with buyer’s occupation, earnings, age, retail histories and also related factors. The advanced data set is then applied to an algorithm. This identifies which new client leads should receive additional investment and which should not. The result has been 11% hike in new client win rates. At the similar instance, the firm has lowered sales related expenses by 14.5%. 

There are some benefits that big data analytics offer are – Getting answers to complex business problems, creating cost effective requirements to bring in more customers, analyzing existing values to predict faster and better business decisions, and also exploiting machine learning analytics to make self learning systems.

## Right time for data transition and security issues-

Data-driven transition must start with your business goals and also objectives. As you understand your business objectives then you are ready to create a roadmap for leveraging new data sources to help you achieve them. Also, technology is not only enough to transform your organization into a data-driven organization. Creating a platform that understands data, securing the data and how to use it is just as necessary. The challenge of detecting and also preventing advanced persistent threats has bought the importance of security responsibilities in light.Deciding the need of a Big Data Infrastructure"

1,"Since the internet began, people have uploaded and published over a trillion gigabytes of digital content that includes music, games, movies, and much more. The rapid advancements in the digital age and the internet have undoubtedly served content creators and publishers with lots of opportunities to make profits and revenue but along with challenges such as violation of their data online. Indeed, [**Copyright Infringement**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/copyright) is one of the biggest challenges that the digital world faces in the present era. To stop the continuous increase in widespread unlawful access to copyrighted materials observed in the 1990s, the US government put a step and came up with a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Abbreviated as DMCA, this law is a result of the teamwork of legislators, media firms, and consumer lawyers, and enacted by the US Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1998. The law was made on request of many organizations requested for a legal process by which holder of [**Copyright Website**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/copyright), content, or image could assert their rights to prevent the illegal use of their media. Apart from providing the copyright holders with these facilities, DMCA aims to maintain a balance between the interests of original owners and those who want to purchase the copyrighted materials. It also takes care of penalties to be put on offenders who intentionally violate any [**Intellectual Property**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/) (IP).

**DMCA Takedown Notice**

Resting as the main component of DMCA law, DMCA takedown notice is an official notification to inform the firm, search engine, web host, or internet service provider (ISP) that they are using copyrighted material. As, in the legal sense, such use is unlawful and leads to copyright infringement, the site or company who receives this notice should immediately take down the specific material. In case they avoid doing so, the ISP could forcefully remove the copyrighted content. You can send the DMCA notice or request for the following types of copyright content:

&amp;#x200B;

* Videos,
* Digital software,
* Artwork, images, photos,
* Posts on your official websites,
* Songs, music, and almost every      kind of audio files,
* Written texts, including books,      poetry, articles, blogs, etc.

**Registration of Work Isn’t Necessary**

When it comes to write or send a DMCA notice, it is not mandatory to register your work. Any unique content becomes its owner’s IP as soon as he/she creates it. And, as the original owner holds the copyright to it from the moment of its creation, he/she can send a DMCA notice in regards to it without bothering about [**Copyright Registration**](https://www.trademarkmaldives.com/copyright). DMCA takedown request is one of the politest ways to prevent infringement of any unregistered material, but don’t forget that if you want to go for a copyright infringement lawsuit, then it is essential to register your content with the copyright office.

**Procedure to Create DMCA Notice**

As per the law, there is no official DMCA takedown notice form or template that copyright owners are needed to use. However, to make the requests valid, each plaintiff (sender of the notice) must consider including certain specifications. Besides providing info that showcases the copyright infringement, the notice should include:

&amp;#x200B;

* All the details related to the      content that’s being infringed
* A statement that the sender has      a good faith that the party on the receiving end has infringed his/her      content
* A statement that under penalty      of perjury, every detail provided in the takedown notice is precise
* Sender’s contact information
* Sender’s physical or electronic      signature

**Don’t Worry If You Receive a DMCA Takedown Notice**

Considering the legal standing, receiving a DMCA takedown notice undoubtedly sounds a bit scary, but being worried or scared is not at all a solution. What you should do in such cases is first of all calm down and be honest to yourself. After that, think whether or not you infringed the copyrighted material intentionally. Usually, there are high possibilities that you didn’t steal or post the content intentionally. Nevertheless, if you find yourself guilty of infringing the material, then rectifying your mistake will be the best solution. Be quick to locate and take down the violated content as soon as you could. In some cases where you host multiple websites with various people posting and sharing content, there are probabilities that you receive the notice as the next logical person to contact while the infringement was committed by any of those people. Other likelihoods could be that you are using the copyrighted content cautiously within the boundaries of Fair Use. If that’s so, then contact the sender of the notice and share the details of how you used his/her content. It will help you in sorting the issue with ease.

**Conclusion**

Nowadays, when powerful tools like DMCA are here to help you fight back the infringers, there is no need to stand like helpless in situations when they steal or use your copyrighted content. When these tools have been designed to serve you, then why not utilize them and extract the benefits that you deserve. From today onwards, be active and understand the rights you hold over your copyrighted content and ways to utilize them in the best possible manner.

1,"I wasn't sure where to post this, just wanted to share my discontent with the new Facebook changes.

On desktop I can no longer click the timestamp to open a video if I want to get it's link or bookmark it, otherwise it's just gonna open the new Watch feature with a completely unrelated link. Now I have to either click ""X comments"" and delete the ""comment\_tracking"" part of the link or, when there are no comments (it happened a few times), the only option is to click the Share button, send as message and then get the link.

They just added unecessary extra steps, but I can live with that since it's just for videos and it's not that complicated either. The real problem is what they're doing to the mobile version. I haven't used the Facebook app in ages because of the necessity to install 2 different apps (one for seeing posts and other for messenger) and the mobile browser version has been a great alternative so far, but a few months ago they just made it impossible for users to ""right-click"" anything on their website in order to open stuff in a new tab. Now the user has to click the post, copy the link, return, open a new tab, paste the link, and hope the timeline didn't reset (happens most of the times). That's a really stupid move, why complicate things? Even the desktop version (when you click request desktop site on your mobile browser) isn't working, as anything you try to open in a new tab will just open your timeline instead.

Is anyone else annoyed by this? Have you found a better solution to mitigate these stupid changes? Thanks in advance.Facebook's UI just keeps getting worse, what's going on?"

Lucky for me, I'm not a big internet surfer. I  rarely click on links, and don't even accept mms text messages. My limited online lifestyle has made it easy for me to narrow it down to less than 10 possible sites that may contain the culprit(s). To say that I am having major tech issues right now, across the board is a major understatement. All of my phones, even the brand-new one, have all required factory resets on multiple occasions. That said, I've lost EVERYTHING. Again, and again. They all went out the same way: a blinking, repetitive boot screen. Certain sites won't load at the most inopportune times, and my touchscreen (PC and phone) will stop working, as if I have given up control of it.

I am regularly changing my email passwords, because the login issues are non-stop. In fact, someone turned-off my two-step verification 3 days ago! Not to mention, someone logged into my Film Freeway account and changed my film project name. I could take hours making edits, formatting and adding updates, only to go back and find new typos that weren't there before, and the entire document reformatted incorrectly. Would you believe that I tried to log in to my LinkedIn account to get information for a possible job lead, only to find that the entire site comes up in  a different language? I tried going through my custom URL, the search engine and each time it would appear in a foreign language. Just for fun, they hijacked my debit card too, by cancellation a purchase transaction at the pump, cleaning me out completely. I had to wait (an unheard of) two weeks to get my money back. 

There were about 3 or 3 years I spent collecting losing lottery tickets, in order to submit them for second chance drawings. I have to have entered at least 200 tickets. Since this whole technical difficulty all started with getting locked out of Gmail, I can't help but to wonder if that's what happened. Like, did I win and someone hijacked my account? It would make sense because the state lottery has been requesting ID verification and has locked me out of my account with them as well. That reminds me, there are multiple FB and Twitter accounts under my name, but without the ""s."" I've reported the accounts as bogus, but nothing ever happens to them. Then one day, after I wrote my first book, I did a search and found a YouTube video of a teacher in Canada with my same name. Which I find odd .because I've literally been Google'ing myself every week since 2012. Outside of that video, there is no other record of her. 

I can almost live with all of that's happened, but what ruined me for the rest of my life, was when my computer got hacked and the bitlocker was activated. I wasn't even online!! I'm a writer, and I had given up everything to work full-time as a writer. I wrote 4 books, 2 shorts and 6 feature films over the course of two years, all of which may very well be irretrievable. This, is what has changed me as a person; what has destroyed my ability to trust. I don't know that I'll ever come to grips with what's happened, but I want to tell the world what's happened to me, in the event that I run into a ""freak accident"" and my work ends up on screens around the world with someone else's name on it. (Some copyright content from my 1st book is actually being aired on Netflix, without my permission if you can believe that.) I haven't even gone into my disappearing posts, books and articles--or how my follower count won't increase after receiving new followers all the time. 

WTH !?!?

I don't know if it's a single person, or an organized group but I am definitely a target. If I was rich, I wouldn't care, but I'm not. I live in my SUV with two pets, barely eating and with barely any gas in the tank. My days are spent looking for somewhere to use a decent restroom, while someone is getting rich off of my blood, sweat and tears. To me, the whole design is created as if to discredit me, or cause me to fail. Like they want me to give up and go away, so they can cash in on my work. I don't understand the inhumanity, and lack of compassion. I don't understand why, but I honestly don't care to try to understand anymore. I just want to get law enforcement involved and be done with it all so I can move on with my life. I can't be the only one this is happening to, am I? What do I do???Who is policing the web? Should I get a police report or...?"

1,"Hi. Not sure of the best place for something like this to be posted... apologies if this isn't the best place though.

I'm an admin to one of my cities larger community-run Facebook groups... and a few days ago we started getting multiple-at-a-time join requests by obvious fake profiles. 

I didn't think anything of it at first. I simply declined/blocked the request and moved on. A few hours later, a few more attempted joining. I thought it was a bit odd, and then noticed they (along with the previous fake accounts) were all a member of this random Facebook group (allegedly some company based out of Vietnam.) Digging deeper, I noticed all of the accounts also followed the same user account.

It's been a few days of getting bombarded with requests from this group. 4 every few hours. I've been blocking them and reporting their accounts as fake. Facebook has continued to 'review the report', coming back that the accounts don't break any community standards.

All of the accounts follow a similar pattern. They all change their cover photo, and then upload a picture of an attractive women. The oddness of it all, is that when researching this group (who is growing at 10k a day of fake accounts...) they're all 'from' various local towns and cities in various states.

Examples:

&gt; Lives in Peoria, Illinois...

&gt; From Kansas City, Missouri

--

&gt; Rapid City, South Dakota

&gt; Studied at San Bernardino, California

&gt; Went to Baton Rouge, Louisiana

&gt; Lives in Portland, Oregon

&gt; From Durham, North Carolina

I've seen similar bot accounts on Twitter, and Instagram... but they're typically pushing a malicious link or something. These accounts are being created and lying dormant. They don't seem to be spreading any content yet.

It's eerily similar to stuff that was discovered during the Mueller investigation. Fake accounts joining groups, that would be later used to spread discourse, or misinformation.

I'm curious if anybody has had any real experience dealing with something similar, and if they've had any experience in contacting Facebook to get them pay any actual attention to it.

Just a handful of these accounts. All of which are clearly fake accounts.

1,"# Edge computing, unlike most new technologies, is not defined by what it is, but where.

According to IBM, ""**Edge computing** places network-computing resources as close as possible to where data is created."" This means less central infrastructure, local data processing and faster systems overall.

**At present, most companies use one of three types of network solutions:**

* **Premises:** Data centers have large server racks that are owned and operated by the user.
* **Colocation:** customer equipment is hosted in a fully managed building where power, cooling, and connection are provided as services.
* **Cloud:** customer infrastructure is partially virtualized, enabling solutions and applications to be provided through a truly as-a-service model.

Where **edge computing** differs from these options is in the use of portable ""micro"" data centers and smaller servers to allow massive reductions in the distance between the processing point and the functionality consumption point in the network.

This means benefits such as minimum latency, simplified maintenance and less money spent on cooling. Grand View Research predicts that by 2024 the global edge computing market will reach more than $ 28 billion. Gigabit magazine analyzes some of the applications that are pushing us towards a future with advanced computing capacity.

**The benefits that 5G adoption can offer are myriad -** it is promoted as the key to unlocking everything from the infrastructure of the smart city and cloud games to autonomous vehicles and smart automation. With respect to the Internet of things, 5G is expected to increase exponentially the number of smart devices connected in the next decade. That is a significant increase in the demand for currently centralized networks.

At the Total Telecom 2019 Congress earlier this year, representatives from BT, CenturyLink, STL Partners, and Vodafone spoke with confidence about the indispensable role that cutting-edge computing will play in improving 5G to a point that supports a commercial case for the mass adoption

""It's no secret that the commercial argument for 5G is a bit unstable,"" said Dalia Adib, Practice Leader, **Edge Computing,** at STL Partners. “Many operators are looking for other ways to generate value for customers and within 5G, there is great potential in the business space, so the edge provides a springboard to start discussions with those customers, build relationships and create services that 5G could allow in the future that edge can be achieved today. ""

Paul Savill, SVP, Core Network, and Technology Solutions, at CenturyLink, agreed and noted that “5G absolutely needs edge more than edge needs 5G. The reason is that you can take advantage of it without 5G, but if you implement 5G and you don't have an edge strategy, you will lose a large part of the market opportunity. ""

# Cloud games

With the global growth of mobile games, along with the endless search for more powerful software and graphics to support an increasingly luxurious and deep gaming experience, 2019 has been the year in which cloud games emerged to position themselves as the apparent heir of interactive entertainment.

Project xCloud from Microsoft and Google Stadia have started testing this year, and a number of smaller companies, such as Blade (which has just raised $ 32mn to support the development of its cloud gaming service, Shadow) are also starting to fill the market with viable options.

However, the limitations of current network capabilities are holding back the adoption of technology, which basically requires that a 5G connection be fast enough to transmit a game from the cloud and to the user's phone with sufficient immediacy to create an experience of the viable game.

In combination with the massive 5G deployments, the drastic latency reductions that edge computing can provide will be an essential part of bringing cloud games to the mainstream.

# Augmented and mixed reality

""There is a great deal of innovation in the pipeline. But few concepts rival the potential of augmented reality. AR will soon get mass adoption and permeate the business and consumer markets. Edge computing will allow new levels of user participation to be performed locally on AR devices. Through better computer processing, users can expect to see more vivid and faster AR experiences in the near future, ”says Marc Fischer of Dogtown Media.

Also closely related to improvements in 5G connectivity and the greater computing power of the cloud, the increase in AR capabilities will depend largely on immediate responses, in order to map experiences and information seamlessly in a physical environment. The technical benefits of state-of-the-art computing, both for 5G and for cloud computing in general, will be a massive engine of mixed reality solutions, both in the commercial and consumer spaces.Why we need Edge Computing?"

The phones never really let me down, everything about it still works well. It’s fast and responsive but the battery has now gotten to the point where it cannot go a full day without being charged at least 5 times a day. 

I decided to do a bit of research on getting a new battery from amazon and I found a 3600mAh battery that I bought. 

I’m just curious if anyone out there has replaced their phones battery and what feedback you have to give.

Interestingly, Artificial intelligence has already changed the global economy and is believed to be adding on 16%, which is nearly $13 trillion to the current global economic output by 2030.

Despite technology advancements and the hype going around, it is still quite challenging to answer some of the questions like — are we heading towards recession?

I work for a small family business (20 employees) and we are considering updating our hardware - computers, monitors, keyboards, mouses. We have the budget for basically anything but our IT guy apparently ""custom built"" our existing computers and thinks new computers are not necessary. We are operating on 2013-2016 desktops - mostly low-end Dells.

The are SLOW compared to my old jobs and I can't tell if I'm a spoiled millennial or if these are actually bad computers. We download lots of e-docs, work off a online CRM, and handle a lot of emails throughout the day. Everyones computers lag when loading or opening lots of windows.

The response from our guy regarding computer speed was ""desktop computers haven't changed much in the last 5 years"" This was a red flag for me but is he right? I'm wondering should we trust this guy? What is the best approachShould I trust my small-business IT guy?"

People think that merely covering visible camera solves anything.  
They can build them into anything, from computer display to TV, notebook, tablet or even a smartphone.

This thing looks like purposefully built option for every module:

* it has to be very thin, so it uses fresnell lens
* since it is between LCD and backlight, it is flooded with visible light, so it mostly operates in IR spectrum
* if space permits, it can have IR flash (LED)
* it can have NFC communication side\_channel as main, only or additional channel
* usually  that secondary channel is NFC. It can be  triggered by a coded pulse  and its signal is meant to be received with Software Defined Radio or  similar device. There is usually no space for purpose transmitter &amp;  antenna, so the chip uses what it has, usually some traces that are laid  in available space.
* if/when given equipment doesn’t support such spycam as manufactured, simple unit can be built-in afterwards.
* it can capture video through main channel and snaps through secondary channel
* capturing  video and photos in well\_lit environment seems seamless, without any  visible disturbance. For usage of the built-in flash, it seems to have  to transition to all black frame momentarily.
* it can have complete sensor set. Along with video, it can capture audio, temperature, movement (MEMS) etc.

Question:

Would a visible circular polariser in front of such unit foil light path in reverse direction ?I’m  talking about those foils that 3M produces and used to be sold as  screen filter for CRTs long ago. It looks like a simple foil and could  be incorporated in front side of cheap protective wrap...Question WRT to planted in-panel spy cameras..."

1,"It’s not that I won’t get into it but it’s an extremely long and complicated situation where I have spent so much time looking into it and never getting any information out of it. If more info is need then by all means I will get into it. 
So in short, I am being followed by a group of people either in cars or on foot. ( let me just also add real quick that whatever I state here is without exaggeration). Within a couple of minutes of leaving my house it starts. I can only assume my house is being watched from a place that I haven’t figured out yet. The quickness of them make me believe that there could be a listening device or something in my house where they are able to tell when I’m getting ready to leave.  So in short my question to this is how can I find out?
My second, and almost more important issue is trying to figure out if my phone is tapped, hacked, or connecting to a stingray tower. Again, without getting deep into it there are just way too many coincidences happening.

(Cell, LTE Data, and 20 gigs each month). Now that’s kind of a lot for someone who can’t even access the web if not connected to my own Wi-Fi. On top of that the T-mobile store by my house told me an outright lie about a tower being down when an Engineer from tech support on the phone said that just wasn’t true. ( besides the fact my wife and kids have the same phone on the same plan as me and have not a single issue with their service). I have gotten a phone replacement from Apple which worked perfect for 2 or 3 days then the same issues started. Then I got a new SIM card from T-Mobile and again great for 2/3 days then the issues start. There are many more things but like I said would prefer not to get into it all as already this post is much longer that I wanted. Oh and also I have gotten a few voicemails where when I listen to it it’s just a phone ringing with someone else answering the phone saying ‘hello’ a couple of times then hanging up. Please help with any information anyone could provide. THANK YOU. I will also answer any question where an answer would be helpful to your response.Ok, I have a bit of a situation that I’m looking into but wondering if a few questions could be answered without getting into the entire issue."

One of the most concerning parts is that their CEO has previously made phishing applications and computer viruses that got him into legal trouble with the law. How can anyone trust him with the personal information of billions of people after that?

There have already been reports of their software used for stalking, and other reports of false arrests being made because of it. This makes me afraid of what is to come once it becomes more widely used around the world. 

www.engadget.com/amp/2020/02/12/clearview-ai-police-surveillance-explained/

This is a huge threat to everyone's privacy, and I believe that in using private photos they have infringed on intellectual property rights by using photos that do not belong to them. Under copyright law the owner of the photos has exclusive rights to the photographs and Clearview AI was never given permission to use many of the photos that they have stolen.

Is there anything we can do to prevent this theft and to shut down this company before it's too late? 

I refuse to play a role in the creation of a dystopian police state and I believe that the protection of our privacy is something everyone should be worried and speaking out about.


Thank you for everyone who has taken their time to read through this post, and I really hope that we are able to do something about this terrible startup.Clearview AI and why we must take a stand!"

Is technology a bane or a boon? Well, the debate will go on. However, it’s for the students to decide whether technology has been beneficial for them when it comes to gaining a detailed insight into a subject matter.

We all know textbook knowledge is not sufficient for solving assignments, like if you are aiming to provide annotated bibliographies. You would need to browse through online resources to include insightful information in your tasks. Thus, technology plays a pivotal role in supplementing education, just like a prescribed pill (such as vitamins) act as a supplement diet.

I’ve recently been interested in buying a new laptop. I’d use it, like the title says, for programming, music production, and the occasional video game. 

I’ve heard that for programming, Mac is typically better in terms of ease because of its Unix roots. I’m a Linux guy so this is important, although I’ve heard that Windows offers some killer linux emulators. Is this true? Which would be easiest?

I’ve heard that in terms of music production, Mac and Windows are pretty equal. Is this true?

Finally, for gaming, Windows is dominant over Mac typically. Does this matter or not really?

The reason I’m hesitant to buy a Windows laptop is because I’ve heard some horror stories about programming on Windows and just Windows in general.

I’m unfamiliar with the Mac’s interface and I’m hesitant to buy one because I rarely see people interested in InfoSec using them. I’d definitely want to be able to use Kali Tools and have no idea if its possible on Mac.

A new robotic system is able to automatically classify oranges. By means of ABB industrial robots and artificial vision techniques, the classification of these fruits is automated according to their size and degree of maturity, to store and transport them to the commercialization points.

As part of the final project of the Robotics course taught by Professor Pedro Cárdenas, of the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering of the National University of Colombia (UNAL), students attended the mission of developing an application of industrial robotics for the agricultural sector, as close as possible to reality

In this case, an attempt was made to design a gripper, or clamp to pick oranges, and integrate it into a system to automatically classify them.The reason for the Mechatronics Engineering understudies  was proportional up on a modern level what they had accomplished before with a strawberry sorter created at Lego Mindstorms.

For this they used a depth camera - like the Kinect of the Xbox 360 video game console - to detect where the fruits are, a transport band for the output of the material, two ABB robots - which usually have different factories -, and a tool designed..[.(More)](https://technothiest.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-robotic-system-classifies-oranges.html)A Robotic System Classifies Oranges"

Something that was broached in discussions recently was internet connectivity from these vehicles.  

Hotspots came to mind, there's many different varieties these days but since it'd be of a huge benefit to the employees, the thing I want to ask about is Wifi range. Say, a couple hundred feet outdoors.

I'm looking for suggestions on which hardware to go with that might allow for external antenna, for the cellular side of things but also something that might provide at least a hundred (more is better) feet of wifi range for the laptops.. from the vehicle.

This would allow the field guys to more accurately and more efficiently upload scan data to our servers.

I paid a visit to the Google and found the Netgear Nighthawk M1. Looks good so far... I'll get into a call soon with a sales rep but I'm hoping for feedback from the community here on either is this a decent choice, or advice on other avenues or approach.

Hi !

So recently i got curious about all this deepweb stuff and wanted to experience by myself what it looks like down there. As i'm quite cautious, i thought of some combination of OS/VM/VPN to experience the deep web the safest and most anonymous way possible. The thing is, after some reaserches, i couldn't fine clear answers that were adapted to nowadays threats and tech. solutions to these threats, and that's why i'm here.

The method i thought would be the safest was to install a NATed virtualbox runing with debian and then a vpn on debian.

So starting from there i have few questions (**regarding safety and anonymity at all levels, down to hardware**):

**-0) Is this setup even useful when it comes to safety and anonymity at all levels down to hardware ?**

**-1) VM**  
A) Is VirtualBox the best VM for browsing the deepweb in terms of security ? If not, is it useful to use a type 1 VM (specialy to protect my hardware ID) ?  
B) Is it possible **and useful** to make my VM run on a USB key (64GB) ?  
C) Is NAT the safest VM/Host relation ?  
D) Is it possible **and useful** to have my VM connected to another gateway, diferent from my host's one ?  
E) Is there anything i should know or any point i'm missing ?

**-2) OS**  
A) What is the best OS in terms of **safety and anonymity** ? (concidering the VM questions are already treated)

**-3) VPN**  
A) What's the best VPN i can get regarding to my aims ? (Is it from a private company ? if yes is it expensive ?)

**-4) Is there some other thing than VM/OS/VPN that i'm missing and that can be useful ?**

Thank you so much for answering my questions and helping me with this, i think it will also be useful for futur users with same concerns.

1,"My boyfriend and I have had issues lately regarding his mistrust in me due to cheating in some of his past relationships. I have always had my location on Snapchat on for friends and family so I figured it would be alright for him to have it too.

Over the past couple of weeks, there have been multiple instances where my phone dies or I put it on airplane mode, and my location moves approx. 100-500 meters away from where I actually am. He has brought this up to me a multitude of times and I always tell him the truth - that I’m not in those locations, and try to provide some proof to ease his fears. The obvious answer is to turn my location off. I actually did. However, it still gets into his head at times and has gotten increasingly worse because everything online says Snapchat’s map is unfailingly accurate.

My question is this: Could my phone dying/airplane mode mess with my location, despite my location only updating when I open the app?

For reference, my phone is a 6s and has a cracked screen as well as an issue where the ringer spams on/off on its own. Maybe some of that info has to do with it, but I doubt it.

Thanks in advance for any advice/answers you may have!Snap Map seems to be destroying my relationship."

ByteDance, the China-based tech company that owns TikTok, is being investigated to determine if the user data it collects is stored securely. Critics have raised concerns that the data could be shared with the Chinese authorities.

Despite being much newer than other platforms, TikTok has been growing rapidly, reaching 1.5 billion downloads earlier this year. The app’s popularity has placed it in direct competition with Facebook and Instagram. Although Instagram, having reached 1 billion active users in 2018, is still bigger than TikTok, the latter was downloaded nearly 250 million more times than Instagram in 2019 and is on the verge of surpassing the picture-sharing app in active users too.""

I have a dedicated room for using my PC, and I can set up another desk for a monitor and periferals. Is there a program that allows me to split the power of my system so she can play games? I have a pretty good system, (9600k+2080s and would get more ram as I’m sure that would be needed) and she wouldn’t be playing anything super fancy.

1,"I have recently seen a lot of speed-runs of games on youtube, where games that is build to last for hours, days or even weeks, are completed in a tiny fraction of that time, using pre learned knowledge of what's ahead. And this got me thinking, could such be achieved in real life as well? So let's consider the following thought experiment to outline the roadmap to technology:

 Lets say 10m people picked at random were suddenly teleported to another planet: 

\- The planet was like earth but without humans. 

\- The climate was temperate/mediterranean, with an initial abundance of game and forageable vegetables. 

\- They spawn on this new would completely naked.

How long would it take them to rebuild modern civilization?

And the sub-questions: 

\- What would happen initially? Hunger game like anarchy, or would some order remain? 

\- Would it be a long stone age, or would metalgury be reinvented shortly? 

\- Can large communities exist without domesticated agriculture, and modern technology? 

\- Could some inventions be hurried like concrete, gunpowder, the steam engine, or fertilizer, or does all of these rely on other inventions or production infrastructure to occur?Assume 10m people where teleported to an earth-like planet, without humans, how long would it take them to reinvent everything?"

Mitchell explains where we are today in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and where we might be going. Despite the hype and excitement surrounding AI, Mitchell argues that much of what is called ""learning"" and ""intelligence"" when done by machines is not analogous to human capabilities. The capabilities of machines are highly limited to explicit, narrow tasks with little transfer to similar but different challenges. Along the way, Mitchell explains some of the techniques used in AI and how progress has been made in many areas.

در این روزها که سرمان به مشکلات ریز و درشت زندگی گرم است، چه بهانه ای بهتر از «شب یلدا» برای شاد بودن، برای فراموشی غمی که بر دلهایمان نشسته، برای حس دوباره «زندگی»... و چه زیباست که این شادی را در کنار دوستانمان جشن بگیریم و با هم خاطره سازی کنیم.

امسال نیز همچون سال های گذشته، مدیریت شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان شرایطی را ایجاد کردند که کارمندان و مدیران، مانند دوستانی دیرپا و قدیمی، در کنار یکدیگر جمع شده و لحظاتی شاد و به یاد ماندنی را تجربه کنند. نکته ای که بیش از همه برای مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر جای افتخار دارد، افزایش تعداد کارمندان و دوستان جدیدمان نسبت به سال گذشته است. به طوری که می توان گفت که جمعیت شرکت ایده برتر نسبت به همین مقطع در سال گذشته، دو برابر شده و با قدرت بیشتری به سمت موفقیت و آینده ای درخشان در حال حرکت است. از حضور تک تک دوستان در جمع مان خوشحالیم و به خود می بالیم که توانستیم لحظاتی هر چند کوتاه، شادی را به دل هایشان بیاوریم.

در کنار جشن یلدای 98، مجموعه شرکت ایده برتر پارسیان از لوگوی جدید خود نیز رونمایی کرد. امیدواریم با استواری در مسیری که آغاز کرده ایم، روز به روز به پیشرفتمان ادامه داده و بتوانیم رضایت شما را بیش از پیش جلب نماییم.

1,I work for a state agency and have been asked to create a listserv for communicating with a group of folks around the state. But are listservs really the best way to do this? I work in a field where the people I work with have mixed levels of technology. I would like to make this easy on everyone but also using the most efficient method... What are my options?Is a listserv the best way to communicate with a professional group?
1,"Early this morning, I was a awoken by a random phone call. It was an electronic voice saying that someone was using my SIN number to do illegal activities an d to press 1 if I wanted to avoid arrest. Normally I would just hang up, but I was tired and pressed 1 more on instinct than anything else, as it was early and I was tired. If the person on the other end asked for information like my bank info or SIN or whatever, I would have just hung up. But what concerns me is that after I said ""Hello?"" there was a brief moment of silence, followed by the phone just kind of made a quick noise, vibrated, and then the call ended.

I am not really concerned, as I have no real personal information on my phone, I just use it for emergencies, I don't even use the internet on it or bring it with me if I go out. I basically just have it if I need to make a call or text a friend. I do all my banking and stuff online and my more personal info is all done through e-mail, which is not connected to my phone. I get texts saying how much my bill is each month and that's the extent of it.

At the same time however, I am technologically illiterate (it's one reason I don't really use my phone for anything, and just have it for emergencies, due to the expectations of living in the modern world). And it just seems odd to me a scammer would call, and when I pressed 1, not try to extract personal information out of me, but simply hang up. And I don't know what the vibrating thing was all about. So I just thought I'd ask people on here what it was about and if I should be concerned.I am a Canadian citizen in the GTA area, and I pressed 1 on a cell phone scam. My phone vibrated a moment then I got disconnected. Is there any cause for concern?"

I describe how this asymmetry is a consequence of automated bots - and is thus universal to all companies who employ them, without backup manpower when bots fail.

I have a detailed plan for an app, that, based on interviewing the public, will be very successful. I have a path/connection to attaining investors, but am not certain it's the right path. The idea is good enough, if I had a qualified developer for my tech lead and/or co-founder, we could run a successful kickstarter campaign. An instructional designer and a marketer would also be valuable on the team. Please let me know if you would like to learn more so I don't have to hand most of the profit to investors and so we can expand and improve the product optimally.

With my last phone, the device started to glitch out and break after a few years of me having it (since apparently phones are engineered to slow down as the years pass so that people are more likely to buy newer models or whatever). And I lost a lot of photos because I didn't have most of them backed up on another platform. 

Currently, I use Google Photos and/or DropBox. But I found out DropBox isn't that great because people have found that it's not as secure as it should be (?). And well Google Photos is only somewhat secure even though it offers unlimited storage, which is what I was hoping to have. 

Anyone using a better app to store files and images/videos? I need to make sure my stuff is backed up this time, in case something happens to my phone.What is the best app for filing storage?"

# Philips Digital Photo Frame With SD Slot issue

📷

I have previously purchased a Philips digital photo frame, model nos 9FF2CWO/05 via Ebay. I tested it with some SD cards i had and for some bizarre reason, it wouldn't acknowledge them whatsoever in the SD card slot. I tried Transcend, Sandisk, Lexar etc and also different types like SD, SDHC, SD Ultra. I also tried formatting the cards in different file systems, as i know that can also make a difference. I tried FAT, FAT32 and NTFS and still nothing. In the end, i sent the frame back to the seller as being faulty, despite them saying it had worked with their SD Ultra card before. Anyway, I decide to get another frame, exactly the same, same size, same wooden bezel etc and guess what...same issue!

This is the same model from a different seller. The only cards either frame will accept or acknowledge is CF (Compact Flash) and possibly Sony Memory Stick. What are the chances of getting the exact same model with the same fault ? Plus if I get 2 in a row (well infact 3 because I've had a 7"" before with almost the exact same fault) then surely it's a high percentage with this weird SD card slot issue. When i google for philips digital photo frame SD card slot issue, nothing specific comes up as if it's not a known fault.

I'm completely baffled. even tried upgrading/replacing the firmware....still no changePhilips Digital Photo Frame With SD Slot issue"

Missiles locking on a target after being launched was already a big step but we have seen they can be beaten or ditched with some cheeky tricks.

Its not difficult to understand that we can precisely define the possible routes of any moving targets by studying the required parameters properly. So if these quantum computers can predict all the possible routes of the target which is already on the move. The bigger missile which can consist of other smaller but pretty damaging explosives can be launched with the help of our A.I in all those possible points of impact making this weapon an unbeatable one. And all this happens in less than a minute, in a few seconds infact, if I'm not wrong.

I think those small exploding balls that iron man releases to cause troubles to his enemies which hit the target at different regions could be based on this but if it was this thing than the suit didnt considered 'all' possible escape routes.  Most probably it was random but who knows!Is this thing already developed or am I the first to bring this thought into existence???"

My friend in NYC told me I should look into the ITP at NYU. It looks fascinating.

[https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp/courses/itp-courses)

Basically it covers a lot of ground in terms of the diverse application of new and emerging technology but keeps it within the creative domain.

Can anyone recommend a much cheaper/free comparative program? Many international schools have government-funded education that sometimes applies to international students as well so it does not have to be in the US).

*Note: I realize many of you are ready to recommend I take the ultimate free option and skip grad school. True. I hear you. That will be the case if there are no better options.*

My background: I graduated from the most competitive program in the #1 public art school in the nation and I am looking to swing the opposite way now. I am very good with computers and have a great deal of personal experience with them. Please keep in mind: I am not looking for this degree to set me up with a specialized tech job—I am more into using it to reach creative/personal goals like inventing. I have friends who are knee-deep in training their own coding/neural-network projects after going to grad school for tech following an undergrad in art.

Recommendations anyone?NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications Masters Program — Similar Programs?"

Facebook  could easily install something like gauge meters near articles from the top 3 fact check websites that give percentages as to the legitamacy of the article and let the user decide if they want to engage the data.

Whats stopping YouTube from implementing say, a ‘clickbait indicator’, next to each video thats controlled by the users? meaning, as users watch the video they have the ability to click a counter of some sort that gives users an idea if a video is clickbait or not.

I cant figure out the incentive for them to not do these things.

Wouldnt that clean up most of the trash content?

Is this as easy a fix as i think it is?

I dont see this type of implementation reducing views, what am i missing here?Why dont sites like Facebook and YouTube do something about disinformation and clickbait?"

1,"Google is good at what they are doing. So good that their services slowly but surely dominated my online life, and just until now I didn't really see anything bad with it.

Google Maps helps me navigating my city, the world. Fast. Google Mail helps me to connect with my friends, my colleagues and everybody else online. Google Drive holds pretty much every piece of information around my taxes, payslips, apartment, loans, mortgages, invoices and what not for now over 10 years. Google, more precisely YouTube, is hosting almost 2,000 short videos of my son growing up. So far, so convenient.

And then there was this Christmas cookie video that brought the love story to a standstill: uploaded on December 23, I woke up the next morning with a text message from YouTube telling that my account has been disabled for violation of their terms and conditions.

&gt;Well, they didn't like that cake I uploaded last night!

The text message was right, I have been indeed disconnected from all the different Google services and wasn't able to log back in. No more emails, no more docs, no more maps, and no more kid videos for friends and family: Christmas 2019 announced itself to be offline.

Shit happens, YouTube has 30 million users a day and adds every single minute new videos of 500 hours! I know that only automation through algorithms can deal with this and that things sometimes go wrong. [I appealed](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/recoveryidentifier) on Christmas day and acknowledged the confirmation message, expecting things to be fixed very soon:

*Request Received*

*The Google Accounts team will review your request and be in touch with an update as soon as possible. Most requests take 2 business days to review, but some might take longer.*

*Thanks for your patience.*

The two days went by, so did the week and the year. I wasn't too worried yet, it's been Christmas holidays and Googlers deserve their vacations too. I only started to seriously worry two weeks in the wait, when I tried and failed to make my case heard. You need to know that Google cannot be reached by email, nor by phone, nor is there anybody responsible for answering user requests. Further more I realized that I was not the only one to be trapped in this machine between YouTube and Google. Thanks to the [Google Accounts Community board I finally got some answers](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/26021187), although they didn't bring me any closer to my lost data. Even worse, since my question has been transferred to the YouTube Community board I haven't heard back at all.

Since I'm deprived from so many cool sites and services ever since the incident, I started to move away from Google service by service. I found the checklist on [No More Google](https://nomoregoogle.com/) fun and helpful, and instead of one very powerful friend I now have many: Firefox, ProtonMail, DuckDuckGo, Vimeo, Dropbox, ...

The fact that Google doesn't have a valid process to correct things that went awry is unacceptable. Since I am living in France I am now using the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), that is in place since May 2018, to get my data back. According to the law I am entitled to a full copy of my data within 30 days of the request. Will Google comply? I keep you updated!Google banned me because they didn't like my son's Christmas cookies"

1,"The terms cloud and cloud computing are used very often, but what is actually behind it? In this article we explain the different terms in an understandable way.

The term cloud has established itself as a short form of cloud computing .

Briefly summarized: The term cloud means the interaction of several servers. The servers take on tasks such as data storage or complicated program sequences. The cloud user does not notice how many servers are behind the cloud.

Even if one server fails, it has no impact on the entire system. This independence from the individual servers is therefore referred to as cloud, since the user does not have to have an overview of the individual units (cloudy / unclear for the user). The cloud is the big picture of these computing units.

Cloud / cloud does not mean that your data is only transmitted via “clouds” or satellites. Everything essentially takes place on Earth and your “normal” internet connection via radio towers, routers, cables and data centers is used.

  
Business Cloud: This term is used by this website to identify offers that are aimed at companies.

Cloud computing: see above, means the interaction of several servers that take on tasks as a whole and can provide storage space, for example.

Community Cloud: means the cloud as a (local) community project. A user group gets together and shares the costs for the project. For example, a community cloud from several universities or colleges is conceivable.

Hybrid cloud: A combination of the private cloud and public cloud, depending on individual needs.

[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) In contrast to PaaS and SaaS, IaaS takes effect at the lowest level, the hardware compilation. This cloud service provides you with servers that you yourself divide into your own virtual computer clusters , i.e. computer networks. You are responsible for the selection of any software.

[Multi Cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) Based on the idea of the hybrid cloud, several cloud offers are linked and bundled here.

Network Attached Storage (NAS): Any cloud software offers more than just storage and therefore goes beyond a NAS. However, if, for example, your own hard drive is made available via the router in the network, this is referred to as NAS storage space that is available via the network.

NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA): The US institute developed a definition of the cloud . More details can be found in the next section on this page.

[Platform as a Service (PaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/)PaaS acts between IaaS and SaaS on the 2nd level. You will have access to a completely set up software environment in which you can also run your own software, for example.

Private cloud: own computer structure or own cloud. This can be an in-house cloud or the small cloud server in your living room.

[Public cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/)IT infrastructures or a cloud that is publicly accessible. On our site, we also refer to providers as so-called cloud hosters.

[Software as a Service (SaaS):](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) is also referred to as software on demand. You can use selected software that runs on the servers in the cloud. You have only limited influence over the software. Some web applications, such as an online office offering, can already be referred to as SaaS.

[Virtual private cloud:](https://dficlub.org/what-is-cloud-computing/) A public cloud is accessed via a local (virtual) environment. The protection is usually done by a VPN.

\- Blank ssd is in there now, and formatted as MS-DOS + Master Boot Record  
\- Sandisk Cruze USB drive i've purchased, I also formatted the same.  
\- Extracted windows 7 .iso contents and copied to USB drive.   
\- Inserted in blank computer, and on startup, made sure I went into the BIOS to change the priority boot drive to the sandisk. 

One thing i've noticed is that in BIOS, I can set the priority to ""Sandisk Cruze USB"" OR ""USB CD"". I've tried both, but still get ""PXE Media Test Failure. Check cable"" error.   


 ...and i'm unsure how to move on from here.   


I've also  tried using ""unetbootin"" to make the bootable instead of manually copying the contents of the .iso over as well. Problem still exists.   


Again, any help would be swell!Help with Windows Boot on USB Drive"

I unplugged the Ethernet cable (one site suggested to do that) and I went to sleep at 10, figuring that in the morning, it would be finished.

I wake up at five to get ready for school, school’s cancelled, and so now I am here. I check the progress. It is still at 75%.

1,"So I want to start off by saying I have been a loyal Samsung user since the Galaxy S3. I have had a S3-S10. New S series every year. I have had about 3 different Samsung smart watches and of course, the Galaxy buds. A little over a year ago (with my S9+) I started having issues with my phone receiving all notifications at once, which makes replying to texts super inconvenient, and apps would not full download/install. I went through the whole clear cache, force stop app, factory reset, even sent the phone to Samsung to have them look at it to resolve it, all with no avail. I endured for the rest of the year because I knew the new and improved Galaxy S10 was coming out in 2019. I received the upgrade of the S10 with open hearts and minds. The phone was great......for about 4 months, then out of nowhere, the exact same issues yet again. I called Samsung and told them that all the troubleshooting steps they could even find to give me, I had already done. I even went to a Samsung walk-in store and got my phone software re-flashed, still having the same issues. I looked online to just see multiple forums of people having the same issues all the way back to the S4!!! How Samsung? How are we still having this issue? I decided that it was time to switch, but to what? As a Verizon customer, I don't have the ability to look into these newer Android devices that are smashing the market for half the price. I was led straight to the Google pixel 4xl. After watching tens of videos of reviewers bashing the pixel for lack of innovation, I decided I would go against the grain and get one and my verdict..........well worth it!!

 The pixel is Google's phone that just works! The software is clean, the features work, and the phone is fast. I kept the Samsung watch and buds because, in my opinion, they are the best Android watch and buds on the market. To my surprise, pairing the watch and buds were more seamless (after downloading the app) then on a Samsung phone! How Samsung? How does Google use your software better than you? As a long time Samsung customer I can say without certainty that I am truly let down by Samsung.

Most phone producers that Excel in the Android market, do so by listening to their customers. That was OG Samsung. They took away the SD card on a s6, we were outraged, they fixed it. Now look at the Note 10!! No headphone jack, no SD card? What happened to the no compromise phone? Samsung, I am begging you, listen to your customers, listen to the people who made you the company you are today. Clean up your software, quit rushing into advanced features in your phones that you can't make seamless in your devices. I'm not turned off of Samsung forever that's for sure, they have given me good phones in the past, but for the next year, I'm sitting high and happy with my Pixel!

Sincerely, A disappointed customerWhy I switched from the S10 to the Google Pixel 4XL"

So I have an origin account and it was logged into by someone in Russia I know this as the email I received indicated the country of origin. 

So I changed my password for my linked Email and the password for the EA account itself.  I also added a 2 step verification to my account which sends my phone a code that needs to be input before anyone can log in to my EA account. My Email also has this system now.

In the last couple of days I have had multiple codes sent to my phone and the text is always in Russian. The thing that’s bugging me is that whoever or whatever it is has cracked my password multiple times. as the the only way to get a code sent to my phone is by successfully entering my password. 

I know for a fact that it’s not my email as I have recovery set up with another linked email address which informs me of weird activity or log ins from other countries which I never get. So I think it may be an issue with EA’s security maybe? I don’t know but if anyone has any insight on this or any helpful information I’d really appreciate it.

1," Hey there!

I want to buy a laptop. I'll be using this laptop mainly for work, in this case it's programming.

I'm thinking about these two models:

\- MSI 14"" Modern 14 A10M-497XPT ( CPU: i5-10210U Quad-Core + 16GB RAM + 512 SSD Nvme PCIe)

\- MSI 14"" Modern 14 A10M-496XPT (CPU: i7-10510U Quad-Core + 16GB RAM + 512 SSD Nvme PCIe)

Thge price difference from the i7 to the i5 is about 100€ (or 110 US $).

What do you guys think? Should I go to the i7 or for the i5 version?

If you have other tips or laptops, you can share it as well :D

Thanks in advance! :)Trouble choosing a laptop"

Without a doubt, Google Chrome is one of the best Browser you can get. Microsoft also hop on the Train and made Edge based on Google Chromium open sauce code. The only issue I have with Google Chrome and Edge based Chromium Browser is that I'M the product. I don't want a company to save everything I do.

There is an alternative called [Brave](https://brave.com/pun788) which focus on secure, fast &amp; private browsing. Brave loads popular web pages 3x to 6x faster, while using \~1/2 the memory &amp; power, and 1/3 of data (saving you time &amp; megabytes of data for every page load). ([source](https://brave.com/brave-one-dot-zero-performance-methodology-and-results/))

Brave also offers rewards in form of BAT Token for viewing promoted ads which is optional for you.

Brave does not block 1st Patry ads, such as reddit promoting own posts etc. If you also want block them I would suggest to install uBlock extention.

If you want to give [Brave](https://brave.com/pun788) a try and have questions, don't hesitate to PM me or comment in this thread.

My friends and I (4th year CS students) have been working on a news aggregation website that we aim to solve the problem of selective facts and biased reporting in readers' news browsing experience by utilizing the power of comparison. Basically, our ML-based algorithm picks up news topics a reader might or have been interested in, and search them against a large database of tagged news aggregated from multiple sources / publishers, then present news reports from different publishers on the same topic in a side-by-side fashion with multiple ""news comparison options"" to choose from (we are planning on supporting comparing news based on media bias, source country and reporting tones).

But there was one rule: No taking pictures of the phone or posting it on Social Media. My question is, why not? If you go online, especially YouTube, and look up “Pixel 4”, you’re gonna see reviews, information, pictures, videos and all of that about the phone already. If you wanna know everything about the phone, just look it up. So what’s the problem with me posting a picture and giving information about the phone online as well? There’s nothing that I could post, that hasn’t already been leaked and/talked about.

Also, if phone companies don’t want information about an unreleased product/ phone going out, then NOBODY should be able to share information about it, on any platform.Unreleased products and information"

1,"***Everyone has a right to privacy***. Whether that’s the privacy afforded in our homes, whilst we are trying on new clothes at the local fashion store or simply communicating with loved ones and friends online. Physical privacy is quite an easy concept to understand and monitor; if you’re not being watched or listened to by anyone else, then you are protected. Online privacy is a little harder to understand and police. This article will be focusing specifically on online communication and why it's important to have the ability to speak freely over the internet.

## Why Is Secure/Private Messaging Important?

When most people think online privacy they tend to automatically think ‘illegal’ activities. This is a rather strange assumption to make seeing as we highly value our physical privacy but don’t make those same assumptions in the real world when somebody calls for privacy — eg. visiting the bathroom or getting changed into your sleepwear.

Whether you are sending confidential business documents or sending raunchy photos to your loved one, the ability to remain private (and secure) with our online communications should be a fundamental right for all internet users. Here are some of the main reasons why a regular user would value secure and private messaging:

* **Identity Theft.**  This is something we should all be concerned about. It’s all too easy to share sensitive photos and information through messengers (like drivers licence/passport or bank account information). Armed with these bits of data, a criminal could pose as yourself and carry out a number of identity attacks.
* **Being Advertised To.**  We’ve all woken up and jumped online to find that something you spoke about the day before with a friend is now being advertised to you online. Advertisers bid for your information so that they can sell you their products and this is how the vast majority of  *‘free’*  messaging apps make their revenue. *BE WARY*
* **Business Dealings.** You are sharing or discussing sensitive information regarding a business. This could be legally mandated through an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) or just sensitive intellectual property not wished to be leaked.
* **Whistleblower or Journalist.**  When reporting on the news in countries where they may not wish to have that news reported, journalists could find themselves in trouble if found out. Using insecure messaging apps could literally land someone in jail, or worse.
* **Privacy, Because I Can.** It’s okay and totally valid to want privacy in your online communications. You could be talking with loved ones or dealing with a stranger for a service. Either way, secure and private communication online should be afforded to you.

## What Can YOU Do to Protect Yourself?

Thankfully staying safe online is getting easier due to the advancements in software and technology. No longer do you have to rely on old and clunky forms of communication like fax, SMS or email. Instant messengers are all too common these days, but unfortunately, they aren’t all made equal. Here are some basic tips for choosing the right app:

1. **E2EE (end-to-end-encryption).** This is a  ***MUST***. E2EE is a method of secure communication that prevents third-parties from accessing data while it’s transferred from one end system or device to another. The data is encrypted (locked &amp; secured) on the sender’s system or device and only the recipient is able to decrypt (unlock &amp; read) it.
2. **Open Source.** Open Source refers to the code written to build the application which is released under a license whereby the copyright holder grants users the right to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Basically, it’s them opening their doors saying ‘we have nothing to hide, look for yourself’.
3. **Third-Party Audit.** Applications that are to be taken seriously will welcome third party audits of their software. This generally involves a qualified and independent company reviewing the application and fact-checking all their claims for validity.
4. **Data Collection.** As mentioned above, the vast majority of apps will be ‘free’ to use but the real trade-off is that they are collecting enormous amounts of data in the back end and selling that off to advertisers for a huge profit. This is  **YOUR**  digital data and by using these apps you are welcoming these companies to make money off you and your, supposedly private, conversations.

## So, Which App(s) Should I Use?

The options are almost endless and it’s likely that you may already use some of the more popular apps out there. It seems every single one of my friends uses a different app to communicate which can be tiring to manage. However, there is really only a select few worth recommending that stick to the above principles and really care about their user's security and privacy.

**My current #1 recommendation is** [**Signal**](https://signal.org/)**.**  It adheres to all of the above points, is run by a Not for Profit foundation and has a solid track record when it comes to security/privacy. There are some features I would still like Signal to improve on, mainly the removal of the requirement for a mobile phone number to create an account, but for now, it’s going to hold my #1 spot. If you want to learn more about Signal, stay tuned for my upcoming review of their app.

1,"I live in Ontario, Canada and about a few times a week I get called from a random number from the US. Places include Houston, Atlanta, Reading, Riverside, Herber City, Spring Valley, Burbank and Ogden, to name some. It’s pretty random. They always leave voicemails, but all you can hear is faint white noise. I haven’t answered a single one because I keep my phone on silent but the only other scam calls I’ve gotten were pre recorded in Chinese and it was an unknown number, whereas the American ones show to complete number and location. And it’s never the same location twice.

The first call I got was on November 18th and I have been getting them once or twice a week, a different city everytime. Does anyone else deal with this too, especially in Canada or Ontario?
